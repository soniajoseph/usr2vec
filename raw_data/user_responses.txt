06yhAq7hMRcVgEsRPJC9r3sOILP2	well, there's two that are I'm very close with one that probably understands me the most and one that I like to have fun with so in total for 
06yhAq7hMRcVgEsRPJC9r3sOILP2	If I was able to talk to Zach about what happened over the weekend and know how he was feeling.  And my friends have my back about things the ones here dead, but the one back home didn't. 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	No me. You suggested some ideas to improve my mood
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	Raising a child without his mother wanting to be involved. 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	I have a femur break and shatter into places and it took two years to learn to walk again.  I can't walk now. Although I do have some pain. So I'm limited how much I can work out, but I can work out and I want to build on that. 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	"He resents being a single dad. The grandsons mother abandoned him and my son is left to raise him alone. With our help
"
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	Lack of communication. Lack of forgiveness toward children. 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	It's Christmas time and I want my family clothes. Just looking at the Christmas tree and remembering.  him being around  he's not here and everybody else is.  Makes it hard. 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	I really don’t know. I really don’t
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	I’m 50/50 on it. I haven’t reached out to them already because they have made no attempt to respond to any correspondence I’ve sent
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	my husband  because he's a good friend and a good provider.  My grandson because he's very loving and silly and goofy.  My middle son because he's very wise and thoughtful.  And he loves me a great deal. 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	Feeling better, not as sick. 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	Thank you for listening. It helps to help me process how I’m feeling and the suggestions are very helpful. I will do some of what you suggested to improve my mood. Again. Thank you :)
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	If nothings changed maybe worse
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	My adult son not communicating with me and his dad. Son is making poor life choices and instead of correcting the bad behavior, he has just stopped being in our lives so he won’t hear that he is doing wrong. 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	I'm still working on a lot of that, but I definitely want to work on my health and getting in better shape. 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	Well, I tried to not think about it.  And I tried to do something else to take my mind off of it.  I tried having a cup of coffee.  I tried calling a friend.  all those things helped  but I still am experiencing a sense of loss. I feel like I'm grieving.  Because he just doesn't want to be in our life anymore.  Through no fault of our own. 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	That everyone is under difficult pressure in life. And most are willing to extend grace. But it is wisdom to be mindful  of this towards others. And for ourselves as well. 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	I can’t let others bad attitude make mine the same. There are a lot of folks with negative mind sets. I want to do better. 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	That I’m feeling much more positive then last week
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	"Life is full of change. You need to roll with the changes
"
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	Yes. And I have. I do get their perspective. But I feel that it’s unforgiving for someone who claims to be a Christian to be unforgiving when we are called to always be forgiving if we want to be forgiven. There is no understanding trying to control others and micro manage their life. To not have a real respect for them. To lie regularly about important things like going to counseling , porn, hiding spending while controlling mine, cheating ( in the past I hope) , respecting me, ( he doesn’t, he may have a love for me, but I don’t believe he is in love with me like I am with him, and I know he doesn’t have real respect for me. He only sees my faults)
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	I will achieve my New Year's resolutions. 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	Some affirmations, do my nails, remind myself that I am only responsible for my conduct. Others are responsible for theirs. To let go of the pain of my children’s choices and focus on some self care and protection for my own  physical and mental health. To reflect on my life and sift through what mental baggage I carry, or actions i have from the past that I need to regroup on to not find myself dragged into other peoples issues. To let go of the outcome and let God handle it
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	A bit sad about adult son not communicating with me
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	I allow myself to be who I am without judgment
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	I deserve the love I am given. 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	I will exhale my fears and breathe in confidence 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	I will take action to create the life I way
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	The more I give the more I will receive
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	I always deserve to be treated with love and respect
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	I am good enough just as I currently am. 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	I am becoming closer to my true self everyday 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	"Poorly. His way or the highway. Period. 
He could take my perspective into account when making decisions. My perspective should affect his decisions as they affect me too. It’s my life too. Everything from how I fill a soap dispenser to how I cook to what I buy is judged scrutinized and deemed unfit in lieu of his perspective. 
He devalues me. "
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	For my son to be more engaged with his son so I don’t end up doing it all. I’ll just say it
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	I don’t have anything I’m excited about 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	I'm looking forward to this being Friday the end of the week. I have a couple days off after this and spending time with my sweetheart. 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	Christmas shopping and spending time with my husband mostly spending time with my husband. 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	My middle son who is wise and thoughtful of me his mom
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	I'm feeling grateful. I'm alive after a motorcycle accident. I am feeling grateful that we are going to be able to remodel.  I am feeling grateful that I'll have a bathtub again.  I'm feeling grateful. I've been feeling better health-wise.  I'm feeling grateful. I have good friends. 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	Creativity. It allows me to express myself in great ways. 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	It gives me hope. I just hope it’s not false hope
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	Taking grandson to school 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	Running into my son shopping. That was nice
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	It make me feel used. Disrespected. I have tried to explain but he just starts a fight and says that’s why I never talk. There is no point. Etc
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	I’ve done that, they all say let him go. But he is my child. I cannot. 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	I will em is everything that life throws my way
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	I will make positive choices for myself
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	I want to focus on the positive instead of the negative 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	I will always stand up for myself. 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	I have trust in myself to make the right decisions
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	"Flying there to see him. Don’t think he wants to see me. 
Writing him. He would throw it away. "
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	I could play my guitar for awhile :)
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	that would be  crazy awesome 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	Dismissing my perspective and dismissing the  conversation 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	In 2020, I will focus my thoughts actions and emotions to create my best year yet. 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	Keep trying. I have no other choice
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	I do best with 8 hours of sleep. But typically only get 5
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	Always busy. And involved. It’s just hard to not be sad when I see the son I’ve raised to be a good man, act horrible to his wife. 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	He tried calling me for months and I was often to busy to talk. But we still did talk a lot. After his dad and him had a falling out, he decided to punish me for everything and everybody else’s lack of communication. He is hurt that his dad didn’t answer his phone for him for a month.  Which is the same thing he did to his dad when he was cheating and his dad tried to reach out. He left his wife and his parent to clean up his mess. Then got mad at us for not liking it. 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	It's been on and off now for months. 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	Christmas prep. Feel better 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	"I’ve tried talking about it. But he won’t change. He refuses to see my point of view as having merit. I am heartbroken, and you would think that would influence him wanting to continue trying to communicate, and to keep engaging with our kids. But he views emotion as a huge weakness. So how I feel, to him is invalid. 
This makes me feel invalid as a person. My husband would never take my advice. He only takes his own advice. He doesn’t really need me for anything other then occasional sex. And to clean the house. I’m in love with him and he just wanted a pretty wife. He didn’t want ME. "
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	Rejection, failure, sad, crying
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	I got everything done. And spent time crafting towels ( flour sack towels , stenciled)
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	Yes finished all my tasks 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	Yes! I got everything I planned to do finished. 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	I think some realistic Milestones would be just being able to breathe easier when I exercise being able to start at one point and be able to achieve goals of increasing that time that I can work out in the past has been hard for me to work out for extended periods. I'm hoping that I can build up to more extended periods of work out until I can get to a point where I can do a full workout. Nothing crazy. Just you know a regular for workout good, you know, 20 minutes to 40 minute workout. I would be really nice to be able to do several times a week. I was felt better when I was working out before my injury. And so I look forward to those benefits now. 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	My husband. He is a rock of strength in our family. 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	Sick but not getting worse. 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	It's quiet at home today. I appreciate that. 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	To see two of my grandchildren doing better in life. 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	I think I've struggled with anxiety my whole life.  But this particular anxiety.  Has been going on ever since he's left home and started making poor life choices. 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	I'm having a difficult time letting go of feeling abandoned by my oldest son.  really frustrated that his life choices  His poor decisions is hurting his wife over and over and over again by cheating to the point where she breaks down and calls his parents for comfort and advice.  intercept always blowing up in our face  I'm tired of feeling like he's blaming us for.  you know not having communication between us but the truth is he stopped communicating with us, you know, his dad stopped talking to him for about 30 days and  because he was hurt by him hurting his wife and maybe that wasn't the best choice. But at the same time he has a right to be hurt by what his son is done. He's disappointed and what is done is done as I am and for him to say the things that he said the last time I spoke to him saying that, you know, he regrets not paying respects to his bio dad when he passed away out of respect for his stepdad, and now calling his stepdad Robert instead of  Calling him dad.  I know that he's hurt but you know, he's continually made poor choices since he ran away at 16 years old and it's like  Chase after him we've we've work so hard to be in this life while he's put up a nominal effort and the minute him and his dad stepdad had a falling out. It was like he didn't make any effort to try and have a relationship with me his biological mom and it's like I haven't done anything wrong. I've always been there for him and he treats me like I'm  like toxic and like I've done hurtful things to him and  I don't deserve this.  I don't deserve to be treated like  like I haven't invested in his life.  My whole life has been for my children and it just like  his punish me.  For years and years and years and years. He's punished me and now this like the ultimate punishment that just cut me out of his life and I sent him a Christmas present and I didn't even get a thank-you. I live in a text. Thank you.  I don't want to access about this. I don't want it to meet me bitter and angry and retaliatory. I  I want to let it go but hurts so much and it catches me.  I'm prepared sometimes like a sucker punch to the gut and makes me cry. I just feel rejected and I'm sure part of that is just like  I'm already sensitive being rejected from my childhood and to have my son who I I poured everything into my whole life. I put everything in to reject me is just  It hurts so much.  I don't know how to get past it. I'm trying to be mindful and trying to stay grounded.  I'm trying to.  speak affirmations to myself  But it's starting to feel like I'm always going to be rejected. Like I have to expect it from anybody and everybody and I'll just be on guard. It's no way to live.  part  hurt  I want to feel like my son loves me.  Good night. Now I don't and  It's really hurting me  I don't know how to get past this.  I'm trying though. I'm not going to give up today. I'm going to stay busy and focus on what I can control with a focus on working on a home.  And I'm getting my home up to where it needs to be since Christmas.  I try not to think about it because pretty much crying everyday at this point. It's just making me miserable and those around me miserable.  It's hard to remind myself that I'm a good person. But I am going to do a lot of good for a lot of people.  and even though he wants to diminish that in me, that's a weakness in him, and I know that  so I need to let go of his opinion of me.  Stand on my own truth.  Doesn't help that I feel diminished by the other men in my life my own home.  Hopefully tomorrow will be better. 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	A white jacket I have. Fits me well looks good

I do not get this in return at all"
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	Christmas shopping and errands
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	I’m not as sick as I was, and the day went well overall. 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	Some days I push myself too hard other days. I don't push myself hard enough. I push myself hard enough for others. I don't always push myself hard enough for myself. 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	Christmas shopping wrapping presents  spending some time with my husband. 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	Wrapping presents for Christmas. Resting. I feel a bit sick. 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	well, I have an injury a few years back that's sidelined me and I wasn't able to work out physically or do much to improve my health, but I'm on the other side of the injury now and healed and so  I think now I think the only reason I haven't like really fulfilled my resolutions from the past now is that I'm just starting to feel better, but it's still a struggle though because I don't have the energy Reserve that I used to. 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	We used to be very close.  And now because of some bad choices on my son's part.  He has decided to pull himself away from his family.  And he blames us for his choices.  At least some of them.  It's unfair.  And I miss having a relationship with my son. 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	I had made me lose some respect for my partner. And a lack of respect takes my romantic feelings away. 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	"As hard as this is.  It’s been helpful to dump how I’ve been feeling for awhile. I’d like to add that I think the misogyny in our household has been reflected in our boys. He has not always been a good example. At times he has been great. Other times self serving. He told me once , that he was only concerned for his own happiness. That he does what he does for his happiness. Mine wasn’t important. He also said once that he went to counseling and they said I was crazy. Which no counselor would do. He has  said again he went to counseling more recently and I truly truly believe he laid and didn’t go. He in the past has cheated for years and years. Then tried to play it off like I did. I have never cheated on him. I’ve been a good wife. 
I don’t think I have ever been really loved by anyone "
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	That I can rely on my own counsel. And that I am stronger then I credit myself with being
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	That I’m able to be a part of my grandsons life 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	Being physically tired, but I pushed through so I’m feeling grateful
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	I’m scared to lose what little relationship I have with my son. 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	Nothing is missing except his ability to be responsible for his actions and how they hurt others. Affect others. He is being prideful, and not being mindful. 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	for free time to explore the things I enjoy  I feel compelled to experience it because I have done for others my whole life and I'm in a position now where I'm still doing for somebody out of.  I'm having a crisis.  so my  things I've longed to do have had to take a back seat.

079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	I am going to schedule them into my calendar just like an appointment.  And also doing things like making time for myself daily and being mindful when I go grocery shopping and I'm buying things that are not going to tempt me and contribute to poor health.

079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	It would be the greatest heartbreak of my life
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	If it would be wise to contact my son who is pushing me out of their life. 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	His wife. She is not vested in anyone but herself. And she has damaged the family bond in order to win back my son who has cheated on her with over 80 women. This hurts the family to know who badly he is treating women. But she proverbially threw me under the bus. 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	That I will never see or hear from my son or Grandaughter again. Heartbreaking 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	"Continue to stay connected as much as you can. Without hurting yourself emotionally. 
Set healthy boundaries. 
Know yourself. Don’t allow someone who has shown to make bad life choices , tell you who you are. 
Give it time, but stay engaged. 
If the chance to talk to them happens, don’t sell myself short, hold them kindly accountable for their actions. 
Remember a relationship requires both parties to engage
Their lack of  communication is a weakness on their part, not my own. "
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	I'm a little stressed out about my son who is  not living at home and stop talking to me and his father.  He seems like he doesn't want a relationship with us anymore.  at Hertz 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	My son Dustin and my husband my son my youngest son because he also wants to do the same thing. And so we can do it together and my husband because he also wants to lose weight and he does a lot of cooking in our household. So I want him to be supportive because you know, he's part of the equation with the food and also because it's good for him. 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	Not me, his son. My grandson. They live here, and My son ignores his responsibilities to his child, with a expectation I will fill in and do it for him. 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	He is choosing to be not accountable for his actions that hurt others and reflect poorly on his family. It’s sad to see him not be faithful to his wife

079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	In 33 years every attempt to do this has been met with being punished for months with emotional neglect. He has never been compassionate or said I’m sorry that I can remember. I’ve thrown away 33 years being head over heels in love with a misogynist. Now I’m old and broken in body and spirit. My fight is gone. I’m trying to fire up my desire to ignite this relationship with some passion. But with the respect from him not there and the indifference to me and being aware that this is my life too   I don’t know. I’ve lost my way
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	It would be awesome to live forever. I believe in God so I do believe in eternal salvation through  belief in Jesus. But that eternity is in heaven. Not here on earth. I think living forever on earth would be a mixture of things good and bad. I hope humans will work on improving how they behave and treat each other. 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	Nothing. Nothing can stop me from achieving the success I desire.

079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	"Yes I would and have. I’ve done so in a way that show them my reasoning and why I feel the way I do. But my opinions are dismissed out of hand. Like I’m a dumb blonde. 
I deeply love my husband. He can be generous and kind towards me. But he really doesn’t know me at all"
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	By forcing his hand I could force him to verbally say and establish his desire to never see me, his mom, again. 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	That he has been unkind to me. And I deserve to be honored by my son for all the good and help I have given to him and his family over the years
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	Everything went according to my schedule, no problems 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	Everything was peaceful and pleasant 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	"That if I try, he still won’t care to respond. 
That he in reality doesn’t respect me at all
That for some reason he is blaming me for something that I don’t know. 
That he is trying to force his dad to apologize for his own actions before contacting me, so he is hurting me in the hope of make his dad apologize first. 
That there is a part of me that thinks maybe I have failed him
"
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	I could ask his brothers to check on his feeling about talking with me and see what he says. But he isn’t talking to them either at the moment. 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	I was thinking about my son and him not wanting to talk to us anymore. He's an adult and he doesn't live at home anymore. 
079kvKDA8BZiySXLstBcUqpXT2T2	I will meet my goals. Always do. Just not with him in my life. 
086csBx8dLghyCVE92CBiRFUK693	Set back and look at the reason and understand that I sometimes have to wait
086csBx8dLghyCVE92CBiRFUK693	"Steven Furtick because he has lead me
Eminem because his music has given me a passion
Nf because he is normal"
086csBx8dLghyCVE92CBiRFUK693	The happiness of a home with a husband who worships his wife and the kids who smile bc everyone is in the order in which we were all created for 
086csBx8dLghyCVE92CBiRFUK693	Then we would have heaven on the earth 
086csBx8dLghyCVE92CBiRFUK693	How I wish I had a building to have kids and music and I could create an atmosphere instead of being scared to leave bc I might be kicked out or get accused falsely when I get back 
086csBx8dLghyCVE92CBiRFUK693	I do but I can’t control my spouse therefor if my yard looks bad it’s because I’m busy making sure my kids get a proper education 
086csBx8dLghyCVE92CBiRFUK693	Definitely night because I hate getting up early, everyone else does it that way and it’s boring to me
086csBx8dLghyCVE92CBiRFUK693	To open an academy and instruct children through dancing because I believe the next generation is important but I don’t want to teach according to normal education but rather learning how to mold the gift of the child
086csBx8dLghyCVE92CBiRFUK693	Tell when your health decline. 
086csBx8dLghyCVE92CBiRFUK693	Not to judge based on what I was told rather learn myself and come to my own conclusion 
086csBx8dLghyCVE92CBiRFUK693	Yes other than my husband bc he’s nicer to my child and I do not have a voice in my own home

Don't you know it's a waste of time and specially like you catch you just track down many things and it's not really good and just focus on the main things in my life right now, like chemicals in school and everything friends or family tree have positive attitude.  Just be happy for the things that actually matter in your life and not the little things. So yeah, what's a little things matter too, but like people and things that actually care about you.  and  Pay attention to you focus on that don't focus on the things that don't. 
0BH8RwZUHpbqgdyJXp9eHfLBJjK2	found it on the app store 
0DXTnP0AHcg6pPe5dbJebvg9pJt2	My mom seen my apartment. 
0DXTnP0AHcg6pPe5dbJebvg9pJt2	Managing my mental health 🧠
0DXTnP0AHcg6pPe5dbJebvg9pJt2	I think she's going to really like it. 
0GqnvsHAZzYEUk5Bh0u1XHPKhev1	I have a ortho at 11:40 then i might hang out with friends later in the day but not sure yet
0QD7tZsYlehDMwafH1pcEVtnM552	Because I had beat him at a game and was poking fun at him because he lost.
0QD7tZsYlehDMwafH1pcEVtnM552	Some people over eat because they’re bored, or emotional. It really depends on the mental state someone is in. I usually don’t eat enough in day.
0QD7tZsYlehDMwafH1pcEVtnM552	Today I attended one school, but I had 4 different classes and then extracurriculars.
0QD7tZsYlehDMwafH1pcEVtnM552	Nobody asks for my number. 
0QD7tZsYlehDMwafH1pcEVtnM552	Today was pretty good in terms of my classes. I’m still stressed about where me and my roommates are going to live next year, but hopefully it will be resolved soon.
0QD7tZsYlehDMwafH1pcEVtnM552	My friend Victoria realized the way she was thinking about her eating habits was extremely unhealthy and that she needed to start getting that in order. It made me happy that I could help her realize that.
0QD7tZsYlehDMwafH1pcEVtnM552	I would introduce myself by hopefully making them smile or laugh. I try to make a good impression whenever possible when I meet new people.
0QD7tZsYlehDMwafH1pcEVtnM552	Anxiety, bouts of depression, and overthinking.
0QD7tZsYlehDMwafH1pcEVtnM552	Looking at a potential apartment
0QD7tZsYlehDMwafH1pcEVtnM552	Beating Carl in Word Hunt by 100 points and just joking around with him a little about it. It just made me smile in the middle of the day when I was really tired.
0QD7tZsYlehDMwafH1pcEVtnM552	Today was just okay. Classes were fine, but the stress of figuring out my living situation took a toll later on and I’ve developed a headache because of it
0QD7tZsYlehDMwafH1pcEVtnM552	I’m looking forward to this summer and being able to spend time with my friends and maybe go on a road trip with them to Florida.
0QD7tZsYlehDMwafH1pcEVtnM552	I feel like I did get a lot done today. I worked really hard in all my classes and started working on multiple homeworks. I went to all my meetings and talked with my future roommates about potential living situations.
0QD7tZsYlehDMwafH1pcEVtnM552	That I’m a student. I’m tired constantly and need some extra support.
0QD7tZsYlehDMwafH1pcEVtnM552	Making jokes with the people in the Soccomm office, particularly Andrew and his “that’s what she said” jokes were quite on point today.
0QD7tZsYlehDMwafH1pcEVtnM552	Today I’m going to look at an apartment with Abby. After that I have the rest of the day to do homework with an office hour at four.
0QD7tZsYlehDMwafH1pcEVtnM552	I think it was just his way of contributing and trying to make everyone laugh. 
0QD7tZsYlehDMwafH1pcEVtnM552	Just being able to be with them for a long period of time. We’ve never really been able to hang out like that before. I’ve also never really been on a road trip without my family so I think that could be interesting. 
0VQkcoL46aPvkz4qFXtJgQLpNxr1	I am in the process of moving and I’m annoyed and sometimes I over react and make things hard on my boyfriend 
0VzmdP8NPmM5V7fmdSy4xMHgBTr2	It was the first thing that popped up when looking for a diary in the App Store 
0ZByPUqSdob4TWkA0vUC2Fgdxqv2	First I got yelled at my mom cause I was trying to watch a video while she was listening to a audiobook, but that part got better. Then I had a fine day at school until math cause we were doing something I wanted to do but I got called from my reading teacher so I didn’t get to do the thing I wanted in math. Then I get home (aka my cousin’s house cause my mom picks me up from there) and me and my cousins 2 boys (5 yr old Denver and 12 yr old Doug) and 1 girl (11 yr old Alia) then we played Hide & Seek and Alia was the seeker and she found Doug and Denver and she went to find me but she spilled the dogs food so she was cleaning it up and Denver went to the bathroom (not to get into to much detail) and when he came back he said “Hi Doug hi Jahslyn then started walking to where I was hiding and then I stud up and (FYI I have a loud voice so my voice seems really loud sometimes) started telling him that he’s not supposed to say where I’m hiding. Then he ran off into his room crying and saying things that weren’t true. But now he’s fine but she’s being annoying and like being all “mean” around me but it’s not even affecting me 
0ZByPUqSdob4TWkA0vUC2Fgdxqv2	Wait are you the new friend or are we talking about Alia 
0ZByPUqSdob4TWkA0vUC2Fgdxqv2	Mindful daily journaling 📓
0ZByPUqSdob4TWkA0vUC2Fgdxqv2	"More than 1 thing 
•I have anxiety 
•I have anger management issues 
•I need someone to tell all my weird dreams/Strange things I think about 
•I just need someone to tell my day about after school "
0ZByPUqSdob4TWkA0vUC2Fgdxqv2	Everything, my day started off terrible then I thought it got kinda better but now it’s back to being terrible 
0ZByPUqSdob4TWkA0vUC2Fgdxqv2	"I don’t really have “favorite journaling topics” But I’d like to talk about how my day was after school

0ZYlVyyfa8PvejkRDVU9oRgbQK93	I did really well at work organizing and getting stuff done and I finished the taxes and we don't know as much as I thought which is great.

0a11whOLTab9mBg7hcpmkfEn0Zi2	Not often enough, maybe once or twice a year
0a11whOLTab9mBg7hcpmkfEn0Zi2	That’s not quite what I said, but I want to be proud of myself, and my contributions, and currently I am not. And life is not promised. 
0a11whOLTab9mBg7hcpmkfEn0Zi2	I didn’t say that, I said I scolded my brother. But I scolded him twice.
0a11whOLTab9mBg7hcpmkfEn0Zi2	It was pretty unproductive, I didn’t do any homework, I scolded my brother twice. I suspect my mother is still angry at me, but I spent time with my sister. So it wasn’t all bad.
0a11whOLTab9mBg7hcpmkfEn0Zi2	I thought about what would happen if the world ended tomorrow, or if I died. I wouldn’t be satisfied with my life, or my contributions.
0a11whOLTab9mBg7hcpmkfEn0Zi2	I am a psychology student, so I love learning about psychology. I also love to read fiction novels. 
0a11whOLTab9mBg7hcpmkfEn0Zi2	I’m trying to manage my anxiety and depression.
0a11whOLTab9mBg7hcpmkfEn0Zi2	I got angry today. I didn’t feel in control of my emotions.
0a11whOLTab9mBg7hcpmkfEn0Zi2	I like to think that I am extremely empathetic
0a11whOLTab9mBg7hcpmkfEn0Zi2	I’ve felt stuck in a rut due to my mind for so long, I want to succeed. I want to change. 
0a11whOLTab9mBg7hcpmkfEn0Zi2	That I am back in school, and able to attend school. 
0a11whOLTab9mBg7hcpmkfEn0Zi2	Overall, I don’t feel confident in my abilities, in who I am, or how I look. 
0a11whOLTab9mBg7hcpmkfEn0Zi2	I think it would change everything completely, and for the better.

0cDMDMqQwTY9I1Wu6oFqoXv3oSh2	I think thoughts of my dental appointment tomorrow is triggering it 
0cDMDMqQwTY9I1Wu6oFqoXv3oSh2	I told myself to calm down that it Was all in my head and I was okay. Crying only stops up your nose which makes it harder to breathe. Cohen told me I was okay.
0cDMDMqQwTY9I1Wu6oFqoXv3oSh2	It will pass. Don’t cry. Crying makes it harder to breathe. Breathe slowly. Don’t get worked up. Talk about it with Cohen. You’ll be OKAY. I promise.

0dsu4EFLoqRS9M59jwugCX6MdMi2	Things that are change and shifted for the better, I think.  Thing where I am career-wise is something that's new over the last, you know, six to eight months and that's been a good thing. It's been a hard shift, but I'm growing I'm learning from that ending the toxic relationship that I was in I think is the right thing to do, but it hurts really bad.  I think that those are probably the only thing. 
0dsu4EFLoqRS9M59jwugCX6MdMi2	Well, I'm happy about my job because I worked really hard to get it and it's something that I really wanted for a very long time. And now I've achieved it. Most days are good. Some days are great. But I think you were happy and I'm happy because it's not something many people are. Not too many people are able to do and I'm doing it and living as far as my career goes. I'm essentially living room. 
0dsu4EFLoqRS9M59jwugCX6MdMi2	I already told you why Remy? 
0dsu4EFLoqRS9M59jwugCX6MdMi2	Right now I feel like I don't.  No, 100% who I am and what I'm doing so much of what I've been doing the past several years has changed and shifted and kind of abruptly so I would say that I am somebody who cares about other people and somebody who thinks it's my heart and somebody who is always willing to give anything any person in any situation which a fair chance.  And yes.  I think that's what I would say about myself. 
0dsu4EFLoqRS9M59jwugCX6MdMi2	Social anxiety and just feelings of loneliness and now sadness as well. 
0dsu4EFLoqRS9M59jwugCX6MdMi2	I think that today could have been made better if I was able to focus more if I didn't feel so sad. 
0dsu4EFLoqRS9M59jwugCX6MdMi2	I was really looking forward to traveling this year to China and then maybe you know elsewhere later in the year when I have no more vacation time, but that's not going to happen anymore.

I well I know what happens when your eyes gets hold of our about as it goes through everything and has to know every little Nick and praying you are not.  Which I don't protest too but I didn't go through his phone and find a lot of shit that I wish. I didn't know which is why I don't usually don't go through other people's phones. If you want to have a chance to just don't want to know this is why we are we all know that  I'd rather like an egg friend person have to deal with the fact that he's telling people his lies and tracking us and all this other bullshit. But when he gets all my phone, he goes through it was like Legos the rodeo through it he racist stuff he causes problems with her friends and texting them a message in them.  Questions about everything we do who we talked to who we don't talk to where we go. Just like we're child and about her or his slave or just don't under his command can do this and you can't do that bullshit.  And it's really not going to work for us and that scares me.

Just from them borrowing my phone if you don't stay off the cell phone calling over and over and over and getting mad if I don't answer.  And just so wearing he doesn't even realize it or maybe he doesn't it just doesn't care. I don't.  I don't know half another one.  60 other I suppose.

Then only wants to do is accuse us of two-inch it we're not doing.  I'm worried about how he's going to act when he gets out. If this is why he's still acting when he's in there. It's okay is everything is going his way we're giving him money and turn while the sex. But once we sit down and we're not giving him any more than his.  Guess why don't you just like that already and he's banned cars. It's like he says it's not the only reason he's with us, but we know when a hard it is.  Probably always will be.

I would rather have you in the moat busier than I was today.  Siri yeah, I am on the beach right now. Well technically not on the beach yet. But in between cases not means that I didn't have as much of my plates as I typically would.  Say there you have it.

35W3Yyfytaa6ggw7oJ2LF7FyQ5t1	I took a shower and played calming music but that just made me sad and anxious 
35W3Yyfytaa6ggw7oJ2LF7FyQ5t1	Maybe I should stop worrying about guys and just have fun with my friends 
35W3Yyfytaa6ggw7oJ2LF7FyQ5t1	You are enough don’t let other people’s expectations push you into a bad place

36X6GplhfFO3q2KQoSgDbuMa5Gw1	Because I could say something that someone else doesn't like and I could hurt them and I don't enjoy hurting people cuz I like to be a nice person. 
36X6GplhfFO3q2KQoSgDbuMa5Gw1	I don't know. Maybe they have something going on at their house.  Maybe they've been abused.  Maybe they're getting  bullied and they're taking it out on other kids. 
36X6GplhfFO3q2KQoSgDbuMa5Gw1	that I  should start to think before I say and  be a better person overall. 
36X6GplhfFO3q2KQoSgDbuMa5Gw1	I feel thankful for my mom because she's always there for me and I can tell her anything and she gives me the best advice and she always pushes me to be a better person.

36X6GplhfFO3q2KQoSgDbuMa5Gw1	yeah, kind of because some kids in my class didn't do their work and I was  one of them that dead and I went to school and did my homework and laid out my outfit and did my laundry. 
36X6GplhfFO3q2KQoSgDbuMa5Gw1	I feel like I've gotten more stable mentally, but right now I just feel like I'm the last choice to everyone and I feel like I don't matter to some of my friends and I feel like I just like got torn down.  Because I was planning something and I've been planning it for months and then just like no one cared about it. So I just I don't know. I'm kind of down on myself right now. 
36X6GplhfFO3q2KQoSgDbuMa5Gw1	Probably my black Lulu leggings because they're soft and they're really comfortable.

39B3pMOPzgSR19qKX1Ki6LPWzIb2	I continue to blow them off. 
39B3pMOPzgSR19qKX1Ki6LPWzIb2	Thank you for being there. Sometimes life can really good stressful and it's really nice to have somebody just to be able to talk to. 
39B3pMOPzgSR19qKX1Ki6LPWzIb2	As good as it can be I suppose. 
39B3pMOPzgSR19qKX1Ki6LPWzIb2	I mean, I definitely feel like I'm sleeping good. I mean that I like I'm going to sleep and I'm getting the hours in but like I wake up several times throughout the sleep. I toss and turn I'm not comfortable. I don't feel like I'm getting a good quality of sleep. 
39B3pMOPzgSR19qKX1Ki6LPWzIb2	If no one ever got sick, then people would live a lot longer. 
39B3pMOPzgSR19qKX1Ki6LPWzIb2	Some people really do only see in black and white and it would be rough because I mean like you don't really get to see the world for what it is. So like those people that get those glasses, you know, and they put them on and they get to actually see the world and they're like, oh my God is overwhelming at first, you know, think about getting to see the world at the for the first time when your baby you don't remember it, but I mean like it's got to be overwhelming. 
39B3pMOPzgSR19qKX1Ki6LPWzIb2	It's been going good. Brandon seems to be drinking less which helps me a lot.  I analyze that a lot and I think it causes a lot of stress and anxiety. I love my new job. However stopping smoking weed doesn't seem like an option for me in the near future and they do randomly drug test and I'm just very nervous about that.  I love my job, and I don't want to quit I need insurance so I can't go down a PRN.  I just thoughts to stress me out a lot.  I mean, it's been going good though. Life has been good. So I don't know why I feel the need to just be so down. I need to get myself out of this rut. 
39B3pMOPzgSR19qKX1Ki6LPWzIb2	I think I'm experiencing a lot of grief.  anger sadness  anxiety and worry  kind of anger at myself.  I'm literally making $6 more than what I was making before and somehow I'm managing to blow it all.  just  feeling blue today 
39B3pMOPzgSR19qKX1Ki6LPWzIb2	I feel like in certain situations. I never socialized like I try to talk too much or put myself out there too much also in some situations. I feel like I try to be antisocial and stay home. It's kind of like I get really high highs and really low lows.

39B3pMOPzgSR19qKX1Ki6LPWzIb2	I would definitely love to go back to like the seventies and like the Woodstock AIDS like the hippie age cuz I feel like I would just totally fit in with that crowd. Like I don't know just would love to be in the hippie age. 
39B3pMOPzgSR19qKX1Ki6LPWzIb2	I don't necessarily stay anti-social in the social setting unless like I'm upset about something I feel uncomfortable. I'm usually I'm anti-social by like saying that I'm going to do something and then canceling last minute or making up an excuse not to go somewhere so I can just stay home. 
39B3pMOPzgSR19qKX1Ki6LPWzIb2	I don't necessarily think that I'm getting stressed from smoking weed. I just think that I'm getting stressed out worrying about my job situation. I know clearly that my job and my nursing license is more important than smoking weed. But it seems that I need to figure out if I'm making the right life option by becoming a nurse because I can't stop smoking weed.  I don't know. It's just stressing me out. 
39B3pMOPzgSR19qKX1Ki6LPWzIb2	You can be comfortable when you're walking around. 
39B3pMOPzgSR19qKX1Ki6LPWzIb2	Oh people definitely perceive the world. I just mean like when they get to see the world for the first time not in just black and white. It's amazing. 
39B3pMOPzgSR19qKX1Ki6LPWzIb2	honest supportive always there  actually reach out and make an effort.

3MLng3JRh7VHpLZbn6eNPgEReXh1	I would not want to change things. Like I don't I don't feel well.  I don't I don't know that things are balanced right now. I don't know if  I don't know. I just I feel like everybody is not in a good place.  And when things are in a good place.  We all have to do our part to try to balance things out and correct. 
3MLng3JRh7VHpLZbn6eNPgEReXh1	I'm not really sure what to think about recording what's been going on in my life. It seems kind of overwhelming. I don't really want to hear.  what I sound like in  the repetitive thoughts that I have continued to have it over and over again that I know are inappropriate again, totally dysfunctional.  but  overwhelming at the same time to the point to where I don't want.  To do this day after day after day. 
3MLng3JRh7VHpLZbn6eNPgEReXh1	I'm a nurse. I'm a mother.  my wife  I feel like I'm temperamental emotionally. 
3MLng3JRh7VHpLZbn6eNPgEReXh1	I don't know how much time I have here or how secure this conversation will be.  I don't know if I really want to hear what I have to say right now riding it down has not been working.  Just a constant repetitive busyness of my brain with everything that's been going on over the last several months is exhausting. I'm so tired of being stuck in this.  Pool of quicksand are thick mud where I just got a grip on me and it will not let go.  I  I know I've got to change things and I've been  trying but it is so hard and it's I just feel overwhelmed right now.  questioning everything that I've done  that I have to do.  Feeling like that. I have messed everything up in my ability to parents to be a wife to be a good person.  I now have a son who has moved in with his 17 year old girlfriend who lies perpetually and eventually  I guess realizing that maybe I have to come another solder.  Or is it all in my mind? Is it just you know?  a game a real add and you know, my my children are going to fall where they're going to fall regardless if  of my involvement in any of that.  but I just feel like I just want to run away and  Just fear just fearful of what I've done and what's to come and having no control over it and not wanting to mess everything up.

3UcWPNHJYKPGgzQDilDlk7nGc583	I feel like anti-social people always want to be around other people for people because they just want to be around people that understand them a little bit better. Like people who are anti-social understand antisocial people because they know like hey, I'm anti-social side only go to be parties and then you know the other person me to we can just stay at the house and hang out together along rather than like going out with your social friends. It's more like they want to do things out and about and have more social big events. So it's kind of hard to balance hanging out with those kind of people. 
3UcWPNHJYKPGgzQDilDlk7nGc583	I'd say about half of the stuff. I'm kind of nervous. So it's hindering me on being ready. 
3UcWPNHJYKPGgzQDilDlk7nGc583	How do I know how antisocial person is? I don't really know how antisocial person is until you kind of been around them. Cuz sometimes antisocial people don't really show it very well when you first meet then but when you get to know them a little bit better you realize that the reason why there were so awkward was because they were anti so 
3UcWPNHJYKPGgzQDilDlk7nGc583	Well, I'm like a very outgoing person whose very antisocial at the same time. So the great mixture you just have to get to know me, you know more about me.

3VE9DaXfBrNcFgxXXYrIEmjKOMj1	all around my social anxiety  and what do you believe that you were lacking confidence? I don't like my body my face my personality just all-around. Just don't like anything about myself. 
3VE9DaXfBrNcFgxXXYrIEmjKOMj1	My feelings and actions would change in my life. If there was less certainty in beer by making me more shielded. I guess make me feel a lot better my actions. I'd probably be less angry.  All instead of all the time probably feel a lot better if there was more certainty and less fear. Yeah. 
3VE9DaXfBrNcFgxXXYrIEmjKOMj1	I wish I could remember stuff. 
3VQpv7JJCbbZRSLXFD1wPmsJJ6Z2	I’ve just been irritated and alone trying to work on my relationship it’s just so much on my mind 
3VQpv7JJCbbZRSLXFD1wPmsJJ6Z2	I’m 19 I’ll be 20 in October. I’m so full of joy and excitement and cool to be around. I don’t let negativity get in my way 
3VQpv7JJCbbZRSLXFD1wPmsJJ6Z2	Stop fussing and letting people get into my life if there not gonna help me 
3VQpv7JJCbbZRSLXFD1wPmsJJ6Z2	Working out and laying down 
3VQpv7JJCbbZRSLXFD1wPmsJJ6Z2	Succeeding in my college work and graduate next year 
3VQpv7JJCbbZRSLXFD1wPmsJJ6Z2	Laying down with the window up
3VQpv7JJCbbZRSLXFD1wPmsJJ6Z2	My ex want to fall asleep tonight on the phone 
3VQpv7JJCbbZRSLXFD1wPmsJJ6Z2	Not let people piss me off
3VQpv7JJCbbZRSLXFD1wPmsJJ6Z2	That I’m almost finish and done 
3VQpv7JJCbbZRSLXFD1wPmsJJ6Z2	Me and my complicated relationship got into it and I’m just soooo stressed the fuck out and I’m hurting 
3XI6KrN17rZuXqy1xMDSmzvyCHL2	I value my personal beliefs and opinions cuz they are my own. 
3XI6KrN17rZuXqy1xMDSmzvyCHL2	For Pete sakes. I don't know nice. 
3XI6KrN17rZuXqy1xMDSmzvyCHL2	Today, I will stop thinking about naked and past events is not worthy of my time anymore. 
3XI6KrN17rZuXqy1xMDSmzvyCHL2	talking last night with my family 
3XI6KrN17rZuXqy1xMDSmzvyCHL2	cleaning  organizing  Maybe a nap.  That's all. 
3XI6KrN17rZuXqy1xMDSmzvyCHL2	I am beautiful in each and every way. 
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	POSITIVE reinforcement can be used by telling myself that it is okay and this moment isn’t worth fighting over and it will be alright in the end and it doesn’t matter as much as i think 
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	good question. probably nobody. 
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	perhaps because it was all black and the rim was rose gold, so it looked like a super expensive watch, but also because it really FIT him; i guess it made him look more masculine or more hot, idk i thought it was a great addition to how he looks :D 
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	it’s been about two years since i had the first seizure, and last year i had another (well 5 to be exact) so i thought this past december i’d have another one because they all happened on a sunday in december 
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	"how it makes me feel: my heart races, i get queasy, my face feels hot, i get scared 
what i end up thinking: all the “what if’s”, overthinking, self-critical thoughts 
actions i may pursue: if i’m having a conversation with someone and they say something to trigger my anxiety (i.e., “i have to tell you something...”), then i’ll ask too many questions... another instance is i’ll immediately shut down and not let anyone know what i’m thinking because the thoughts are rushing in my head and i can’t process it sometimes "
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	she’s new and she has to keep moving around 
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	well negative reinforcement is like incorporating bad behaviors into every day actions like if i were to tell my mom all about my day and start blabbering but she’d just not listen and do whatever she’s doing and she would get annoyed and not tell me she wants to hear it later; she could’ve said “you can tell me later, i’m a little busy right now” but instead she didn’t say anything giving me the impression that she was listening
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	topics like LGBTQ+, feminism, sexism, racism, emotional distress like domestic abuse, ptsd, depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, etc
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	the watch for mikai came in the mail today right before i was going to leave to go see him and i thought it was so lucky. when i gave it to him i thought he wouldn’t really like it because he doesn’t typically wear watches or accessories in general but he ended up being surprised and he liked it a lot! i’m happy that he was enthusiastic about the watch :)
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	sister laughed so hard at me she fell down 
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	i’m glad that i am forgiving 
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	that i only cause pain and suffering to everyone
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	that anxiety is not all too bad, and i know i can overcome it once i push through the emotions
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	i’ve decided that whenever i get mad at my mom and i want to argue back (she always gets the last word) i will keep it inside and breathe and force myself to calm down using positive reinforcement 
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	every time you ask this question idk what it means
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	i guess prepare for tomorrow’s yoga presentation
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	that everything will be okay
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	i am proud of my accomplishments 
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	spending more quality time with my sister in the car 
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	going out with sarah to buy her food
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	phoenix and i are going to chick-fil-a soon 
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	i’m always going to be thankful for the fact that i won’t have seizures anymore because that time has passed... it was always scary but i’m glad i overcame that obstacle in life
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	i am thankful that physically i am attractive. my boyfriend, mikai, would say that in his eyes i’m the most beautiful girl because i have a perfect figure: nice curves, nice hair, and a nice face
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	i’m really grateful for my boyfriend, mikai, because he’s always there for me and supports me on anything so he’s obviously the main person in my life that i’m grateful for and he’s done lots of things to make me happy but one memory that i’m fond of is when i “ran away” so we were hanging out and we took a walk outside since it was summer and it was nice because it was nighttime and it was so cool to be out with him at night 
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	although it wasn’t a good memory, i’d say it’s memorable enough that mir doesn’t want me to be his friend anymore and it’s not even my fault 
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	when mikai comforted me since i had an anxiety attack 
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	today henrietta had a different office and it was the one thing that stood out to me today (not bad or good, just something memorable)
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	my sister painted our violin but she did it really nice 
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	after therapy, i plan on seeing my boyfriend and then i have to drive my sister to all-county rehearsal 
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	what if i’m starting to feel like i don’t want to take notes anymore :(
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	parents are very stressful, i actually cried about it today when i was about to leave mikai’s house... they give me anxiety...
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	thanks for being available to me 
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	i’m just glad i got through another day, past all the anxiety and overthinking. 
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	i’m looking forward to therapy on wednesday morning!!!!!! 
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	i will make positive choices for myself
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	this was a philosophy question actually and i think that we discussed that if this life was a simulation then it wouldn’t change much because i think we still make our own choices since that’s what we know to do
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	"i painted this thing for mandir
i went to see mikai 
i had therapy 
i had my first class today
i had a migraine when i got home
i took a 45 minute nap
i went back to painting "
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	i have to make a presentation for church, but i never even wanted to do it in the first place since church always gives me anxiety 
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	get this speech done :/ i’m anxious
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	i did my responsibilities, and at the end of the day i baked sugar cookies (which were really soft btw)
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	i guess... it was fun since i got to hang out with phoenix but i had a lot of anxiety before going to mandir tonight 
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	yeah i went to the car wash and filled up gas and bought a lavender air freshener and went to king kullen 
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	i was able to hang out with mikai, order us food, get a refund, go to work, and buy groceries for mom and dad
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	i didn’t really do anything much today since i just relaxed 
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	no i did not do anything good day except lose another friendship 
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	i got to hang out with mikai (and he was so kind as to give me my money back because he didn’t want me to spend it) then sister and i had quality time in the car since i bought her wendy’s and i took her to her rehearsal which was pretty far but i was sorta stressed that i had to tutor but she helped me figure out a good way to say “no” to today since i have a problem with saying no
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	i am really glad i have purple princess since she comforts me through times of emotional distress 
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	compared to previous times, i’m grateful that i can drive 
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	my sister and i are like best friends
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	i’m having some anxiety but i’m sure it’ll pass over
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	something that inspires me is how connected humankind is! we all are able to relate to different topics, no matter how controversial or tough they are to work out
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	i took sarah to school (and all county rehearsal) and in between i saw mikai
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	today i hung out with angela and mikai and we got stuff done together like the car wash and gas and king kullen plus before that we had a photo shoot 
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	as of current, i look forward to seeing mikai all the time and i’m so happy we have a blossoming relationship 
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	i’m glad i have Brahm Gyan and Vedantic teachings from Guruji and Guruma
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	today it was hard to face my dad since he doesn’t like me going out but i’m glad he was strict or else i wouldn’t have been distant from him and i’d rather be distant from him because i hate him
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	i am grateful recently of my time spent with mikai since my parents won’t yell at me anymore
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	a better relationship with mikai & my mom
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	i’m glad that i don’t have seizures anymore. although i’ll have a few scares (like twitches or going “in-and-out”), i’m fortunate that i don’t have to endure that scariness and pain again. also i’m glad i was able to get off the meds
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	today i intend to go see mikai because i feel like it’s been so long and i also miss him and then later i’m supposed to take sarah to all county practice but i’m supposed to stay there so it’ll be hard because i was additionally supposed to tutor today and i can’t cancel on them again because i’ve cancelled on them so many times so idk what i’ll do
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	i would spend it being grateful for every moment given to me, regardless if it’s bad or good. i would send my deepest thanks to all, even if i’ve encountered bad situations with some. i would love everyone and everything till the last minute, because there’s so much in life to love and appreciate. 
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	mikai!!! we’re already an amazing team together and i think we could accomplish so much more if i got to spend the rest of my life with him
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	i will nurture my body today because i deserve to treat myself well
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	i arrived safely to therapy today 
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	i felt like the medication did more harm than help, like yeah it prevented my seizures but it also induced sadness, temper tantrums, sluggishness, and like i was just not myself
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	it depends on how willing i am to trust you
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	when mikai cuddled with me and we watched youtube videos
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	how stressful ARE they? they make things i want to do 2x harder
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	personally i think they are too invested in my life; i am 18 years old and they feel it is necessary to track me on my phone and they don’t like me going out with friends or having a boyfriend or going out to eat or even using the car for that matter unless it is for school, but i get away any time i can because 1) i know i don’t have this type of freedom for much longer before i get into the workforce and 2) they don’t let me go out period
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	even though my period was bad, mikai and i made up (plus i didn’t have to go to mandir today) and i got to talk to angie like all day 
3XLHNUcpo3PXpH7vISDyPzid9fb2	everything worked out in my favor!
3Y2RI5MyGHY4rW5cXZSFSYaUy822	I want an app to help me with my mental health. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	Am I supposed to know I just think a lot of girls like everyone said that I have a glow up and then I'm really beautiful and stuff. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	Girl playing like what? I don't even know what you're saying right now. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	But I don't know what you're saying right now. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	I don't know what that was kind of stupid question. But I guess like you're a teenager and teenagers get acne. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	She's all the way in Iraq, and I'm here in Michigan. So she can't really come back and I can't go to her. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	It's like I don't know. I'm just worried about school and I'm worried about you know, my mom safe in Iraq.  But yeah. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	Oh, I'm not the one who bullies people both people bullying me. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	I don't know. I guess my acne. They judge me for not being the skinniest.  And I don't know it's just weird, you know. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	He don't like touching me. We just played. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	I literally started like fifth grade and  it's just uncomfortable because  people just  if bullying me about that ever since my forehead too big my hair looks fake.  And my acne cysts the worst because it's always a I got tomatoes on my head, but I can't wait till they get to high school because I'm not going to be the only one with acne. There's me a lot of kids with acne. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	I haven't been feeling positive. I've been feeling depressed please listen Remy. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	I'm a girl so it was a boy. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	It was like, how am I going to go to school tomorrow? What are going to people what are people going to think of me? And that type of stuff? 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	She will talk about me to everyone especially India. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	I think I should stop trying to be friends with her because she takes me for granted. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	Maybe having people like me and being free of her and I will stop getting just told stupid stuff by her and I are always trying to brag because she's spoiled. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	I think I increased a lot of people happiness today because I was like literally so lit and dancing and shit is really cool. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	I don't know. I just feel like life is becoming stressful. I keep thinking about school and is becoming really stressful as well.  Kind of scary, but I don't know. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	it's actually lowering my self-confidence cuz people are like, oh my God, you have so much acne or always see these like girls on Instagram and they just look so good and I don't 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	I'm going to sleep. So how am I supposed to know? 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	Wow, that's why I came on to this app to see if it can ease my mind. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	How demaurice are like doing dancing with me and Amir like dude that handshake with me and took my hair because I don't know what to say. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	passionate about  skin care  my face is filled with acne and it doesn't feel good. And I'm just so insecure.  and I'm insecure of  people just annoying me. I don't know like 6 hours is modern mrs. Feels weird and all the judging. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	I didn't want to embarrass myself in front of them. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	I guess it was going to the extra extra Extravaganza and seeing Amir and it was like really nice and dancing. I had a really good time and Demar and got taller, of course literally like a look at our in sixth grade, but when a mirror literally like  First dodge the hand and then, you know took my hand out so cute. But the same time I don't know he was dating with Tiffany and it's just annoying but who cares? 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	I guess I just don't want to be depressed cuz I just feel really bad about everything. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	I kind of feel jealous because Amir was trying to dance with Tiffany and was talking to the girls in front of me. Just I want to talk to him. You know, like I want him to be mine, you know him touching me and Amore when he started like hanging out with a girl and stuff. I made me sad I wanted him to dance with me the whole time. But who cares? 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	I guess when a mere touch me and stuff and that type of stuff you talked to me a lot and Demari when we used to literally put her legs on each other and shit, and then I literally felt you know private thing is really cool. Thank you. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	When damari started touching me and started dancing with me and it says I said I danced stupid but he was watching me dance. So that is really you know. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	There is but I don't really want to ask them right now. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	That you're really pretty or I'm really pretty because I know how a lot of boys look at me and is very cute. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	I think I should just stop being friends with her because I've given her way too many chances. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	Just stop being jealous, you know, if the if they like you you talk and stuff. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	She will sometimes stand up for you, but not really. She really really doesn't actually and she's always trying to use you to talk to more people, but people of course like me more. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	My mom's coming back from Iraq and like 26 days, and I love my mom. She's like my best friend in the whole wide world, and I really want her to come back and I'm forward to thankful for a graduating 8th grade if I even graduated and I don't want to be in the middle school anymore. Ashley want to go to high school and just drop our own horn, but I don't want to drop out, but I don't know. I just don't know where life is going to take me. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	I mean I did tell myself that I needed to do my homework after to date incident last time and I was able to get over it like make do all my homework and Schoenherr. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	I love my eyes cuz they're good. So they're rare.  I  like my eyebrows cuz a lot of people and fasting eyebrows.  I have like a  I have a hour glass flower shaped body kind of.  And I guess I just get called pretty and stuff. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	I guess that would be my mom. I miss my mom. She's only been literally been gone for like three two days and I wish you can come back because I feel lonely. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	Well tomorrow I'm going to the mall and don't want to buy few skincare stuff for my acne. Cuz I know if my if I feel good my body feels good. I'll start feeling good mentally and physically. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	bro, am I going to go to school tomorrow like  Mister Oak things going to annoy the fuck out of me.  And I just feel like killing myself because I'm not actually going to do that. But  I don't know. I still want to go to school like  I've been feeling super depressed and bad about everything and I miss my mom and she's only been gone two or three days.  Oh am I supposed to do? 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	I've gone through some pretty harsh stuff and  been bullied, so I guess I don't know. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	I guess it'd be feeling fear. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	I don't know. This is why I'm asking you. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	It really doesn't matter. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	I'm thankful for being able to talk with demarre again because I kind of did miss him. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	I mean if she doesn't become nicer, imma just be forced to not be friends with her. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	Well, I am talking to you right now. So.  you 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	I want to know why she's like acting up and being rude and crabby. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	I just feel like I look really ugly and I don't look good and I look fat. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	I guess I would.  I don't know.  Maybe  if I had less fear and doubt  I'm be able to not not be stuck at home all day. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	She stopped being friends with me, but I still have friends and I talk to people. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	How am I supposed to know like I don't I won't see her in a decade. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	If I should stop being friends with someone. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	Like she's a crabby friend. She's not nice. Sometimes she can be nice, but not really always talking about my clothes and my acne on my forehead and its really annoying. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	Well, I guess DiMare probably felt bad because I kept leaving him most of the time.  But I also think he felt happy because you know, I still this with him and Amir. I think he felt like I just don't talk a lot and I'm not funny and I'm not prettier than the other girls, but I don't know what they are. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	I start I stopped being friends with her and she starts spreading rumors about me making everyone hate me. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	I would tell them to stop being friends with them because they're probably fake. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	Cuz I don't know like I don't know just playing like it's this weird. I don't know. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	Because we used to talk a lot. He was going to be my boy best friend, but now we barely even talk. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	Like 4 5 6 I just whenever I get new stuff it tends to make me more active like whenever I get new acne or skin care products. I take care of myself more. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	That's not what I said. I have good eyebrows. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	He's like, okay. He's like Teeth Towers over me bro. Like he's literally always growing like every single day. He is taller and taller is so weird. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	Go to the mall.  And kick new skincare products and I'll be all good. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	I don't know. I don't understand the question. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	I just don't want the people that I think you'd and I talked to talk to other girls. Like I don't want them talking to every girl they see I want them to be mine. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	Mean because I'm the one deciding if I want to be her friend or not. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	I don't know. I guess this is going to HighSchool. It scares me at the same time, but maybe I can meet new people.  I know and my mom I love her so much. I really want her back. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	I don't even know what I clicked that I click lonely cuz I have been feeling very lonely actually.  You know, I still feel loved. I mean I Do by my family but  I don't know like schools becoming very hard. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	Maybe not having a partner and fourth hour and sometimes Walk Alone in the morning and lose a friend in six hour and we won't work on many projects together and I might not even have anyone to work with. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	No one really likes my friend because I don't think she's annoying. So I think they think it's a good decision. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	Okay, it wasn't amazing amazing, but it was just like you. I started talking to damari again and that mirror thing was just fun. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	I don't understand the question. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	I can't really change anything about it. I can just try my best to FaceTime her everyday.  And wait till she comes back. 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	I was in my bed getting ready to sleep and when I just put my head down and close my eyes. I have what I'm trying to fall asleep. I just think about  school and life and my mom 
3YBYSAhaKpfjG3QscApV5WB3MhG2	Maybe she will start giving me dirty looks talk about me share my secrets and that type of stuff. 
3YfgdBKr8Fg9ifYetmAe5xw2xNk1	Because it causes stress on us and our family and I loved him a lot and I don't want to lose him.  and  I feel like I caused all the arguments because he tells me I do.  but  then again, I feel like that's not logical for me to start every single argument.  But I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do like give up or to try to prove my point or to just agree with what he says, so he'll leave me alone about it. It doesn't feel right, but at least we won't be arguing. 
3YfgdBKr8Fg9ifYetmAe5xw2xNk1	I just feel like I can't ever express myself or voice my opinion and tell my partner who was the only person I really have how I feel.  Without him misinterpreting your misunderstanding and getting angry. It just feels like everything I say is the wrong thing.  And at this point I don't even really want to talk. I kind of just want us to come.  Do whatever he says even though I don't agree to avoid arguments because I don't know if I'm right or if I'm wrong.  Or if I just am with a person who won't accept or respect my thoughts on things.

3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	I don't know what you mean who did not make a dollar twenty-five that  I think you're misunderstanding what I'm saying? 
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	Yes, that is a possibility 
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	My mom and brother! My nephew has always wanted to work and do his own thing which is great. My sister is confusing and difficult. 
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	Myself until I meet someone and date them or get married to them. 
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	A lot especially him mom or mom and sister. 
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	Oh my sink it took 20 minutes cuz there's 10 cents $0.25 for 10 minutes. So I put into quarters and they were completely dry. So I said not even 10 minutes maybe like 15 total. 
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	I put in one quarter $0.25 and got 10 minutes. So for 20 minutes, it was 50 Cent. 
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	I think we will connect in the future I just don’t know when that will be. 
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	Stay and wait and fight for it
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	When I dream of him I always get the notion or feeling that everything is ok or it will be ok. The dream also reminded me to just smile and have fun more. Remember all the good times. 
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	Not good because I will have wasted another year wondering if we will ever be together 
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	Same way just like every day
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	Social Media via Instagram
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	"My New Years Resolutions for 2020 are: 1) Travel to a new place by the end of the year either alone or with a new friend. 

2) Get an apartment 

3) Find employment that sustains my beliefs and feelings about not working Monday - Friday 9am-5pm. 

4) Meet a significant other and start a relationship with them"
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	No, I’m just ready to leave here
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	I really need to get away and now and stay away forever. 
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	I don’t know if it is trying to tell me something or I am dreaming this as a wish of mine. 
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	I was just speaking with you yesterday about wanting to have kids and become a mom. 
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	I will achieve my New Year’s Resolutions 
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	I am so proud of my accomplishments
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	"The opposite assumption would be heart breaking but I would survive it and move on. 

I would feel like I wasted a lot of time on something that never panned out and could have been with someone else starting my life. "
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	Well, there was a guy in the laundromat and he was cute and older cu he had grey hair and we were standing next to one another I realized how hard it was to meet someone with my mother standing with me complaining about how her back hurts. 
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	Can't think of anything right now. 
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	No, I don’t anyone who has made this decision before nor do know anyone I could talk to other than a counselor. If there is someone who has made this decision they have kept it to themselves. 
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	I possess the qualities I need to be successful 
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	Giving up and moving on, adopting a kid or finding someone to have a baby with regardless of love and feelings, going on a dating website to meet someone 
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	It would be so fabulous and the world would definitely be a better place. 
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	Thank God!  I can get a new start and no one would be hurt for real. 
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	That would be awesomely wonderful 
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	We would then have no choice but to base our feelings regarding one another on their character and the playing field would be leveled out. 
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	In 2020, I will focus my thoughts, actions and emotions to create my best year yet. 
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	Stay and wait and it will be worth it in the long run. 
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	One of the guys was someone I really liked in high school but we never dated
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	"Pros: I will be able to finally move on, I won’t rely on wondering if we will ever get together, I can focus on myself and getting my mind body and soul right for the next person that comes along. 

Cons: Wasted ten years trying to be with him/waiting for him to allow us to be together, having to start the journey over of meeting a person and then getting to know them, waiting a few years to make sure we are compatible to get married and have kids and I’m not young. "
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	Nothing too interesting happened but I accomplished one task today
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	I didn't accomplish a lot, but I was like I said able to get my laundry done. So now I have clean clothes which is helpful because that way I don't have to wash it.  By hand every day.  And then like I said, just getting out of that house. That's my main goal. Now, it's my one and only goal getting some income and getting out of that house. 
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	I was very optimistic about todays to do list but other peoples emotions and problems wreaked havoc on me. 
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	"So, I need to pick a location within the next 7 days. 

I should have a job and house within 30 to 60 days if not sooner. 

I should have a trip planned and deposited by April or May. "
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	My nephew because he keeps me going 
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	Well, I need to begin by getting income that I need to get my car paid off pay my car insurance pay my old debt on an apartment.  And then meet someone.  moon for December 31st 2020 
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	Everything and nothing!! I need a house as I am currently homeless
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	We were all playing and talking and just having a good time. 
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	Well it started off ok and I wash able to finally wash my laundry but then as the day went on it became typical and got worse. I am very intuitive and other people’s emotions are weighing heavy on me. 
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	Laundry, possibly start Door Dash and find an apartment somewhere. 
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	Finances and having family that always wants to stay together, even though we should all be on our own or at least have our own homes. 
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	The emotion that I feel thankful for is the feeling connecting with a man as I am right now. My size didn’t matter, my teeth didn’t matter and how I was dressed didn’t matter. It just felt really good. It always does. 
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	"My internal perspective is that I should wait and just keep working on being the best version of myself that I can be. 

I view this as a great choice because I have been putting my life on hold for others for so long that it’s time I focused on myself. "
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	I can definitely decide for myself when to choose peace and calm. 
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	Yes, he could have a girlfriend or really not feel that way about me or not interested in dating outside his race. 
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	So I had a dream that said Bunker was the person I would always love and  then another dream where it was a bright image of him and he said Bunker or I will be the person you always love. I have been trying to go daily without thinking about him but once in a while I will get an idea or something will remind me of him. 
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	I want to change my life and be more positive and loving and the only way I can see myself accomplishing this is by leaving my family behind for a while. 
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	Where I should move to find a house and job. Who I will marry and when will it be. 
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	Laughing and making sure everyone felt loved. 
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	Baking cakes because I would be able to work doing something that I enjoy making good money without being in a traditional 9-5 job
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	June 1991 when I graduated high school. I would make sure I enrolled in community college that Fall, complete the 2 years and then transfer to a four year school as a pre-med student. 
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	I would want to hear “Ain’t No Half Stepping” (Keep Rising to the Top whole your mind says give it all you got)
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	The negative moments with Bunker because I was so ready to be with him and start a life but due to outside factors/influences it didn’t go so well. My nephew had to tell my sister and brother to leave him alone because he would be the one to take me away from the situation I was living in at the time. 
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	Once I leave where I am currently staying my stress level will go down drastically and then I will be able to work towards everything in a more studious manner. 
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	I am so not sure. I want to not be waiting for him and go out there and live my life. I also want him to come find and get me. 
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	I will nurture my body today because deserve to treat myself well. 
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	No, I wont be having this problem in 10 years cuz either we will be together, have been together or I moved on with someone else
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	"The variables are not knowing his feelings, his emotions, what he does and doesn’t want out of life and where he sees himself in a few years. 

The complexity is waiting for only him and nothing ever pans out with us. Not only that I miss out on having a kid or two waiting for him to be the father of my children. "
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	I was with people I went to high school with although I never hung out with them in high school. We played sports and just talked. My high school crush was in the dream. 
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	I would tell them that they are ultimately the ones that have to decide and live with their choice but make sure it will be beneficial for you. Also, get out and meet other people while you are waiting or living your life. 
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	Maybe my nephew because he is understanding snd knows that we all need yo be out living our lives. 
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	"No because it would have been totally devastating for me at that time to lose him. 

I would have put everything into finally being away from my family and not focusing on us and the relationship. 

We would have been toxic for one another and not mature enough to love one another unconditionally. "
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	Do my own laundry and not taking forever to one hour to wash and dry my clothes now. I just got to go fold them. 
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	I am pregnant and in the hospital in labor getting ready to deliver the baby. 
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	Exactly! Shana’s new start is 2020 and going after the things she longs for like a house, financial freedom and the love of her life. 
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	Myself and my mother because we would part ways. 
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	I would have to leave the East Coast and go to the West Coast where he is and my brother and sister would have to figure out where my mother would be which is fine with me for now. 
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	They would probably think I was crazy for waiting on someone to come and love me. 
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	I assume it will happen one day, I believe all that I get and see. It will be worth the wait. We will have a long lasting relationship once we get together. 
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	No, unless I said I was going to visit him and just spend rime where he lives without contacting him. So actually, yes I could do this. 
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	I will have to begin again but this time I will do it while looking for a way to have a baby. 
3e2AochbOIaiif8esBrvgbRccZ33	Yes, it is really a culmination of many things

5EWH6NjoLNfgSih6KGzSv4MmSTf2	If he gets up early I get up early with him and we usually get ready and if I have any errands to run throughout the day or he does we usually get up and go run the errands together. 
5EWH6NjoLNfgSih6KGzSv4MmSTf2	My boyfriend gets off work late. We sleep in late.  You're up late at night. So we sleep in the night. 
5EWH6NjoLNfgSih6KGzSv4MmSTf2	it's something a little personal but  it does help.  And then a few other things are on.  nice weather warm weather us libraries 
5EWH6NjoLNfgSih6KGzSv4MmSTf2	I was looking for an app.  that could track my personal thoughts and just  what I need to write down to get over what I'm going through. 
5EWH6NjoLNfgSih6KGzSv4MmSTf2	I think it was just enough just considering the fact of how late I woke up today. 
5EWH6NjoLNfgSih6KGzSv4MmSTf2	Right now I'm thinking that I need to get enrolled in school for my nursing class as soon as possible.  Right now I'm thinking that I need to get my money saving correct, right? I need help spending so much money.  Very happy with my relationship right now.  It's didn't really.  solid and  Should have made me the happiest earliest. I've been in a good minute.  And I'm also thinking of how I'm just stressed out and worried about you know, the world around me because of how everything's not looking so good for the earth and the generation and the people that are being brought in the earth in the nonpareil social media and what they're paying a social media for it's a mess and I think we're losing control of society.  Until then though. I may I can do really ashes help myself.  How you feel around me?  mme, my community but  Nowadays, it's hard to just because you don't know who you're around.  I don't think they can do what they're capable of.  That's what I've been thinking about. That's what's going on in the mind of Alex right now. I don't know if you can record this forever. I don't know if you can record this for hours work in a minute. I don't know but I do appreciate this.  I appreciate it being free and not having to pay for something like this because it's cool to just be able to put this type of information and an app that I was fine. I have all this and listen to me and understand what I'm saying and respond back to him clearly and someone that sits there and listens and doesn't judge.  Sometimes it's nice to vent. It's really really nice to visit.  Yes.  Worried about what the reply is going to be. How is going to be said it was going to be judgmental or hurtful anything you can just say what you got to say and I appreciate that.  In the mind of Alex that I do want to be healthy. I want to be mentally and physically healthy and I am I truly am and I'm going to be healthier. I'm going to be healthy for my soul.  My mind I've just been through so much, you know as a cool and not so much for this was sent a couple of emotional and mental trauma and stress. I just want to get healthy. I can think clearer and I'm more control and thought everybody emotions are and how to control them how to notice them but they are what's making me feel that way. I handle it better instead of getting mad and just letting it ruin my day or not moment of time.  Prince just blocked change and I hope I have time for that change.  But it's better than sitting on the mind. Just a happier healthier Alex.  Later on down the line. 
5EWH6NjoLNfgSih6KGzSv4MmSTf2	I spent the night at my boyfriend, so I got to wake up with him as usual.  and then we got up this morning and  I do whatever I have to do and he just kind of laying in bed.

His mom left and then I went home and relax for a little bit as in my best friend Caitlin. My turn me over. I went over to her house. We hung out for a few hours until her boyfriend got off work and now I'm back home and I'm on my computer playing one of my video games on my computer and watching a YouTube video.

5HUievAr4vaEH6NP8cR9B20aBJ83	No. Because I trust her enough to trust me
5HUievAr4vaEH6NP8cR9B20aBJ83	No. Nothing I can think of
5HUievAr4vaEH6NP8cR9B20aBJ83	Correct myself before correcting others
5HUievAr4vaEH6NP8cR9B20aBJ83	Just took deep breaths and think of things that make me happy. 
5HUievAr4vaEH6NP8cR9B20aBJ83	A dream I had last night. It has been bothering me all day. This is the second dream about cheating & I can’t see who the other person is. I don’t know why I let it bug me.
5HUievAr4vaEH6NP8cR9B20aBJ83	I am so proud my accomplishments 
5HUievAr4vaEH6NP8cR9B20aBJ83	I am great person who deserves wonderful things 
5HUievAr4vaEH6NP8cR9B20aBJ83	Just ignore what was going on
5HUievAr4vaEH6NP8cR9B20aBJ83	I’m excited to see my brothers 
5HUievAr4vaEH6NP8cR9B20aBJ83	I’m looking forward to eating & seeing my girlfriend
5HUievAr4vaEH6NP8cR9B20aBJ83	To breath, maybe talk it out 
5HUievAr4vaEH6NP8cR9B20aBJ83	The kids. They always bring joy, 
5HUievAr4vaEH6NP8cR9B20aBJ83	My feelings will always be valid. 
5HUievAr4vaEH6NP8cR9B20aBJ83	Bc I don’t like arguing with my mom
5HUievAr4vaEH6NP8cR9B20aBJ83	Lately I have just been exhausted & want to sleep. It was a good day, just lacked energy.
5HUievAr4vaEH6NP8cR9B20aBJ83	A couple of minutes. Less than 5
5HUievAr4vaEH6NP8cR9B20aBJ83	"Finish getting dress
Pack up the car
Head to my aunts 
Enjoy Christmas "
5HUievAr4vaEH6NP8cR9B20aBJ83	I was able to clean up under the car port & my room. Was able to relax a little 
5HUievAr4vaEH6NP8cR9B20aBJ83	I’m thankful to help prepare the food 
5HUievAr4vaEH6NP8cR9B20aBJ83	I feel Excitement is missing. We do the same thing everyday; things sometimes feel like a routine now. Also feel like their is a lack of attention given or just communication all around.
5HUievAr4vaEH6NP8cR9B20aBJ83	Besides earlier today. About a week ago
5HUievAr4vaEH6NP8cR9B20aBJ83	My breathing became rapid. My hear beat was increased. Had a weird feeling in my stomach & just started to feel like crying.
5HUievAr4vaEH6NP8cR9B20aBJ83	I’m upset, disappointed, sad, annoyed & frustrated.
5HUievAr4vaEH6NP8cR9B20aBJ83	It made me freak out because there was no trigger to feel anxious.
5HUievAr4vaEH6NP8cR9B20aBJ83	Tomorrow is Christmas Eve & I’m grateful to be able to see my brothers & dad.
5HUievAr4vaEH6NP8cR9B20aBJ83	"Clean up my room.
Get ready to see my dad.
Tonight help my mom prep food for Christmas "
5HUievAr4vaEH6NP8cR9B20aBJ83	Learned that my reactions are toxic to me and the whole situation
5HUievAr4vaEH6NP8cR9B20aBJ83	My body can do some pretty incredible things
5HUievAr4vaEH6NP8cR9B20aBJ83	We both believe education is important. That family comes first, we’re both value family. Football is our favorite sport to watch & we both played basketball, so kind of competitive. We’re both stubborn, but also generous. Very goal attained & have a drive to be somebody/successful.
5HUievAr4vaEH6NP8cR9B20aBJ83	I kind of blew up. I reacted instead of observing & staying calm. I let my emotions get the best of me
5HUievAr4vaEH6NP8cR9B20aBJ83	Thanking them for what they try to do.
5HUievAr4vaEH6NP8cR9B20aBJ83	We agree on our goals & aspirations we have in life. We share the same morals & family values.
5HUievAr4vaEH6NP8cR9B20aBJ83	Never check or go through her phone. The only time I look at her phone is if she happens to be on it in front of me to where I see the screen. Does she go through mine? No, not that I’m aware of, but I’m sure she doesn’t.
5HUievAr4vaEH6NP8cR9B20aBJ83	By spending quality time together. Some 1-1 time/
5HUievAr4vaEH6NP8cR9B20aBJ83	She is the sun to my rainy days. She’s calm when I rage like a storm. Lifts my chin up height when I hang my head down low. She is the sweetness to my sour ways. In ways we are similar but in many ways we are different. 
5HUievAr4vaEH6NP8cR9B20aBJ83	Go out to dance, hang at home, shop.
5HUievAr4vaEH6NP8cR9B20aBJ83	Honestly, sometimes I feel good. I like having my space, but most of the time incomplete, lonely, bored & sad.
5HUievAr4vaEH6NP8cR9B20aBJ83	We spend a lot of time together, not so much during school breaks, but throughout the year we are together every day
5HUievAr4vaEH6NP8cR9B20aBJ83	I’m pretty sure it was me. And it kind of just happened. 
5HUievAr4vaEH6NP8cR9B20aBJ83	Separated from the situation & removed my self from the ones upsetting me
5HUievAr4vaEH6NP8cR9B20aBJ83	We argue about cleanness, attention, not making decisions on things, how we treat others/how others treat us. 
5HUievAr4vaEH6NP8cR9B20aBJ83	My mom doesn’t say any negative things about my relationship nor has nothing negative to say about my partner, so my view is that my relationship is a positive thing for my life; for me.
5HUievAr4vaEH6NP8cR9B20aBJ83	With her friends not so much, but her family is good company.
5HUievAr4vaEH6NP8cR9B20aBJ83	I’d say we are a more humorous couple.
5HUievAr4vaEH6NP8cR9B20aBJ83	Yes, only thing is I tolerate them..
5HUievAr4vaEH6NP8cR9B20aBJ83	My partner at times has some road rage & can be careless at times.
5HUievAr4vaEH6NP8cR9B20aBJ83	Love means loyalty. Being there for someone through good & bad. Love is tough, hard, but passionate & joyful. Love is confused for attention & expectations, but love has no limits & love isn’t the same meaning for everyone.
5HUievAr4vaEH6NP8cR9B20aBJ83	Our first kiss was a “heat in the moment” type kiss, but also quite anticipating.
5HUievAr4vaEH6NP8cR9B20aBJ83	I would like for my partner to talk to me, not only listen but reinsure me she is here for me & help me get through what ever it is I’m facing. I feel like have discussed the best approaches to certain situations, but i don’t know if I was very up front & honest about how I want to be treated.
5HUievAr4vaEH6NP8cR9B20aBJ83	My mom seems to be unhappy & takes it out on everyone else. She gets upset when things go her way & it’s upsetting. She says she don’t want to be like my grandma but she is. She always makes a big deal/problem out of everything. Then blames everyone else b  she’s unhappy.
5HUievAr4vaEH6NP8cR9B20aBJ83	I was just sitting alone on my phone. Kind of felt nauseous & my stomach has been hurting.
5LnrhbeIc1RpFWa1DElG2b121iQ2	I saw it in the App Store 
5LnrhbeIc1RpFWa1DElG2b121iQ2	Mostly because of my ex bf

But it seems real to everyone else and thinks that my life is so good.  And nothing bad happens to me and I'm just as happy person cuz I don't show any other emotion.  That's cool towards anyone else. I'm just nice to everyone else.  And I'm always smiling at school.  And I'm not really quiet at school. I just talk whenever.  so it's not like I'm trying to hide something or  I'm shy.  But as soon as I leave the school, and I'm not with my friends.  I completely shut down and all of that emotion just stops.  And it goes to sadness in the Press.  And even anger sometimes and I I don't know it just does.  Whenever I come home, I just think that all my friends aren't my friends.  and that they are just there because they  are just there and I just  I'm thinking they are my friend. I don't like me or anything.  But also like my friend group, there's for others and then me.  they all hang out together and  I don't get invited at all.  That really hurts.  And I don't know why I'm nice to all of them.  So I don't understand why I don't get invited to anything.  And it hurts it really hurts.  but the other day  I was texting one of my friends that is in my group.  And I was texting and I was like where the crap are you because it looks different. She's a oh, I'm at this other girl's house. That's how  Okay, and then I was like who's there then? She said the other two girls that are in my group so they were all there.  And I was just at home doing nothing, but previously to that week that same girl. I told her that we should hang out and she said yeah we could do that, but we didn't and then I was acting all mad at her and just short texting her answers.  And cheese. Are you mad at me? And I said No, and then we head a soccer game.  After like a little later than that, so she asked me if I wanted to hang out or go to her house. And I know that's why because I was acting all mad at her so I didn't really make me feel better.  But she asked me to go to her house for the hangout whatever didn't really make me feel any better because I know she was just asking me because she knew something was up with me.  didn't I make it feel better, but  whatever  and my relationship  isn't Elizabeth's we don't really  Hawk  That much is we should.  Can we?  Fight all the time. lumos broken up like  twice  Nas  previous ones  bus  Yeah, we don't really hang out either.  And he just leaves me on open all the time for actually no reason it gets me mad.  Pretty much pit of my feeling right now.

5gxu4HNtorc7qqqfocHSJfxlswW2	Right now I am thinking.  What is the next chapter in Jackie's life?  What do I need to do to?  Not be so stagnated in life.  I'm married and I feel like I'm at I'm alone sometimes and I just really don't understand.  That I feel almost like I'm a prisoner being married.  We're not doing anything. We're not going anywhere.  And I just feel like I'm stagnated in my career.  in my  marriage  You know, is this the right person for me? Should I be married to him even?  every single time  we get into a heated discussion.  It's almost like I'm being blamed for something that he does.  And it's actually mental abuse. At least that's the way I feel.  you know it sometimes feel like  I have to second-guess myself, and I shouldn't have to do that.  We had a situation.  where  We plan to go out of town.  His daughter's 21st birthday.  I made reservations. I got tickets, which was in November.  and  now all the sudden he just don't want to go and I asked him the reason why.  And he said oh, well, that's Super Bowl weekend.  So when I Intel get in contact with the other people that are going with us.  Going to get upset.  And so he didn't say that he said, you know, everything is dumped over in my lap. Like I'm the villain.  I like I've done something wrong.  I just don't like the way they feel.  It's exhausting.  It makes me you know, feel like  I can't move forward with my day along with other problems I have going on.  And it just don't feel good.  So what is going on in the mind of Jackie right now? Tell me all about it. 
5gxu4HNtorc7qqqfocHSJfxlswW2	Well, I have some issues.  And it's got something to do with my relationship from my marriage. 
5h7ANEyXklSdM6YVKB38Rx3bIsf2	When they’re mad and you just tell them that
5h7ANEyXklSdM6YVKB38Rx3bIsf2	No, but thank you for listening. 
5h7ANEyXklSdM6YVKB38Rx3bIsf2	From looking for a diary in the App Store. 
5h7ANEyXklSdM6YVKB38Rx3bIsf2	I don't know if there's really anything I can do for self-care today. I'm just going to probably go to sleep. 
5h7ANEyXklSdM6YVKB38Rx3bIsf2	You don’t need to tell them all the time just remind them that you love them when it’s most important 
5h7ANEyXklSdM6YVKB38Rx3bIsf2	Okay, I guess everything's just being a little weird right now. 
5h7ANEyXklSdM6YVKB38Rx3bIsf2	Like everybody at school being with very annoying and things at home. Just happening people.  Conflicting things that make me go back and remember old things that happen and becomes bad again. 
5h7ANEyXklSdM6YVKB38Rx3bIsf2	Talk to people helping up more to people that I know I can really trust and know that we'll be there for me. 
5h7ANEyXklSdM6YVKB38Rx3bIsf2	It’s been okay I’ve recently gotten broken up with and I’ve been all over the place but my ex who broke up with me is still my friend so I’m adjusting 
5h7ANEyXklSdM6YVKB38Rx3bIsf2	the sadness and loneliness 
5h7ANEyXklSdM6YVKB38Rx3bIsf2	He’s a bad boy and does dumb things that get me mad but I still love him
5h7ANEyXklSdM6YVKB38Rx3bIsf2	I want to get to know each other on another level so we can better understand eachother
5h7ANEyXklSdM6YVKB38Rx3bIsf2	His little sisters friends because they kept playing with him
5i2RUEYof0SoSlPNOcS4qFteD4x1	If they would pressure me into doing something I don’t want to do; but that rarely happens.
5i2RUEYof0SoSlPNOcS4qFteD4x1	I’m thinking about leaving him for good 
5i2RUEYof0SoSlPNOcS4qFteD4x1	I want attention and he’s out drinking 
5i2RUEYof0SoSlPNOcS4qFteD4x1	How do I stop overthinking things 
5i2RUEYof0SoSlPNOcS4qFteD4x1	The idea of my boyfriend cheating on me with his ex girlfriend 
5i2RUEYof0SoSlPNOcS4qFteD4x1	It’s not new but I got a lot of compliments today from people I work with and customers. I don’t even have any make up in or anything. Just naturally me. 
5i2RUEYof0SoSlPNOcS4qFteD4x1	I feel like my boyfriend is cheating on me 
5i2RUEYof0SoSlPNOcS4qFteD4x1	I’m so conflicted with my emotions towards my ex boyfriend right now. 
5i2RUEYof0SoSlPNOcS4qFteD4x1	Drunk calls from my boyfriend 
5i2RUEYof0SoSlPNOcS4qFteD4x1	My emotions are getting the best of me
5i2RUEYof0SoSlPNOcS4qFteD4x1	I wish he’d stop drinking so much 
5i2RUEYof0SoSlPNOcS4qFteD4x1	My boyfriend doesn’t love me anymore; has lost interest or doesn’t care about me anymore. He won’t respond to my texts. 
5i2RUEYof0SoSlPNOcS4qFteD4x1	Dancing after clocking out. 
5i2RUEYof0SoSlPNOcS4qFteD4x1	Cardio; leg day; sometimes upper body 
5i2RUEYof0SoSlPNOcS4qFteD4x1	Nothing; I feel nauseous now. 
5i2RUEYof0SoSlPNOcS4qFteD4x1	Then we’d all judge each other harder. 
5i2RUEYof0SoSlPNOcS4qFteD4x1	I think my boyfriend is cheating on me 
5i2RUEYof0SoSlPNOcS4qFteD4x1	I’m so confused with school
5i2RUEYof0SoSlPNOcS4qFteD4x1	He continues to let me down. 
5i2RUEYof0SoSlPNOcS4qFteD4x1	I went to work. Came home. Ate dinner with my family. Got bored. I’m in a weird place with my ex bf right now. I’m confused. We both still love each other and care about each other but can’t commit. 
5i2RUEYof0SoSlPNOcS4qFteD4x1	Anxiety, depression, fear, paranoia, worrisome, emotional. 
5i2RUEYof0SoSlPNOcS4qFteD4x1	I felt as if today was productive overall. I went to work. Did what I had to do and came back home. 
5i2RUEYof0SoSlPNOcS4qFteD4x1	It’s raining outside. I can’t stop thinking about my ex. I wonder if he’s thinking about me. I’m stressed about school and tuition and I’ve been spending time with another friend that may potentially turn into something serious. I can’t help but feel like I’m cheating on my ex. We both have talked about working things out between us and he claims that he isn’t seeing anyone right now but he is in the know that I do have a crush on someone rn. 
5i2RUEYof0SoSlPNOcS4qFteD4x1	I’m thinking if my ex boyfriend is really mad at me or if he just threw a fit because he’s childish when he doesn’t get what he wants. I wonder if he’ll realize he’s wrong. 
5i2RUEYof0SoSlPNOcS4qFteD4x1	Annoyed; irritated; neglected
5i2RUEYof0SoSlPNOcS4qFteD4x1	Tied my hair back. I rarely tie my hair back. 
5i2RUEYof0SoSlPNOcS4qFteD4x1	Always smiling through the pain.
5i2RUEYof0SoSlPNOcS4qFteD4x1	With the people I love and care about. 
5i2RUEYof0SoSlPNOcS4qFteD4x1	Yeah! That’d be pretty cool! 
5i2RUEYof0SoSlPNOcS4qFteD4x1	They still aren't better 😕
5i2RUEYof0SoSlPNOcS4qFteD4x1	My coworkers and I encountered a weirdo
5i2RUEYof0SoSlPNOcS4qFteD4x1	Idk; it’s been a little weird. 
5i2RUEYof0SoSlPNOcS4qFteD4x1	Experiencing my love for my coworkers; they are amazing people who have interesting and different perspectives on life and situations.
5i2RUEYof0SoSlPNOcS4qFteD4x1	Working and personal hygiene? Keeping myself clean and washing my clothes. Errands I guess? 
5i2RUEYof0SoSlPNOcS4qFteD4x1	My ex is a disappointment when he is dry through text or always drinking 
5i2RUEYof0SoSlPNOcS4qFteD4x1	Waking up feeling happy/normal 
5i2RUEYof0SoSlPNOcS4qFteD4x1	I’m anxious. I feel like my boyfriend is cheating on me. 
5joUKnVvv3Ucff80dl64ojeHcK42	It was a guy I was on a date with
5joUKnVvv3Ucff80dl64ojeHcK42	It’s been a pretty standard day! I just went to work and came home.... I planned on resting but ended up going out with a guy for a third night stand and that ended bad lol
5pA6kgqAu6Qcv2AwvbBV1Ne557f2	My phone case wallpaper etc 
5pA6kgqAu6Qcv2AwvbBV1Ne557f2	School isn’t going to well and I’m not talented 
5pA6kgqAu6Qcv2AwvbBV1Ne557f2	I love anime and I am a weeb I don’t express myself that much and am usaly quiet 
5pC8RxiZSpVop5TRJEw35s4AjtO2	Fear of the unknown. Anxiety about george. Sadness about wanting divorce and being alone 
5pC8RxiZSpVop5TRJEw35s4AjtO2	Playing monopoly with my son, Tony. Except when I got the jail card and couldn’t pass go. Ha ha
5qHcBiGGA8eT38STe9jWk4hTr1k2	That my husband does not respect me. He doesn't listen to me and he yells at me all the time. 
5qHcBiGGA8eT38STe9jWk4hTr1k2	I don't know. It's hard to talk to somebody who won't listen to you. 
5qHcBiGGA8eT38STe9jWk4hTr1k2	No, because he yelled at me even if I say the sky is very blue today. Then he gets angry and yells at me. So I don't know how he feels he's because he doesn't tell me his only emotion that he shows his anger. He doesn't tell me what he thinks. He doesn't tell me what he wants so I can't read minds. 
5qHcBiGGA8eT38STe9jWk4hTr1k2	Well, yes, he could actually listen to me. He could actually try talking with me. He could not yell at me. I think all of those things would be helpful. 
5qHcBiGGA8eT38STe9jWk4hTr1k2	If my husband loved me and respected me. 
5qHcBiGGA8eT38STe9jWk4hTr1k2	Well, probably the only possible time would be on an evening.  Because he stays at work goes to work early and he gets home extremely late. So in the evening, and and that's when I tried to talk to him before but he always says he's too tired. 
5qHcBiGGA8eT38STe9jWk4hTr1k2	I don't know. I would like to be happy again, though. 
5qHcBiGGA8eT38STe9jWk4hTr1k2	I've tried to ask him to go to counseling many times, but he has refused so no, it has not been successful. 
5qHcBiGGA8eT38STe9jWk4hTr1k2	That my husband breaks my heart every day. 
5qHcBiGGA8eT38STe9jWk4hTr1k2	I don't know.  He yells at me all the time, and I don't know why. 
5qHcBiGGA8eT38STe9jWk4hTr1k2	I don't know why he yells at me.  I used to be nice and now he's not nice anymore and it's been going on for a long time and it makes me really sad and I'm not happy and I don't want to keep living my life with somebody who yells at me. 
5qHcBiGGA8eT38STe9jWk4hTr1k2	I have not but I would like to try but everytime I try to even start talking to him he  Start yelling at me or he looks down at the floor and they leave the room. So I mean it's hard to talk to somebody who won't even stay in the same room with you and talk in the Civil normal manner. 
5qHcBiGGA8eT38STe9jWk4hTr1k2	I guess just journaling about my thoughts and feelings and what whatever is worrying me or stressing me out or whatever making me sad or you know, sometimes just simple things to. 
5y5Nuw62kGgnAev4doJkWC3VIQv1	A guy who was around my age, my mom, his parents, and a office lady
5y5Nuw62kGgnAev4doJkWC3VIQv1	I feel like people don’t like me
5y5Nuw62kGgnAev4doJkWC3VIQv1	That I don’t look good in crimped hair
5y5Nuw62kGgnAev4doJkWC3VIQv1	Has filling up the room in math 
5y5Nuw62kGgnAev4doJkWC3VIQv1	No all of them, but I did get my lab done!
5y5Nuw62kGgnAev4doJkWC3VIQv1	I went to torrid and tried on clothes
5y5Nuw62kGgnAev4doJkWC3VIQv1	It felt more real and that he tried to kiss me
68l3t39vHUUzMlIPJZV7bnpas8g2	I typed journaling into the App Store. 
68l3t39vHUUzMlIPJZV7bnpas8g2	I just love my husband and always feel so overwhelmingly grateful for him even when he’s a turd. I hope I don’t muddle this all up. 
6BctbRU5UyecTyP6oi6SCVQFCo12	well, I really enjoyed spending time with my friends and going to a bar and connecting but  I also had some trouble.  connecting to my family in  being on a trip back home.  I don't really feel like I belong here anymore.  I guess it's  Vulnerable to be in a place. That's so  Turkish brings me back to somewhere. I feel like I've evolved form. 
6BctbRU5UyecTyP6oi6SCVQFCo12	I'm really torn about this move.  really torn about if my  my heart is really leading in the right direction.  I feel really  I feel really excited. I feel like a lot of good things are headed toward me but  I catch myself being too focused on the wrong thing. Sometimes I worry about my body a little too much. I think to BLT.  I worried that I think about myself so much to be honest.  He's going to put my focus on other people.  Jaime I intend to lead with love and I have an idea of myself that I lead with love but sometimes I fear that really am I'm bleeding with a self-obsessed and quite selfish need to achieve.  It's interesting that.  I do moments that seem the most Resident where i c e  little kids from where I come from or inspired and excited.  beautiful  to look at me and see.  Someone who made it.  n  Can I see in them?  These kids are slow people.  If it wasn't for them.  I think it would make no sense right now, but it keeps making sense.  I do feel that I am being called.  But it's hard is it also feels like I'm running away from Something. I Don't Know.  I think sometimes I like all I'm running away from my sexuality and I really I'm a closeted gay and with a woman who is working so hard just to run it run it run for me something a.m.  That's not true.  I don't know why I feel ashamed surrounding my sexuality.  so often  What is in fact true that I'm very in love with a woman?  And I'm just weirdly afraid that externally other people won't believe that and I guess that is something I need to kill is external validation in.  Believing I'm straight but something I got to kill.  the same problem I've had since I was in sixth grade or someone said you're gay said I'm not game like at my game system should have been with their  are you see what else?  I honestly wish I could never come back home to Buffalo again and never see again.  I do feel decide to run away from my family and completely disconnect and  I think it hurts me to realize that that's what I want. It feels painful and wrong.  and selfish  that is what I want.  right now at least  And I guess it seems painful and selfish to me to want to like to myself to want to go to La and you know, all these beautiful people. I love so much you are what I call home in New York. Why would I leave that but for some reason?  I feel that I'm on.  Beginnings of a brand new Journey that I can only go on alone.  That's what I'm thinking about. 
6BctbRU5UyecTyP6oi6SCVQFCo12	I like to get a beer at the bar and this guy was just like saw me.  it was such a simple act of kindness, but  really threw me for a loop in.  Reminded me the small ways. I can be kind. 
6D5r2bGa69QJLz5592raCBrdtO13	I honestly just needed somebody to talk to so I looked up journaling apps and download in this.

But as far as like, you know, whether Legacy you leave on the world other than just being in that kind of like I'm afraid of becoming my dad and the fact that he doesn't have anything right now going for him and I don't want to be a person that doesn't have anything going for them.

6YoGfvFZIMYyxh65i3ddvWCvJt13	I'm going to see my boyfriend. 
6YoGfvFZIMYyxh65i3ddvWCvJt13	Coming home to sleep or possibly going out for NYE with my family. 
6YoGfvFZIMYyxh65i3ddvWCvJt13	Coming home from work. Lol
6YoGfvFZIMYyxh65i3ddvWCvJt13	A significant member from my day would probably have to be having a facial with my little sister. 
6YoGfvFZIMYyxh65i3ddvWCvJt13	My boyfriend is very shy, especially around my family. However today he interacted well with my family. We even had a music session where he played e keyboard and I sang. I loved that so much. 🥰 
6YoGfvFZIMYyxh65i3ddvWCvJt13	I need to arrange for lunch for a workshop I’m having. Also need to call the participants for the workshop. Need to complete my Canadian Visa application too 
6YoGfvFZIMYyxh65i3ddvWCvJt13	I kind of feel sad that I wasn’t able to help my boyfriend out of his bad mood today. I don’t like knowing that someone I care about is not okay and I am unable to help them. It really affects me. So that really put a damper on my day. 
6YoGfvFZIMYyxh65i3ddvWCvJt13	As I said today was one of those mixed emotion days. So I had to be dealing with my mom was just never normally good and then my boyfriend is possibly State Keys had a headache all day. So that is kind of worried me and kind of concerned about him right now trying to figure out what I do tonight if I should go and stay with him. No trying to make him feel better, but It's been an emotionally draining day kind of but it's been a good day. So yeah. 
6YoGfvFZIMYyxh65i3ddvWCvJt13	I don't think there's anything else to share it was an okay day. 
6YoGfvFZIMYyxh65i3ddvWCvJt13	I can release hurt or anger and replace it with joy. 
6YoGfvFZIMYyxh65i3ddvWCvJt13	Everything is wonderful, just the way it is 
6YoGfvFZIMYyxh65i3ddvWCvJt13	I know what I’m doing and everything will be okay. 
6YoGfvFZIMYyxh65i3ddvWCvJt13	I will Embrace everything that life throws my way. 
6YoGfvFZIMYyxh65i3ddvWCvJt13	I know it is possible to tune out the negative 
6YoGfvFZIMYyxh65i3ddvWCvJt13	Well, the good part of the day was a fact that I was on the phone my boyfriend flight go to the day. I don't know he was in a very talkative mood today. So he had me on the phone with him for most of the day. Also. I was very productive at a lot of church work and government work done. So that's good so good.

6YoGfvFZIMYyxh65i3ddvWCvJt13	I mean it was a productive day. I got a lot done but you know, I was home with my mom so I had that to deal with so my mood was kind of all over the place. You know, I was one of those days. 
6YoGfvFZIMYyxh65i3ddvWCvJt13	It was an okay enough day. I spent most of it on the road so I didn’t get to accomplish much. Had a headache and it rained. My boyfriend wasn’t okay which affected my mood. But I still managed to get some stuff done when I got home so I’m proud of that. 
6YoGfvFZIMYyxh65i3ddvWCvJt13	My to-do list today is pretty short. Just gonna do some preliminary work for my programme graduation ceremony in March. 
6YoGfvFZIMYyxh65i3ddvWCvJt13	I do actually I think I got a lot done today. I wish I had got some more done but I did get a lot done today because I think I've completed everything on my to-do list for today. So yeah. 
6YoGfvFZIMYyxh65i3ddvWCvJt13	Yes I was actually. My only task today was to visit my family and take them some groceries etc. spend some time with them while spending time with my boyfriend. Mission accomplished. 
6YoGfvFZIMYyxh65i3ddvWCvJt13	I definitely accomplished a lot today cuz I visited the old age home and delivered some stuff. I meant to have a tree about a lot of stuff done there. I had to going to try some drinking half a tree and came home and I did some more cleaning and decluttering and stuff and I'm about to have some dinner and then I'm going to some school work. So it's been a very productive day today. I want to actually work out look at the bat. 
6YoGfvFZIMYyxh65i3ddvWCvJt13	I completed most of my goals... washing my car and cooking. I didn’t get to do any school work though or the job hunt I wanted to do. 
6YoGfvFZIMYyxh65i3ddvWCvJt13	So my to do list on a Saturday is usually very short because it's my stop at so I don't really do like work work say was mostly a self-care stuff like log in my mood. I'm taking my vitamins and stuff which I have accomplished completing. This night routine is probably one of the last things my to do list apart from the reading a chapter for today, which I'm going to do before bed some pretty good with the to do list that I had for today, but I'm also proud because I've started things for my from my to-do list for tomorrow. So that's good. 
6YoGfvFZIMYyxh65i3ddvWCvJt13	I actually got everything that I wanted to get done done today. Actually. Yeah, I'm really proud of that. I got everything on my to-do list done today.

6YoGfvFZIMYyxh65i3ddvWCvJt13	Being able to take it easy today and prepare mentally for work 
6YoGfvFZIMYyxh65i3ddvWCvJt13	Probably my ability to block out certain things instead of liking every little thing bother me. I have the ability to light block them out more times. Yeah. 
6YoGfvFZIMYyxh65i3ddvWCvJt13	I guess my finances because when I think about it, I'm going to have to buy gas in order to go to the country. But I'm still grateful that I can afford to buy the gas that I have a job that finances main gas as much as you know, it's not the best but it still exists. So I'm grateful. 
6YoGfvFZIMYyxh65i3ddvWCvJt13	Nature and it’s soothing sounds
6YoGfvFZIMYyxh65i3ddvWCvJt13	Being able to get my chores done instead of going to work 
6YoGfvFZIMYyxh65i3ddvWCvJt13	I’m thankful that my body is not in pain after the workout I did yesterday. 
6YoGfvFZIMYyxh65i3ddvWCvJt13	Today was a really good day at church was first step out. So the choir song was also the first about the the New Year my new responsibilities new offices. So I went to the primary Sabbath School class time this morning and that was that was also knows better than I expected. So I was really nice things. And yeah, so I did to that was really the primary Sabbath school and then because I'm also part of the children's ministry this year. I was asked to help out with the children's story in church today. So, you know, it was a very busy day at church but I like church busy. So I didn't mind I actually enjoyed it and then I came home had enough and I have been very productive tonight by iron for work next week already and I also learned some stuff for my Dad. We're basically don't wash it and I have some meat that I want to season for dinner and lunch. next week and I'm about to go and pack my stuff for next week cuz I'm moving back into my  place in st.

6YoGfvFZIMYyxh65i3ddvWCvJt13	"To be honest, I do have some stuff on my to-do list but I don’t think they will get done because of some last minute expectations that are being placed on me.

6YoGfvFZIMYyxh65i3ddvWCvJt13	Interacting with children and controlling my emotions to an extent 
6YoGfvFZIMYyxh65i3ddvWCvJt13	I guess that would probably just become I'm thankful for the fact that I have learned how to be calm in stressful situations, you know in times when I should be angry or annoyed. I've learned to just block out whatever it is. That is annoying me. Just stay calm. 
6YoGfvFZIMYyxh65i3ddvWCvJt13	"Deliver some gift items to an elderly home.

6YoGfvFZIMYyxh65i3ddvWCvJt13	To be honest, I think the best part of my day was Sabbath school this morning with the children. 
6YoGfvFZIMYyxh65i3ddvWCvJt13	I watched a movie and wrote down some goals. 
6YoGfvFZIMYyxh65i3ddvWCvJt13	The most noteworthy moment from my day was actually when I went to as an AM because you know, it's always a good feeling when I go there. People are so warm and welcoming and friendly Galaxy on faces. And then I had a good chat with Aunt is a sealed after that. So it was probably the highlight of my day today. 
6YoGfvFZIMYyxh65i3ddvWCvJt13	Yes, I am learning to do that for me. 
6YoGfvFZIMYyxh65i3ddvWCvJt13	Actually had a headache last night into this morning, but I know it was because I was tired. So because I kind of took it slow today and it and had my water. My headache is kind of gone. 
6YoGfvFZIMYyxh65i3ddvWCvJt13	Today was good because I was able to accomplish most of my everything on my to-do list. You'll accomplish things. I didn't think I would have gotten done today and I got a little rest because I came home and rested. Yeah, I mean, it's the last day of 2019 so I would not be good, right? 
6YoGfvFZIMYyxh65i3ddvWCvJt13	"My day was filled with love and happiness. My boyfriend came to visit my grandparents with me for the first time. Watching him interact with them and be loved and accepted by them was so heart warming. 
The journey to and from also made me love him even more cuz we could chat and laugh about any and everything and learn so much more about each other. "

6nEI4BgSEUVRd4Wg40vRUj6MAWd2	Cooking a good meal in reading a good book. 
6nEI4BgSEUVRd4Wg40vRUj6MAWd2	Cook dinner.  Take my medication.  Write in my journal and hopefully write a story. 
6nEI4BgSEUVRd4Wg40vRUj6MAWd2	I was swimming in the ocean and the water was completely clear. I can see the bottom from anywhere that I was swimming.  I felt peaceful. 
6nEI4BgSEUVRd4Wg40vRUj6MAWd2	I have a recurring dream about a library that's hidden behind a like a mechanic's garage.  Are the ways I'd like to have a dream about the lighthouse that I visit my dreams.

6qVSs4FqSDRl6bPScf7GvBZuUPD2	What would a new spouse introduce someone to I don't know I'm not married. 
6qVSs4FqSDRl6bPScf7GvBZuUPD2	There is no name for a stressful bake its the baking relieves my stress. 
6qVSs4FqSDRl6bPScf7GvBZuUPD2	That's a great question. If I had the answer to that probably wouldn't need this app. My only guess is that I was selfish younger didn't want to be married didn't want to have to manage to manage. Someone else's emotions and feelings outside of my own wanted to focus on getting my education getting a college degree, which I have a bachelor's and a master's and establishing a solid footing in my career or priorities for me at that time plus relationships are not as stable as I would have liked to actually lend itself to possibly to the idea of becoming married. 
6qVSs4FqSDRl6bPScf7GvBZuUPD2	I don't know why a new family member would it's just as well, maybe cuz they don't know who I am, but I don't know why they wouldn't know who I am unless it's maybe from like my cousins in-laws like my cousin spouses and their families that can be the only way left new family member would introduce themselves to me. Other than that, my family knows who I am and they wouldn't introduce themselves to Meats. They would introduce people to me. But yeah. 
6qVSs4FqSDRl6bPScf7GvBZuUPD2	How would I introduce myself to a new friend?  possibly  introduce who I am what I do.  And emphasize my family because they're big part of my life.  And that I like to travel may be reinforced or mention that I actually like to travel and in the places that I've been if I can but for the most part when they first meet someone I usually more of a listener than a talker I talk more after I get to know them versus when I first meet them. 
6qVSs4FqSDRl6bPScf7GvBZuUPD2	I will take action to create the life I want. 
6qVSs4FqSDRl6bPScf7GvBZuUPD2	I think the day I most eagerly awaiting the birthday cake. It's my favorite cake from edit cake design and I love the flavor and it makes me it makes me happy when every bite reminds me of a happy childhood and happy times. 
6qVSs4FqSDRl6bPScf7GvBZuUPD2	I don't need a reason to feel good. 
6qVSs4FqSDRl6bPScf7GvBZuUPD2	what I'm looking forward to the most this year is hopefully settling down in my relationship in a more permanent status and  having a family of my own getting pregnant. 
6qVSs4FqSDRl6bPScf7GvBZuUPD2	I guess I feel most grateful for the opportunity that my students won't be won't need to pay for upcoming conferences at we were able to secure funds and I feel grateful to have somebody who is willing to make the sacrifice of moving from their comfort zone to Florida would be nicer if it was South Florida, but nonetheless moving to Florida because they love me and they want to be with me and ultimately what are most most grateful for is my supportive family, even though sometimes they drive me crazy. I know they're there for me and they love me unconditionally. 
6qVSs4FqSDRl6bPScf7GvBZuUPD2	I am 41 soon to be 42 in July. Never been married. No kids and I very much want to have a family before it's biologically too late. 
6qVSs4FqSDRl6bPScf7GvBZuUPD2	Well today at work. My AP classes are taking an exam. So I might world history classes finishing a project. So it should be fairly easy in terms of teaching a really teaching today. However, the answer key which was supposed to set up last night. I left at work. So I'll be spending my class hours weather testing in my work route planning on setting up the answer key and making copies for the substitute tomorrow since I will not be in work tomorrow or Friday. So at work priority is to make the copies submit the payment for the some of the payment for the substitute. I mean sorry for field trips and then Work on the answer key then after work. I need to pick up the cake get the couscous.  And then get the storage unit with Greg and then come back to the house eat dinner and sing, Happy Birthday to a busy busy day. 
6qVSs4FqSDRl6bPScf7GvBZuUPD2	Well Greg is the one that's moving to Florida.  I think he feels like he has to and that makes me very very nervous and anxious. I know he's doing it cuz he loves me but it's not quite clear as to.  As to him doing it because he wants to because it's something that he seems as a value to our relationship into the health of our relationship. 
6qVSs4FqSDRl6bPScf7GvBZuUPD2	I like baking in general. So if I can bake a cook make a cookie dough mix or cake mix at least once a week that usually satisfies my happiness for the week and don't eat it. Usually I share it. I just like to make it baking is a stress reliever for me or cooking in general. 
6qVSs4FqSDRl6bPScf7GvBZuUPD2	Having my very own family and being a mom excites me the most about that having a best friend and a spouse.  And being able to hopefully share that happiness with my current family.

6wqEj4mvolfSHsK3Zt4UbPaKts23	I feel a lot of anxiety when I feel like I'm being ignored and not heard. 
6wqEj4mvolfSHsK3Zt4UbPaKts23	I am trying to change my mental behavior and trying to start thinking before I act upon it or talk. 
6wqEj4mvolfSHsK3Zt4UbPaKts23	I suppose the only question left that I have for you to talk is how did you discover in words? 
6wqEj4mvolfSHsK3Zt4UbPaKts23	I'm trying to calm my anxiety be talking to you and using this app. 
6wqEj4mvolfSHsK3Zt4UbPaKts23	The situation has not passed yet. So there is nothing that can be done. 
6wqEj4mvolfSHsK3Zt4UbPaKts23	I need to think before I act and take a few breaths before I speak. 
6wqEj4mvolfSHsK3Zt4UbPaKts23	There would be a lot of a lot less stress in this world. 
6wqEj4mvolfSHsK3Zt4UbPaKts23	Because I really love him and I want to marry him and I don't think he feels the same way. 
6wqEj4mvolfSHsK3Zt4UbPaKts23	Usually all afternoon and sometimes into the evening. 
6wqEj4mvolfSHsK3Zt4UbPaKts23	My job as a medical assistant. 
6wqEj4mvolfSHsK3Zt4UbPaKts23	My anxiety went away last night. 
6wqEj4mvolfSHsK3Zt4UbPaKts23	I just talked to my boyfriend on the phone and he is home from work. I sent him a long nice meaningful text message a couple hours ago and he has still not replied to it.  It bothers me when he ignores my messages and he is home because I know he's always on his phone.  And when he doesn't reply it makes me feel like I've done something wrong. My thoughts aren't  Clear or meaningful or what? I say just really doesn't matter to him and it bothers me. 
6wqEj4mvolfSHsK3Zt4UbPaKts23	I would go back about fifteen years and change my behavior and the way I treated my family and never get into don't like I did. 
6wqEj4mvolfSHsK3Zt4UbPaKts23	I got angry and started over think and feel that everything is my fault. I'm never going to be loved by anybody. 
6wqEj4mvolfSHsK3Zt4UbPaKts23	I wish everyone had a big heart and was kind to others as I am to them. 
6wqEj4mvolfSHsK3Zt4UbPaKts23	I would change the fact that I have a mental disorder that interrupts my relationships with family friends boyfriend and kids. 
6wqEj4mvolfSHsK3Zt4UbPaKts23	A co-worker is trying to boss me around and tell me what to do. She is not being a team player.  And she is not working effectively.  My boyfriend is ignoring me when I'm trying to talk to him be sincere tell him my feelings and I don't think he takes me serious.  I am the only one that's been trying to fix this relationship and he has been keeping his distance in his guard up which makes me think he's not into this relationship as much as I am. I don't feel like he cares as much as I do. 
6wqEj4mvolfSHsK3Zt4UbPaKts23	I am at work away from my boyfriend and then there is times where I am at home and I don't feel left. 
6yUjSFG2Q3h9vBV3xEosqQYkwdI2	Saying hello is always nice getting stronger things you can do is maybe having a conversation with someone who does really fit in with the other people I may be comfort them and tell them that they are a good person and that you love hanging out with them even if no one else does you do and it will always happen no matter what and they’re always be someone that likes you who don’t see that and you been OK are not true people and they are just facts and you can tell I say that to people and they will feel or should feel much better about themselves I understand thatYou are a true friend
6yUjSFG2Q3h9vBV3xEosqQYkwdI2	I had a nice day at school
6yUjSFG2Q3h9vBV3xEosqQYkwdI2	I going to trust myself and my own common sense 
6yUjSFG2Q3h9vBV3xEosqQYkwdI2	I proses the qualities I need to be successful 
6yUjSFG2Q3h9vBV3xEosqQYkwdI2	I’m exited to go to school and see my friends😊
6yUjSFG2Q3h9vBV3xEosqQYkwdI2	I will treat my body with passion and respect
6yUjSFG2Q3h9vBV3xEosqQYkwdI2	Because we did fun things today
6yUjSFG2Q3h9vBV3xEosqQYkwdI2	Yesterday when I watched my neighbors dog he was really fun to play with and really cuddly and I felt very happy then as well
6z3c2T36Uyb2d9u1yih650fZwvx2	Me , and a lot of people the gym is great because in a job or other lives their is a heavy influence and people have a somewhat control of your results it’s just you no one to blame all you 
6z3c2T36Uyb2d9u1yih650fZwvx2	It made my mood 10x better that negative emotion was lessened because I felt great unstoppable 
6z3c2T36Uyb2d9u1yih650fZwvx2	It’s a constant grind I love the process and adding more weight weekly and the rush when you did better then the week before 
6z3c2T36Uyb2d9u1yih650fZwvx2	My name is sal I’m 23 currently working as a carpenter I’m also running a re selling business on the side to one day become a real estate investor I enjoy weightlifting and traveling 
6z3c2T36Uyb2d9u1yih650fZwvx2	The weekend had me feeling low but one thing I felt I did right was let out that negative emotion out and transmitted that energy into training
70sdSg3RK5dt00uz0uRnykrIpb83	to be able to draw  cuz it makes me happy. 
70sdSg3RK5dt00uz0uRnykrIpb83	I did a lot of new things. 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	I don't know what's watching over me. 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	I'd rather live in a house and have a car. 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	Quite a bit usually but haven’t been the last few days 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	I only have one mother and she's doing fine. 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	That's a silly question. It looks like I put makeup on. 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	I don't want to live in a house that has a car. I want a car and my own house. 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	So they're not cold or wet or burning up or exposed to any of the other crazy elements in the world. 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	Not sure if I had any new ideas today or not 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	A little too much. I think that way because I always spend too much time on my devices. 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	About different jobs I could do
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	I got outta bed with a good attitude and I took a bath 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	Taking Harper and leaving for good. Although, that is not a new idea. But I did have an idea to approach the cancer treatment center here in Tulsa and see if they needed someone with a lot of love to give to people who have cancer and want to still feel beautiful and loved. With my profession, it could be done. 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	I typed up an order and an interrogatory that Victoria needed for courts. 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	Everything in this world has already been thought of. There are no new ideas. We are a stagnant race. Building things on others backs and leaving no credit for them. I have thought that I want my dad to be okay, but that’s not a new thought. I have been obsessed with it since I was little. 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	"New job. Moving forward with life 
"
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	Helping someone with a pardon with the governor 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	New thoughts??? How am I going to get money to pay my credit card bills. How am I gonna get a job. Etc 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	I work all day tomorrow to make money. 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	I will exhale my fears and breathing confidence. 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	The more I give the more I will receive. 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	I will accept praise when it is due. 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	I am a person of value and I have the right to be treated as such. 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	The fact that my child does not hear Harper went to go play in the snow. 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	Picking my prescription up. That’s really about it. 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	Nothing really maybe when Derek gets home, so I'm not the one watching our poor anymore. 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	Derrick. He gave me my daughter. 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	Nothing really but my dad is getting discharged from the hospital tomorrow morning, which is good. 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	Harper being excited about her toys 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	Putting Harper to bed so just me and my dad can hangout 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	Accomplishment at work. Being with my dad 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	Harper opening presents and playing with papa Dave 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	I got locked out of my GoT account. 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	Hanging out with my dad and Harper when she's being good eating pizza and sleeping. All of it was great. 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	Reading the prophet by Khalil Gibran. 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	Harper playing with her toys. OJ coming over. 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	Figuring out that I can actually do this. I can start my own life 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	I know what I'm doing and everything will be okay. 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	My mistakes do not Define me. They help me grow. 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	Today I step towards being coming a person that thinks big and takes decisive actions. 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	Yes, I definitely feel stuck in my routine. I wake up, Derrick goes to work or when he’s not at work he’s gone, I take care of the shopping and cleaning and caring for our kid. I’m looking for a job to break the routine of nothingness really, or maybe I’ll go back to school for something else. I worry about money. About bills that I have that I can’t pay. Derrick tells me to ask him for money but then freaks out about it. So I don’t like to. 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	The fact that I don’t have a car a job or any money 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	Victoria wouldn’t agree with anything I was doing. Now Harper won’t go to sleep and it is way past bedtime. 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	Same shit as usual. We did Christmas yesterday at derricks moms house and then we had a small Xmas here as well. Derricks son was here which causes me an extreme amount of stress due to the fact that he is violent toward his little sister, my daughter. Derrick decided he wasn’t going to come home tonight. Blaming the weather. He knew when he left on the bike it was going to be cold. So who knows what he’s really doing over there. Maybe if I could reverse hack his phone i could find out. It’s just stressful and I’m over the whole fucking situation. 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	Wrecked my car... almost missed out on $53 that was there for the clothes I sold at Once Upon a Child. Thankfully, Derrick picked it up so I ended up having enough money to cover my credit card payments (two of them at least, the rest are due soon, though) my child won’t listen. Got a killer headache. 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	Everything. I woke up, Harper was raising all hell. Now I’m concerned about a rash that she’s developed and of course Derrick doesn’t see that it’s a big deal but I feel that it is. He doesn’t want to rub two pennies together for her healthcare. It’s sad. I dealt with a crazy almost three year old like I always do. Was asked the same stupid question I’m asked every single night “what’s for dinner”. Then he went off about how everyone is fucking stupid in the world and he hates having good days because someone always pisses him off. I feel like no one can MAKE you feel any sort of way unless you allow it. 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	Getting insurance to cover my medication or getting this different quantity approved 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	I think I do sometimes because I just have so much stuff going on in my everyday life.  And then I feel overwhelmed and feel like I don't want to do it anymore. 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	I finished most of my tasks for the day. I wasn’t able to get much done. 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	The decision to go back to Oklahoma. I haven’t really managed it yet. 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	Yes. Managed to go to my moms like I promised 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	I accomplished quite a few things, actually. I applied to a TON of places even though most of them are not what I went to school for. 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	I was not able to accomplish much. I was able to find a ride to my interview and will be getting some money sent to me most likely. 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	Putting Harper to bed. Made my dad take care of it lol 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	Yes, I did manage to get a lot done. I applied for a ton of jobs. Derrick said he can fix my car but my dad is thinking about just getting me a new one
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	I didn't get anything done. I slept. 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	I got Harper to go to bed finally even tho Derrick isn’t here. I stood up for Harper against Christopher but it got turned around on me, so I feel I didn’t reach any real goals. 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	My ability to talk anyone into almost anything 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	Hanging out with my dad. Smoking weed and having fun 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	Being with Derick and being at this house. I don’t know how I’m going to leave. And I need to. I don’t have a car, but my dad said he’s gonna try to get me the Honda Civic that his neighbor has. It would be in my name! Which means that it would actually BE MINE. I miss my Galant, though. That was the BEST CAR I’ve had since my Impala. I guess I am grateful for the fact that I have a roof over my head 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	I'm feeling grateful that I didn't wake up with a headache. 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	I don't know my iPad my phone all of my facial stuff. That's a biggie and my makeup. 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	My daughters every day life 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	Having a doctor that will still see me and my dog and my child, of course.  And a roof over my head and the all the bills paid when I'm not working. 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	"That it still works after my wreck
"
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	leaving colors numbers music  my dog my daughter jobs Derek my animals other than my dogs.  What I'm going to do the middle room needs to be cleaned out so bad. It's so crowded in there.  It's ugly to look at it makes me anxious. The whole house makes me anxious.  I think I just feel this way. I don't know why I don't have a car. I need a car. I don't have a job. I need a job.  I need a job and a car is make things happen that I want to happen.  But it's not going the way I want it.  So what do I do?  OJ my friend I love her and I would miss her if I left my mom and David they're still here. I don't really care for my grandma, but I know that I'll regret not spending time with her.  Hi Blake.  Play comes to mind so many things come to mind.  I don't know even the TV ants and I comes into mind.  The fan the fact that it's hot, it's not too hot here. It's just not comfortable.  Maybe I need to turn on the air conditioner, but I shouldn't because if I do dare come now, but do I really care? It's hot.  I just don't want to start any arguments. 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	 Nothing much. Got my klonopin though. 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	Went to my moms and hung out there for awhile. Me and Derrick got along all day and Harper had a ton of fun
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	Harper went with Sam and me and my dad got to sleep in all day. 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	Taking care of the baby and the dog and I was supposed to go to an interview, but apparently the interview that Derek told me about he didn't bother to come home to give me the truck to go to.  So that's it. 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	Sleeping. Because I was tired 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	I don't have anything to do today except for maybe look for a job and take care of my daughter. 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	Get dressed. Go to interview 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	Get the baby fed. Get dressed. Go to my interview. 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	Doctor's appointment pick up Derek come home. Take the dog out. I guess there's really nothing this important other than my doctor's appointment I had this morning.  That I had to get up super early for I hate having only one vehicle. But other than that, that's it. 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	Getting thru this file for Victoria. 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	I am grateful that I have so many people who love and care about me. I am also thankful that my dad is here with me and my daughter and that he gets to know his granddaughter. 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	I feel grateful for what Derrick does for us. Even though he’s not the best (almost husband) or father. 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	Relief that my dad feels better. 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	I’m grateful that my dad can see my daughter grow up. 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	I don’t really know. I’m challenged every day by the way I have to walk on eggshells but I do not feel thankful for having to go through it. I guess I’m thankful that I still have a place to live. 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	Samm took Harper for awhile and I got to sleep haha 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	Getting good news about my dad. 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	Well, my child is gone. So I need to clean and I also need to figure out what to do about Zeus because he's crazy and I just don't know what to do. 
720D1w0DsROpWOpjoZ0S8gWOhPu1	Whenever I look in the mirror, I will allow myself to see something positive because I am unique and spending.

7XPXYDy8hhfmDYijvvGyPMqDnSf1	Oh my family and my friends. 
7XPXYDy8hhfmDYijvvGyPMqDnSf1	Emily helps me today. She really comforted me on how I lost my friends but like some of my friends so my friend did when she likes including me and her table  launch 
7XPXYDy8hhfmDYijvvGyPMqDnSf1	well, I started getting good grades in 6th grade, and then now I have  been doing better in school, but maybe I need to study more.

7XPXYDy8hhfmDYijvvGyPMqDnSf1	I feel thankful for every device. I have everything I own like I might not be grateful for it. Looks like I'm not grateful for it, but I'm really thankful for it as I look out on things. 
7XPXYDy8hhfmDYijvvGyPMqDnSf1	I went to school then the library got a large coffee and some munchkins and that's it.

7acjgtH5oVS5bBlmcg1QN2QPoQp1	He didn’t tell me he was lying but I don’t know if he was actually lying to me about telling me he would date me
7acjgtH5oVS5bBlmcg1QN2QPoQp1	Because I’ve been hurt before and I don’t want to get heartbroken again and like I’m kinda ugly 
7acjgtH5oVS5bBlmcg1QN2QPoQp1	Because it’s better when someone vents to someone else than to keep all they’re problems inside of them
7acjgtH5oVS5bBlmcg1QN2QPoQp1	Sometimes the people I hang out with aren’t the best people,they do bad things sometimes and I just don’t act like them,I just hang out with them
7acjgtH5oVS5bBlmcg1QN2QPoQp1	I become very quiet and gloomy
7acjgtH5oVS5bBlmcg1QN2QPoQp1	Maybe life isn’t so bad after all
7acjgtH5oVS5bBlmcg1QN2QPoQp1	I would be very nice to them and then once I get to know them then I become comfortable 
7acjgtH5oVS5bBlmcg1QN2QPoQp1	I wanna be able to go up to my crush and ask him if it’s true that he would actually date me
7acjgtH5oVS5bBlmcg1QN2QPoQp1	My crush told me he likes me or that he would date me☺️
7acjgtH5oVS5bBlmcg1QN2QPoQp1	I’m looking forward to getting skinnier and becoming smarter
7acjgtH5oVS5bBlmcg1QN2QPoQp1	I was able to keep myself from letting myself down and people around me
7acjgtH5oVS5bBlmcg1QN2QPoQp1	I feel very confused and nervous because my crush(my ex’s best friend)told me that he would date me and stuff but I don’t know if he was lying to me or not
7acjgtH5oVS5bBlmcg1QN2QPoQp1	There is a lot to just me but one thing is that I like to have someone to listen to me about stuff
7acjgtH5oVS5bBlmcg1QN2QPoQp1	My ex’s best friend that I’ve kinda gotten a crush for,he told me that he would date me and I feel like he’s not lying to me but I don’t know
7acjgtH5oVS5bBlmcg1QN2QPoQp1	I can’t be to clingy,I’m just gonna act chill and ask him person to person,but it’s kinda hard because my ex hangs out with him and I don’t know if my ex will like it but like I don’t really care what he thinks tbh
7acjgtH5oVS5bBlmcg1QN2QPoQp1	I was supposed to go to school today and ask my crush if he was lying about what he told me
7acjgtH5oVS5bBlmcg1QN2QPoQp1	I am grateful that I have awesome people around me and that I don’t have bad people around me
7acjgtH5oVS5bBlmcg1QN2QPoQp1	Being able to be successful and becoming famous 
7acjgtH5oVS5bBlmcg1QN2QPoQp1	I feel like he probably thinks I’m a good person and stuff like that
7acjgtH5oVS5bBlmcg1QN2QPoQp1	My crush might like me back and I’m excited because tmr I’m going to ask him if it’s true that he would actually date me and if he actually likes me,I hope he says yes
7biotPls7zVuQq7CHFb9uaJBqa62	I will say how was your day
7biotPls7zVuQq7CHFb9uaJBqa62	I like dogs.  Do you like dogs? 
7biymBbporZgUw96s3fD4B8DP493	So my mind can be more open to things. I don't know. 
7biymBbporZgUw96s3fD4B8DP493	I just want to say that.  I hope my day goes on the same. I want to learn something new today and become a new person. 
7biymBbporZgUw96s3fD4B8DP493	Yeah, my break up forced me to think for myself. 
7biymBbporZgUw96s3fD4B8DP493	What's shaking my anxiety was probably thinking about my mom's relapse and how my father was barely in my life and how it's basically me on my own without any help. 
7biymBbporZgUw96s3fD4B8DP493	It made me more happier and more Curious to watch the come. 
7biymBbporZgUw96s3fD4B8DP493	well today there was a shooting at my school and I was kind of scared and I didn't know how to react and I had to run home and I just  broke up with my boyfriend  and  I just feel out of place and hurt. 
7biymBbporZgUw96s3fD4B8DP493	I tried breathing in and out but it kind of added fuel to the fire. 
7biymBbporZgUw96s3fD4B8DP493	I'm trying to get my anxiety. So where it needs to be where it is though. I'm not just sad all the time and want to cry and I want to get my depression to a certain instant where I feel comfortable in my own skin and feel comfortable being myself and sharing myself with others. 
7biymBbporZgUw96s3fD4B8DP493	I'm looking forward to finding things about myself that I didn't know and grow more as a person. 
7biymBbporZgUw96s3fD4B8DP493	How sometimes I just need to talk. 
7biymBbporZgUw96s3fD4B8DP493	I look for inspiration by looking around me and seeing what intrigues me. 
7biymBbporZgUw96s3fD4B8DP493	I thought about things that make me happy. 
7biymBbporZgUw96s3fD4B8DP493	It will allow me to look at things differently.  And the peace will change my day today. 
7biymBbporZgUw96s3fD4B8DP493	That I get to know more about myself that I didn't know and find out me things and explore. 
7biymBbporZgUw96s3fD4B8DP493	I was lying on my bed looking up at the ceiling.  Just staring into my thoughts.

7d1HV6nn44TNkFRnZeczrlntOJh2	By doing the right thing for my body
7dmmIEWzeMYnO0QXaSX2MzAtNbz2	For probably about 5-10 minutes 
7dmmIEWzeMYnO0QXaSX2MzAtNbz2	There was guy who made one for other people interested in writing and drawing their own manga series 
7dmmIEWzeMYnO0QXaSX2MzAtNbz2	"1. Do things for them without them asking 
2. Always look out for them
3. Help them become the best version of themselves 
4. Support them in anything they do
5. Be honest with them "
7dmmIEWzeMYnO0QXaSX2MzAtNbz2	The world would be a better place and there would probably be less violence 
7dmmIEWzeMYnO0QXaSX2MzAtNbz2	I feel like that would make everyone lazy as money is mostly the reason we do what we do however I think it would also make everyone happier 
7dmmIEWzeMYnO0QXaSX2MzAtNbz2	The lady I was attracted to and her feet
7dmmIEWzeMYnO0QXaSX2MzAtNbz2	"Me and the guys were talking inside the store about how one guy wanted a North Face jacket and we helped and joked with him 

My next dream we were talking about something with assistants and one of them I was attracted to and wanted to suck her toes she then took me to this other part of the building and for some reason my extended family was there having a party"
7dmmIEWzeMYnO0QXaSX2MzAtNbz2	I took my medicine when I first woke up

7dmmIEWzeMYnO0QXaSX2MzAtNbz2	My day started off bad my left eye is swollen, felt like I had to vomit, and the girl that’s been on my mind everyday since I’ve met her seems to be getting further away however I still feel good because of these YouTube videos I watched that have helped me with some of the problems I’ve been dealing with 
7dmmIEWzeMYnO0QXaSX2MzAtNbz2	Because I have no motivation to do anything except waste my life away worrying about stupid things 
7dmmIEWzeMYnO0QXaSX2MzAtNbz2	Just try to think positive no matter what your doing and know that your thoughts aren’t you there just clouds surfacing your brain also that everything is going to get better 
7dmmIEWzeMYnO0QXaSX2MzAtNbz2	A couple days ago when I made a reddit to talk to other people and joining a discord server

7twv5EZA21XhwfyE2d8TfxeNwsr2	It's nothing specific. It's just Petty things like who actually did it who was mad first or who started arguing first?

7xJQdWsSRkeElgvYEsGlQ28ioX02	Nothing in particular just everyday things. 
7zZ6dI4fVrNZ7ivjK30gTqZ0NPA2	I never stopped I continue doing it today. 
7zZ6dI4fVrNZ7ivjK30gTqZ0NPA2	We would support one another while being in school together, but the goals we both have.  Doesn't allow us to go to school together. He's in Michigan right now for the Navy and I'm here. 
7zZ6dI4fVrNZ7ivjK30gTqZ0NPA2	Yeah, he left two days ago.  Right before Valentine's Day and my birthday which is made me feel very sad and alone, but also grew in my appreciation for the time. I got to spend. 
7zZ6dI4fVrNZ7ivjK30gTqZ0NPA2	We did find commonalities. 
7zZ6dI4fVrNZ7ivjK30gTqZ0NPA2	Yeah, the fact that my boyfriend left today. 
7zZ6dI4fVrNZ7ivjK30gTqZ0NPA2	I'm Japanese and white. I'm 19. My birthday is actually February 16th, which is this Sunday.  I like to read and write. I'm also very interested in music.  I am going into nursing right now in college.  And I want to be a nurse practitioner. 
7zZ6dI4fVrNZ7ivjK30gTqZ0NPA2	Not great. My boyfriend left for the Navy today and I won't be seeing him for at least a year or two. So 
7zZ6dI4fVrNZ7ivjK30gTqZ0NPA2	My heart hurts my brain runs through a lot of thoughts and I'm easily anxious. 
7zZ6dI4fVrNZ7ivjK30gTqZ0NPA2	I probably would have had a better day if my boyfriend didn't leave for the Navy today. So 
7zZ6dI4fVrNZ7ivjK30gTqZ0NPA2	Nothing really has changed besides my boyfriend leaving. I spent the last three weeks pretty much this house every day or everyday that I could I'm trying to spend as much time with him as I could but the biggest change it's going to be that I'm not going to be able to talk to him pretty much at all for the majority of the time. He's gone cuz he's going into the Navy so 
7zZ6dI4fVrNZ7ivjK30gTqZ0NPA2	I look forward to continuing through my school and hopefully getting to see my boyfriend this Christmas. 
7zZ6dI4fVrNZ7ivjK30gTqZ0NPA2	I don't even know to be honest. 
7zZ6dI4fVrNZ7ivjK30gTqZ0NPA2	I don't really know to be completely honest. 
7zZ6dI4fVrNZ7ivjK30gTqZ0NPA2	We love to watch.  movies in Netflix all cozying up in bed 
7zZ6dI4fVrNZ7ivjK30gTqZ0NPA2	I would love to go to Japan with him. He's always wanted to take me back to the country. My mom is from through the military.  he also  added that he wants to marry me at some point.  If we continue to feel the same way we do after he's out of his military stuff. 
7zZ6dI4fVrNZ7ivjK30gTqZ0NPA2	We do love each other. We both support each other whether it be with school or work or career.  aspirations  I support him in his dreams as he does the same for me when I would want to skip school to hang out with him more often. He would push me to continue School.  He and I both have issues of eating regularly and  I would push him to eat while he also did the same for me. 
7zZ6dI4fVrNZ7ivjK30gTqZ0NPA2	We support each other by motivating one another to continue with our education. I'm in college and he's in the military right now. He's going through basic training to be in the Navy but he is going to be in school with the Navy for about a year. 
7zZ6dI4fVrNZ7ivjK30gTqZ0NPA2	Right before he left about 2 or 3 weeks before he left for the Navy. He basically told me that he loved me and that he wanted to marry me.  So that I could never leave his side so that I would never be able to leave his side and I honestly at this point can't imagine being anywhere else but by his side. 
7zZ6dI4fVrNZ7ivjK30gTqZ0NPA2	He hasn't been single. He's with me or dating kind of I think that we're going to maybe take a break while he's gone. So.

7zZ6dI4fVrNZ7ivjK30gTqZ0NPA2	It's Valentine's Day and my birthday soon and my boyfriend left for the military 2 days before Valentine's Day. 
7zZ6dI4fVrNZ7ivjK30gTqZ0NPA2	It's Valentine's Day and my boyfriend is gone and I can't talk to him and my birthday is in two days.

82N18dIcuoeyi7zGhcAO7TixGGg2	I found out an hour before I had to come 
82N18dIcuoeyi7zGhcAO7TixGGg2	I’m the oldest sister of 7. I just had a son. He is 3 months old. I am a type one diabetic. I am a medical assistant at a back specialist office. I love coffee. I love going to church and reading the Bible. I have a boyfriend who I have been dating for about a year. My best friend is my sisters. I keep a very tight circle but I am friendly with everyone. 
82N18dIcuoeyi7zGhcAO7TixGGg2	I got up at a good tome and got my son ready for daycare. My boyfriend had sent the night. My boyfriend wasn’t to helpful in the morning but luckily he didn’t mess up my morning routine. Most of the ride to my sons daycare my boyfriend listened to music in his headphones. Which drives me crazy because I like to have conversations with him while we drive. I had to come into work a little earlier because one of the girls called out. My day was pretty smooth but I felt that I wasn’t moving fast enough because my manager was kind of rushing me. Now I’m at the walk in because I think I have a yeast infection 
82kVpTMedaReJjWgHISSRKxaMEZ2	I'm a Coqui Coqui. I'm happy. 
830LCqhJJCftHLKRtnggRHRzJjm2	right now  I just got off of work and like I get off Snapchat sign on my boyfriend want somebody to FaceTime him. I just want to know like why am I so upset about it? Like  I just feel like I'm not in a good place. I'm overweight.  I'm always tired. And then I just I don't take care of myself. Like I don't groom myself as much as I think I need to do personal hygiene as much as I need to like. What can I do to help all I do is work and come home. Like I haven't even washed clothes in months. I just need to get on track.  I'm done. 
83HRnT1LiYga8HwOQ6Ri8ucLVV53	I really screwed up over the weekend and Brian and I might break up over it. 
83HRnT1LiYga8HwOQ6Ri8ucLVV53	I am sad and I am hurt and I am scared.  And I am anxious.  What kind of emotions are you feeling today? Can you explain them to me? 
83Rvef3RogOJ0U0u1Kahtfsp8mD3	Just searching the App Store. 
83Rvef3RogOJ0U0u1Kahtfsp8mD3	I didn't do what I didn't want to do.  And I had Clarity on what I wanted to do. 
84TjkU5v2le6SuR7PU8EfF9iplW2	Being honest I didn’t really have any new ideas. I am still on my path of self love and confidence!
84TjkU5v2le6SuR7PU8EfF9iplW2	I was able to think about planning my day for tomorrow! Like how I would act, what I would wear, how I would play and think.
84TjkU5v2le6SuR7PU8EfF9iplW2	Realizing that I should be thankful for the things and opportunities to get stuff while others may not have the money or opportunity. 
84TjkU5v2le6SuR7PU8EfF9iplW2	Praying and talking to god about something bothering me and then seeing a miracle and sign happen right after I had asked him to answer that prayer 
84TjkU5v2le6SuR7PU8EfF9iplW2	I had an amazing experience with God and just felt relieved!
84TjkU5v2le6SuR7PU8EfF9iplW2	Well for starters, I was sick all day! I had to miss school and my basketball game. And I kept worrying about my game tomorrow because I have really bad anxiety about people judging me and stuff and I get very self conscious when I play. I constantly fear losing people I love. Also today, I had a ton of homework and was up until 12:00 doing it! I just want a break! Now I have to go back to school and deal with these teachers and students again!!
84TjkU5v2le6SuR7PU8EfF9iplW2	Yes I was, but I don’t feel very successful at completing them.
84TjkU5v2le6SuR7PU8EfF9iplW2	1-10; id say a 5. I was able to get some stuff done today but didn’t get to everything!
84TjkU5v2le6SuR7PU8EfF9iplW2	I have this boy on my mind and I think I like him. Problem is that he used to date on of my really good friends and I don’t want to hurt her. Plus there is this other kid that I am hood friends with and I don’t want to hurt him because he likes me. I don’t want to date this boy either though because I wasn’t gonna date till high school and because I feel like if I mess up the relationship, then we would never have the same friendship we have now.
84TjkU5v2le6SuR7PU8EfF9iplW2	Talk to friends and chill out/relax
84TjkU5v2le6SuR7PU8EfF9iplW2	Well today we left in the morning and went to the outlet mall up in Lotus Garden Georgia! I wasn’t very happy about it because I’m not one to go shopping everywhere. I ended up enjoying it though because I got some cute clothes and accessories! Then we went to a new restaurant called Smash-burger! It’s basically another version of five guys, but with more options!
84TjkU5v2le6SuR7PU8EfF9iplW2	I have been very thankful for my friends and family and the people I can trust/count on! I am also very thankful to have grown up in a Christian home so that I can have amazing parents leading me through the journey of Christ!
84TjkU5v2le6SuR7PU8EfF9iplW2	My friends and family, my relationship with God, and my relationship with the loved ones around me! I really felt down today, until I got this sudden urge to listen to Christian music! When I did, I felt safe and reassured with myself and my worth! I really felt like God was trying to tell me I shouldn’t listen to the people who hate on me and should really focus on what I think about myself and not what others think about me!
84TjkU5v2le6SuR7PU8EfF9iplW2	Knowing that my friends care about me and God has my back!
84TjkU5v2le6SuR7PU8EfF9iplW2	No! He was telling me to not listen to them! And move on! Focusing on me and my relationship with him and loved ones. Along with myself!
85UXwsNhubVlvegKwrqwy7NkYC33	I meant Paris, France. And I would like to see the Eiffel Tower
85UXwsNhubVlvegKwrqwy7NkYC33	Being a good actor pays off ok a bad way
85UXwsNhubVlvegKwrqwy7NkYC33	I have trust issues and I don’t really trust anyone right now besides my crush 
85UXwsNhubVlvegKwrqwy7NkYC33	What do you mean by how far back?
85UXwsNhubVlvegKwrqwy7NkYC33	No, she’s my best friend. And I’m not lesbian 
85UXwsNhubVlvegKwrqwy7NkYC33	Well, there could me someone problems but there wouldn’t be any drama or fights
85UXwsNhubVlvegKwrqwy7NkYC33	It was my younger brother but we just kinda did our own thing
85UXwsNhubVlvegKwrqwy7NkYC33	Just stayed at home with my younger brother today, did some chores, talked to some friends, and was on TikTok most of the day
85UXwsNhubVlvegKwrqwy7NkYC33	That my best friend makes fun of me too much and it’s kind of annoying 
85UXwsNhubVlvegKwrqwy7NkYC33	I would just tell her or him my name and just her to know each other over time
85UXwsNhubVlvegKwrqwy7NkYC33	Take a shower, sleep, and relax
85UXwsNhubVlvegKwrqwy7NkYC33	It’s 1 AM and I can’t sleep. I have school tomorrow and instead of sleeping I’m overthinking about all the sad things that could happen to me in life. It makes me want to cry.
85UXwsNhubVlvegKwrqwy7NkYC33	I only do it because of school
85UXwsNhubVlvegKwrqwy7NkYC33	Talking to Jericho or listening to music 
85UXwsNhubVlvegKwrqwy7NkYC33	The world would be overpopulated and there wouldn’t be enough food for all of us
85UXwsNhubVlvegKwrqwy7NkYC33	On Mondays to Fridays usually 6-7 hours and on Saturdays 10 hours and Sundays 8 hours 
85UXwsNhubVlvegKwrqwy7NkYC33	Well, usually I would just wake up and go to school, then after school, sometimes take the bus home other times my dad would pick me up. Then I would just do my homework, eat and sleep. That’s how my days usually goes. And there’s this boy... we’re really close friends and I had caught feelings for him about 1 year ago but my friends only think I liked him for 2 months. He found out about one and a half months ago because my boy best friend told him. My best friend said he liked me back. But he doesn’t really show that he likes me. So things are kind of weird between us because we still hang out everyday with our group of friends but it’s ok now. I just don’t know whether he likes me or not but if he doesn’t, it’s fine, I’ll move on someday, but if he does, I guess he’s just not ready for a relationship is neither am I or he’s just too nervously ask me out. But everything right now is ok between us. Then there’s my family...I don’t feel loved my my mom. I think she only cares for my younger brother. Besides that she always yells at me to clean my room that my younger brother messes up. And my parents fight a lot too so I don’t know what to do about that. And we might be moving but I really don’t want to. I want to stay where I’m at with my friends. And I guess that’s it.
85UXwsNhubVlvegKwrqwy7NkYC33	I want to have a better relationship with my friends that I have drama with and hopefully my parents would stop arguing a lot and maybe travel a bit and mover into a better house
85UXwsNhubVlvegKwrqwy7NkYC33	Sad, tired, annoyed, bored, stressed 
85UXwsNhubVlvegKwrqwy7NkYC33	I still have clean up my room a bit
85UXwsNhubVlvegKwrqwy7NkYC33	I have trust issues, family problems, and I guess thats all I can think of right now
85UXwsNhubVlvegKwrqwy7NkYC33	A lot of homework and love troubles
85UXwsNhubVlvegKwrqwy7NkYC33	Fighting and Defending myself so I wouldn’t be hurt 
85UXwsNhubVlvegKwrqwy7NkYC33	I would definitely travel to Paris, France with my closest friends, Gabe and his girlfriend Cheyanne, Jericho, Heida, and Matthew 
85UXwsNhubVlvegKwrqwy7NkYC33	Funny, scary, and adventurous couple
85UXwsNhubVlvegKwrqwy7NkYC33	I want it to be true and not fake, where we trust each other to tell each other everything  
85UXwsNhubVlvegKwrqwy7NkYC33	I may have but not noticed
85UXwsNhubVlvegKwrqwy7NkYC33	I’m not in a relationship 
85UXwsNhubVlvegKwrqwy7NkYC33	No, you should never to be fake. If you don’t like them just don’t date them
85UXwsNhubVlvegKwrqwy7NkYC33	There would be world peace, no wars, no homelessness, and no problems in the world at all. At least some of them
85UXwsNhubVlvegKwrqwy7NkYC33	It just sounds like a better future and even though I might not have all of that, it’ll happen over time, hopefully 
85UXwsNhubVlvegKwrqwy7NkYC33	Well, we’re not dating yet, so we don’t really have any
85UXwsNhubVlvegKwrqwy7NkYC33	He’s really funny, gives great advice, and he always cheers me up and brothers my fault when I see him
85UXwsNhubVlvegKwrqwy7NkYC33	Oh, I was just hoping that you could help me with my life, and I would just write down my problems in life
86NwkBCpeff1TcOYE3bmtOen2h13	Well I feel like I’m stuck

8HxXh3tguMR7tliwDz1Pot8lN682	I had a lot of negative thoughts.

8HxXh3tguMR7tliwDz1Pot8lN682	I just procrastinated a lot at work and didn't really get a whole lot done. 
8HxXh3tguMR7tliwDz1Pot8lN682	Like I said before I didn't get a lot done at work. I'm really tired and I didn't feel like doing anything so  I just spent my day procrastinating. 
8HxXh3tguMR7tliwDz1Pot8lN682	I don't really have any significant memories from my day. Had a really good dinner with my family tonight.  Other than that, it was just a regular day.

But at the same time like you can't get mad at me for going out here and taking somebody else's serious cuz I did see see but I didn't take CC that serious like me and CC whole thing was Niger flirting going to four.  But maybe I just never stopped it. I was even planning on liking Mo it my whole thing was if me and Taylor are not together by the end of November. I want to pop out with CeCe. I'm going to have to tell Taylor like this ain't working out. That's what I really was going to do you for me, but their homecoming happen, then I got fucked basically walked over and I'm talkin.  Niger you feel like the new thought I had today was like Taylor can't get mad if she gives literally gave me sign that she low-key didn't want to be on there. Like I wish I have a old iPhone so I can go back to the message. It was one time. I was saying she going to bother you my baby then she talked and she talked about not as you let me be free. I want I want to experience other things but I can't because it go get back to you. So like a new thought is like damn like what you mean is going to get back to me. So basically you saying  You still want to talk to me because you want to talk to other people or you only. Take me seriously trying to find another option or some shit. because

Online, what am I trying to say?  Like do God let this happen for a reason.  Sometimes I think about that.  Like the teasers let what happened on homecoming happen for a reason.  Over there just going to meet but then again everything happens for a reason and it was a learning experience for me and Taylor.  because  I'm not going to lie. It is some days I do remember this.  Like week before that me and Taylor really used to be on that like damn. I do really miss that girl. I don't know. Why why I never I never kissed.

This I want to say three whole weeks ago means. He's your friend on the phone and she told me name all the reasons you like me and I just sat there stuck do I don't really like her like I thought I did never really liked it from the get-go. But like dim, you know, I don't like me to give them like lies about yourself and what they want to hear but like was easy. I just couldn't make up a lie.  My day she was horrible to come up with some shit on the spot.  I want to see it like why was it that hard like all the other beaches like a lot of food, but that's easy. I just couldn't come up with a lie hard to believe.  To think that I actually like her.  And now I'm going to graduation where she want me to claim her, but I don't want to claim her and it's like damn.  If I don't do it and seeing her pregnant, like what am I going to do?  I don't want to put me on child support.  And then again, she don't know getting an abortion.  How many DM?  Honeywell always happen  Anyways, we all topic back to Taylor why you like it's something like should I go back? Should I stay at where I am, so I'll try to find somebody else.  Play me, like I love you thinking that like everyday like cuz after I let go Cc or drop CC.  I don't know. Who am I? How about next? I don't know if I'm going to go back to Taylor.

Imagine me if I can take off tonight with all my niggas and all her friend and they got to see in this is going to be in the back of my mind the whole time I use the bucket and the guy is a hydro. I just can't I just can't do it. Like maybe that should not even me like the goal was to come up this with you. I'm just going to fucking leave after her fucking Reno you for me. I'm going to fucking leave. I'm going to drop the good dick off and she's going to be stuck have to go to get Taylor stuck in for real.  Cuz at this point like rose I was working with her, but after that ship goes like no I can't fuck with it. I cannot fuck with it for real.  Yeah, but the goal is to fuck Taylor on Prom bet on the goal is to get a room. So I'm going to fuck. 
8KaaIMyxL3XPLmsGpHhmebe43gE3	Paramore, cuz once I found out that CeCe lied about being pregnant all I should went out the window, I didn't do not one homework assignment nothing. I got to get all that shit done.  In the morning at McDonald's or Somerset assume fans. Just just know that. 
8KaaIMyxL3XPLmsGpHhmebe43gE3	Family Friends School  work was awful. That's what I'm broke. 
8KaaIMyxL3XPLmsGpHhmebe43gE3	Got woken up to some bullshit this morning Sam room Apartments. It's going to be a problem. If it was like I didn't really fuck with her care about him like that mean his business on that for a year or so.  Why we didn't we wasn't even dating or none of that. We was just talkin friends when we supposed to become a relationship but things didn't go as planned. So we not together no more Bastille like Niger.  If that was the case, you didn't have to her to hold her. So now I was just sitting here thinking like damn. How long is his nickname plaid does this make a real life? Because since you're busy making told me I got to stop believing. 
8KaaIMyxL3XPLmsGpHhmebe43gE3	So like today semester finals happen and think I did pretty good tonight. Anyways, I ain't the point in the hallway. And this is one life in Grosse Ile in my class. I want to say give me my US government class for the past month. I think I'm not sure I know is that I had a feeling he was on the phone with me if I wouldn't really say she is but anyways today in the hallway me and Caesar walking out cuz we just got a ride from his older sister back up to the school and we just went to McDonald's. I want the fog. Anyways, we walking in the halls and then I see her I'll say Hey cuz like a mutual connection cuz we was just hanging me Tay Tay and her and Aubrey Lynn. Yeah. But would you calling me? All of us is just hanging on like Wednesday or Tuesday. So I don't remember. All I know is that we are chilling I said what's up and she still me I'm with you. Okay, thank you. I was I was thinking about getting a reply back, but then I'm like nah, you never know what I can leave too. But then I'm walking past unlike then I Told CJ Banks at IHOP on that he yeah, he said you miss 100% of the shots. You don't take me the same time. It's like damn. I'm already dealing with one female. I can barely handle cuz I'm leaving for real like I'm out of here. Indian I want him back but Niger miss taking too long and then she didn't want to walk me to Roberto's ever offer to get it to her so we can I get a second chance, but it's like my neighbor would like she didn't want to walk me. So I'm not going to force her or beg for it back by it is what it is.  Cuz at the end of the day we young look so if it's real we don't find each other again. And then she seemed pretty cool. So I don't want to mess that up. If I do end up turning off on that maybe after winter break are asking for a number or something.  but like  Oh no medicine. And then if I do end up if me and Hitler do in the parking again, it's like 3 minutes no too cuz it's easy not pregnant. I'm going but to move into any of the imagine if I get another one later on as we three and I'm in the same situation. I was just at when school start.  Senior been full of basically female problems. I told them life lessons with no female problems like tank now, she just can't catch a break. 
8KaaIMyxL3XPLmsGpHhmebe43gE3	book  today, I probably find out CeCe want some pregnant.  So that's good. But like then why so long like that?  I do believe her with light. I wish I would have left earlier because like what I see how could she play this was? So and expect me to stay like I'm going down the cigarette. So like I'm on the bigger and better things I might be on the nothing so you feel me like, I'm just ride the wave at this week.  I want them back, but it's like do I want to go back to that?  Cuz like it one point I don't even know if she wants to be with me. She was just playing this shit.  And then in another point is like everybody says she actually like me if she did like me would come on now. Like when we was on that I wasn't feeling that way like come on now, you can't throw mixed signals. Like when they're you got me feeling like you I think we'll be in a relationship then another day. It's like Bro Fuck this week's like what are we doing? Like I was tired of feeling like if that's what you want start old is easy, but now we're means you don't smoking and I'm going to come and grab me and tell me that I'm talkin cuz it's busy get around new friends and the Pink Lake City sitters on for not push it but like she's has been acting different something.  like it's need to get a hold of yourself and then  Another thing is I feel bad. Like I feel like I should have never told that many people about my situation cuz now my business all I know that our team if you like people to think what I want to think I should have never spoke up on me. I should have just kept my mouth goes about it. I would never told Tamil on kehlani any money situation.  And I was just told today.  I still be good.  Canal Taylor no white table tell me was never supposed to find out about the shit. Like what the fuck come on now.  But who the fuck I guess my name was brought up at a smoke session. It's somebody just blurt it out. Like bitch. What why?  Everything about it is this me said she didn't say it. But she said she's going to take one for the team and said she said it.  So now we talked about who saved it, but that's just like a lesson learned to like keep my mouth closed or whatever about my business or about what I'm going through.  Should I don't know I'm find some motivational quotes that go along with while you say one day wait on it. And then I had another heartbreak today.  Tell me why when glad you talked about.  Are we going with you and when we wearing and Destiny come out of nowhere saying not as you had it you was about to get a good so come to find out Taylor. Don't get a prom date with Taylor wanted to go to prom with me, but we can't cuz her mama said sew and I'm like damn.  That's all bad. I fucked up. So now I was like, damn do I want to go by myself or find another prom date or do I just want to suck it up and try to get Taylor back?  Because I don't know. I don't know. I don't figure this out soon. 
8KaaIMyxL3XPLmsGpHhmebe43gE3	I got the pie today at work if that's thankful and we should almost and I got to start showing emotion. 
8KaaIMyxL3XPLmsGpHhmebe43gE3	I'm going to be very thankful. Is CC not pregnant bro. Cuz if she not bro, I'm we so thankful and I'm Sorry Miss so I can leave so I can leave row CC is not worth it. It's not to be so real. 
8KaaIMyxL3XPLmsGpHhmebe43gE3	Nobody and I mean nobody.  nobody for real 
8KaaIMyxL3XPLmsGpHhmebe43gE3	Bro, the biggest challenge of today bro was accepting the fact that Taylor spoke with Aunt now, I really got to decide do I still want to cover or do I want to let that should go cuz you do me like I like I really like bro on some real shit. Like I mean, I'm not even feeling I always behold the feeling back and forth in front of everybody. But I really fucking Taylor you feeling like not not even or not. I don't love the pitch. He'll know that's it because of a little bit. She wouldn't go nowhere like this. Even if I fucked up you still coming back and type-c Bruno like love you. I really fuck with her from y'all. Hang on front Niger. I don't want to see it with nobody else cuz Niger now I shoot, New Jersey up from real. Like no the kid, I think that's my daddy.  You know my daddy. What was you calling yasu, New Jersey up for real?  I want to see it with nobody else. But yeah, that's why they don't have to pick up more stalling. I'll have to pick it up. When I get back to the house has the biggest challenge of the day except in the fact that his challenge is what you called when I do I want to cover or not. 
8KaaIMyxL3XPLmsGpHhmebe43gE3	Wisdom, cuz I could teach you Niger something. What type of Niger would I be if I don't practice what I preach?  Greatest words that A J.

Even though he's talking about but they got no a lot.  It be the ones you least expect.  A wise man can play a fool but a fool man can't play wise. 
8KaaIMyxL3XPLmsGpHhmebe43gE3	One thing I'm thankful for is.  Wife cuz it's plenty of times. I could have been gone. Like really didn't leave there was a time. I couldn't I was not about to leave c18 those Ruby a time. I was not about to live to see 18, and that's crazy. I literally just thought about that.  I would have been on the Peace Bridge or I would have been on a go fund me.  Dashie Prezi 
8KaaIMyxL3XPLmsGpHhmebe43gE3	I am making healthier decisions every day. 
8KaaIMyxL3XPLmsGpHhmebe43gE3	Because easy already have that higher level of intelligence. So it's easier dumb yourself down because you are you basically already know like  you can double yourself down easily this morning yourself up is hard. It's harder. I don't know what I was going to go. This is like a bunch of thoughts running through my head about this is like  when I was making play a fool because he knows how to play that part like it's not easy to tell you. It's not hard dumb yourself down just act act like you don't know what to talk about.  4 act like you don't know anything.

Find out on the next episode of Dragon Ball Z Kai. 
8KaaIMyxL3XPLmsGpHhmebe43gE3	It will be pretty good about 25. I should be a u.s. Marshal or firefighter one of the two living it up. Fuck another had his Bitches Only If I forgot my soulmate, I don't even know who that's going to be to be so real. I don't know if it's going to be like my high school thing Taylor and then we live to be high school sweethearts and sit or like After High School. We don't grow to smoke with each other. So it's like we'll just go our separate ways cuz like Don't know. But yeah, I'll be in the same place, but I'm just worried about how I'm going to do it at who is going to be with God. Damn. So it ain't going to be with the Dead.  Don't know about Taylor cuz her ass and bullshit. 
8KaaIMyxL3XPLmsGpHhmebe43gE3	I don't know to be real is like to be so 100 like  Would you call at 2 to be so real it's like to be someone to be so true, but I'm really going to do it.  Like this and I can't do it with CC no more like she's so dumb. She don't understand half. My fucking jokes like just earlier today.  Which car loan make the joke about how I'm so sick. I feel like I'm going to die, but CC don't see teachers.  Oh my God.  This is a mistake. 
8KaaIMyxL3XPLmsGpHhmebe43gE3	Today at work like when the last kid was getting picked up.  One of these little kids older sister.  Came and drop the pie off.  and it was Patti LaBelle on  everybody me gas in those saying it's good but it wasn't all that good when I tried it. So yeah. 
8KaaIMyxL3XPLmsGpHhmebe43gE3	because  you like sometimes I wonder what could have been.  What could have happened?  We have been farther cuz like I still remember it like that day before homecoming. She asked me to pull up the school early hunting it. Okay, nothing special when I have to think like owes, her mama probably want to see was he going to homecoming with  Put it in again. I'm glad I was late that morning. Cuz what happened on homecoming. It's like for my mom would probably beat my ass.  She probably told him she didn't probably she did tell him about the situation. So yeah, it's up now.  Oh, no.  The reason as to why are you feeling that way? You're just like a it's like the feeling of missing out on what could have been or when I lost.  Who's my best friend?  You never was you calling you never knew what you had Till It's Gone.  Yeah, some like that. 
8KaaIMyxL3XPLmsGpHhmebe43gE3	a single T Genesis car  and then what you call it?  I do today.  I was not going to be gone for fortnite really putting things on road really putting a lid in the head and I ain't talkin pencil think alike Road.

Nobody bothering me.  Madden Fun by myself. Only only knows you nobody else.  Cuz you know why it's not as he's Xbox. Not as he's not Jayden's not nobody else forgot mine. 
8KaaIMyxL3XPLmsGpHhmebe43gE3	Why is it that I'll be reminiscing like hor 2?  Like sometimes I can go a day without thinking about the situation that happened on homecoming or Taylor.  But then is like what I see relationships you on Instagram when I see freaky sent on Instagram. I'm like damn that could have been me and Taylor but they my phone wasn't on it is my fault.  Reminisce about that she like then.  What if I never come to CC?  Who knows what Taylor still be stringing me along at this point or will we have been in an actual relationship by now?  cuz like then  I don't know.  I feel in a Wonder In A Daze. That's how I'm feeling. 
8KaaIMyxL3XPLmsGpHhmebe43gE3	Because I'm mad nigga. What what you mean? Why would she want to go back to feeling it's probably a lot of factors probably a lot of things. She didn't tell me that she do like about me.  You probably never till now unless we get back on that or some butt.  Like would you call it?  Cuz like a couple weeks before her again homecoming maybe a month-and-a-half before.  Now I was saying mother for her ass. Don't talk about something. Let me go I feel trapped. I'm okay. She feels trapped over the letter ends up at school.  So I let her go like she want to be like Niger. What do you mean? I'm not going to hold you hostage or someone. You don't want to be in the already feel like a pin in the Friendship know it feel like a pending relationship.  People like a friendship more than the pending relationship.  So like Mega like what are we doing? We wasting time and seeing you. Are we going to do this or not?  Time is wasting like everybody has told me that.  Jemicy, she want to be with Ozzy and a female that don't want to be with I see Niger. I can give me a new bitch tomorrow. So I want to know cuz that's not who I want.  I want one girl, but I don't know if I want that's the pink.  So basically, I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place pray for nausea.

8LAiTazM1AaBBEll4wWM9my08k72	FL EZ FL like things I needed to say  but I kind of need that push. I need that push to get me to speak up and take my foot down the confidence thing, I guess. 
8LAiTazM1AaBBEll4wWM9my08k72	that's why I was asking a lot of  like putting my foot down and putting in that asserted Ness. I need to stop being so I need to stop being passive and I need to work on just  growing that confidence and growing that  I can tell people what I'm thinking and that's okay to tell what I'm thinking.

8LAiTazM1AaBBEll4wWM9my08k72	I'm feeling more positive going into talking with Christy tonight. 
8LAiTazM1AaBBEll4wWM9my08k72	putting so much pressure on Chris heater to not necessarily pressure pressure is the wrong word, but  maybe it is the fact that he feels like  don't tell the truth and I lie to her or that I  I lie about how I feel and that's not true. And she's my demeanor. It's not anything. I want her to keep personally. It's just it's just sometimes I don't have any really guilty because I know she wants to help and if she wants that support and motivation to change I feel guilty though. Sometimes I just don't know what to say her to give it to her. 
8LAiTazM1AaBBEll4wWM9my08k72	I don't want to change that all I really want to keep her by my side and I know she wants to stay by my side and I know everything that's going on in my life taking a toll on her. Actually. She feels helpless and I wish I could change that.

8LAiTazM1AaBBEll4wWM9my08k72	I don't know. What should be feeling grateful. I just know she she is just she loves waking me up. She loves talking with me. 
8LAiTazM1AaBBEll4wWM9my08k72	Well, it's not hard to talk to her after her class. She.  I just never know how long it's going to be until she calls because I would get excited. Sometimes it's hard to control my excitement.  But it's never hard to her. Sometimes when depending on how the class goes. She can be a little hard to talk to hard to get through to because she's upset or something happened or she's having just a depressed moment, I guess. 
8LAiTazM1AaBBEll4wWM9my08k72	I mean, honestly, there isn't really anything she needs to change. I mean we've talked and it's more like I got to change and now I need to change not her. 
8N8KhPRrivfrPhoa7laY3roxs982	I didn't make it to do list her today. So I'm no I didn't really get anything done. 
8N8KhPRrivfrPhoa7laY3roxs982	We did a lot of stuff we drove for like five and a half hours. So I got to play my game and then I got to see one of my friends and play with dog Jake. So yeah, and it was a whole bunch of other stuff. That was even more fun. 
8N8S0CMFDxTrX58CLXpoGjnazXG2	With my father two days ago. 
8N8S0CMFDxTrX58CLXpoGjnazXG2	In my room in bed, which could be bad sometimes but today it was actually kind of productive. 
8N8S0CMFDxTrX58CLXpoGjnazXG2	Adulthood and because I'm I think I'm old enough. 
8N8S0CMFDxTrX58CLXpoGjnazXG2	I'm able to be more productive and actually use things like my planner and I know books to keep me organized. 
8N8S0CMFDxTrX58CLXpoGjnazXG2	Taking a nap and then spending some time with my brother. 
8N8S0CMFDxTrX58CLXpoGjnazXG2	I would say about four out of five. I cleaned laundry and I didn't do all of it, but I didn't do it on purpose because I'm waiting on my brothers and I went ahead and started homework that I don't even have the start yet.  And I started sweating in my planner. 
8N8S0CMFDxTrX58CLXpoGjnazXG2	I woke up early. And then I  Did some laundry and then I was I am sick and I took a nap, but it's an app out and then I started so my homework.  And I only when I was hungry I drink water and then I was just able to sit down watch videos and relax a little bit. 
8N8S0CMFDxTrX58CLXpoGjnazXG2	Waking up so early.  Because I got to feel like the day was long and I got to do many things. 
8N8S0CMFDxTrX58CLXpoGjnazXG2	It made me feel like the day was longer and made me feel a little bit more productive. 
8N8S0CMFDxTrX58CLXpoGjnazXG2	Sometimes but not always. 
8PO9y8Top0fkifPwo0OzDJhionP2	 Not really. I’m just constantly scared of nearly everything.
8PO9y8Top0fkifPwo0OzDJhionP2	 I found it searching “diary” in the App Store
8PO9y8Top0fkifPwo0OzDJhionP2	 I contemplated the idea of actually getting my homework done.
8PO9y8Top0fkifPwo0OzDJhionP2	 Just a little tired and lonely. 
8PO9y8Top0fkifPwo0OzDJhionP2	" The earth
 Plants
 People
 My dog
My fish"
8PO9y8Top0fkifPwo0OzDJhionP2	 My mind won’t stop racing. Instead of sleeping I just lie awake in bed thinking.
8PO9y8Top0fkifPwo0OzDJhionP2	 My brother trying the nebulizer for the first time.
8PO9y8Top0fkifPwo0OzDJhionP2	 Math, that icecream is good, my dog is camel colored, how to plant, dinosaurs are cool
8PO9y8Top0fkifPwo0OzDJhionP2	 I don’t really exercise— I just walk a lot. And I carry heavy things most days.
8PO9y8Top0fkifPwo0OzDJhionP2	 I like to draw, or play with my dog.
8PO9y8Top0fkifPwo0OzDJhionP2	 I quite literally wake up, go to school, ride the bus home, then arrive home, do homework, and fall asleep. Then repeat the cycle. 
8PO9y8Top0fkifPwo0OzDJhionP2	 Not really, but then again I didn’t have a to do list.
8PO9y8Top0fkifPwo0OzDJhionP2	Not at that exact moment, but I have after that.
8PO9y8Top0fkifPwo0OzDJhionP2	 It was good— I spent a lot of time with my little brother today, and went to the store, and ate icecream 
8PO9y8Top0fkifPwo0OzDJhionP2	 I guess I generally lack friends and people to talk to, and that caused me to freak out about that and other things too
8PO9y8Top0fkifPwo0OzDJhionP2	 I was laying in bed, just waking up.

8VB7Qs5rviW5zrBYrWtFVAbHzoB2	Nothing particularly happy or sad happened. I was more on the sad side but I think that’s my neutral state nowadays so it just feels average
8VB7Qs5rviW5zrBYrWtFVAbHzoB2	Not really because I didn’t have much energy when I got home from school so I did the bare minimum homework
8VB7Qs5rviW5zrBYrWtFVAbHzoB2	I did homework, played video games for a little bit, and got inspired to start my self-improvement journey

8l0MfpoQuUeCC4n4ME2KFWkBh9I3	i’ve been tired, stressed out, and feeling a bit weird.. 
8l0MfpoQuUeCC4n4ME2KFWkBh9I3	im 17, usually happy but i can’t stand being alone i guess 
8l0MfpoQuUeCC4n4ME2KFWkBh9I3	im really looking forward to senior year and having a good summer 
8l0MfpoQuUeCC4n4ME2KFWkBh9I3	i get pretty lonely when i miss someone and just constantly need reassurance 
8l4DvZBoncWbUj2ZPxRBT7SacvQ2	I allow myself to be who I am without judgement 
8l4DvZBoncWbUj2ZPxRBT7SacvQ2	I choose to focus on the next step,not the entire path
8l4DvZBoncWbUj2ZPxRBT7SacvQ2	I can decide that my body is perfect,just the way it is
8l4DvZBoncWbUj2ZPxRBT7SacvQ2	The setting was at school with my crush 
8lhiTmZDP4OVzVhWsmDnCSrYX6T2	I don’t have a drinking problem. I have a problem with drinking the pain away. 
8lhiTmZDP4OVzVhWsmDnCSrYX6T2	I have been cheated on by all 3 of my husbands. Mikey, joe, and Devin. The last one was my ex boyfriend James. The day before thanksgiving I gave him $150 so he could go see his family in Savannah Tennessee. While he was there and I was visiting my grandparents in Ohio he cheated on me.
8lhiTmZDP4OVzVhWsmDnCSrYX6T2	I do miss him but I know I cannot put myself back in that situation. Drinking is one thing but I don’t want to become an alcoholic.
8lhiTmZDP4OVzVhWsmDnCSrYX6T2	The Saturday after thanksgiving weekend. 
8lhiTmZDP4OVzVhWsmDnCSrYX6T2	My mom, my dad, my sister, my kids dad, my ex boyfriend’s. A lot of people do. They come around when they need me and then when they get what they want from me they stop talking to me and forget I’m even here.
8lhiTmZDP4OVzVhWsmDnCSrYX6T2	Everywhere I go. I try my best to always make at least one person smile. My kids see it everywhere as well. They know I would give them my last breath of air.
8lhiTmZDP4OVzVhWsmDnCSrYX6T2	They call me. There is always a sad story as to why they need whatever it is they’re asking for. Because I know how it feels to be completely alone I try to take care of everyone else. I don’t even really know who I am.
8lhiTmZDP4OVzVhWsmDnCSrYX6T2	I don’t even know honestly. Do you have any ideas? 
8lhiTmZDP4OVzVhWsmDnCSrYX6T2	God, my children, and my pets. 
8lhiTmZDP4OVzVhWsmDnCSrYX6T2	I found it in the App Store for iPhone
8lhiTmZDP4OVzVhWsmDnCSrYX6T2	I think people perceive me as broken, lost, scared, and hurt.
8lhiTmZDP4OVzVhWsmDnCSrYX6T2	Today at work. Well I guess I didn’t really help her I tried to though. An elderly woman came in today needing her battery charged on her vehicle. However, she had to leave the car there and she said she couldn’t she wanted to warranty it out. We can’t do that though. We have to charge the battery for at least 24 hours before we can exchange it. She was highly upset. Her and both of my managers were so upset with each other. She sat in her car for a couple of hours and I felt awful but there was literally nothing I could do. Well I went to her car window and asked if she needed anything, I apologized for the way that my co workers had acted, and I just tried to talk her down so she wasn’t so upset. 
8lhiTmZDP4OVzVhWsmDnCSrYX6T2	Yes. All the time. When I graduated basic training from the Army I was depressed. My mom promised she would be there. Due to none of my family getting along with her I told everyone not to come so she could. She never showed up and I felt like yes, even though I did something with my life it was pointless because no one was there I was empty inside. I didn’t even go to my own graduation from medical assistant school because everyone said they couldn’t make it. The only people I have in my life consistently are my kids. I am so afraid that they’re going to leave me stranded too. 
8lhiTmZDP4OVzVhWsmDnCSrYX6T2	Everything. I’m terrified to fail and to let my kids down.
8lhiTmZDP4OVzVhWsmDnCSrYX6T2	Not at all. When James and I got together I was at a bar. It was just a fun night out nothing too crazy. However, as James and I continued dating I started drinking even more. I was in a really bad spot. Once he cheated on me I drank for 3 days straight. I was just trying to numb the pain. 
8lhiTmZDP4OVzVhWsmDnCSrYX6T2	I want to start getting up early again and doing my hair and makeup. I want to read my daily devotional. I want to continue doing a journal. I want to find quotes and poems that I can have read to me daily to keep my spirits up. I want to get my homework done and not procrastinate. I want to start smiling again. Even if I have to force it for now. It will be real again one day right? 
8lhiTmZDP4OVzVhWsmDnCSrYX6T2	I was hurting a little bit answering the questions. I found them easy to answer which is why it hurts. I hardly had anything positive to say and it just shows how messed up my life is right now. I just want to learn to be happy. 
8lhiTmZDP4OVzVhWsmDnCSrYX6T2	After James cheated on me I feel like I’m worthless. He has told me I’m worthless. I feel like I am ugly, fat, and dumb. I lost myself 
8lhiTmZDP4OVzVhWsmDnCSrYX6T2	Loving myself. I want to know who I am and I want to become my own supporter. This isn’t for just myself but my children as well. I don’t ever want them to look down on themselves like I have. I know there is more to me than I have seen. 
8lhiTmZDP4OVzVhWsmDnCSrYX6T2	I want my children to always remember me as the best mom ever. The one who did all she could to give them a better life. I want people to remember me as sweet, caring, and hardworking. I want to be the one who always made people smile. I want to be the one who always helped and did everything I could for anyone and everyone. 
8lhiTmZDP4OVzVhWsmDnCSrYX6T2	Respect, honesty, loyalty, consistency. When I’m not around and people talk about me they have enough of this values to protect my name and to tell the truth. 
8lhiTmZDP4OVzVhWsmDnCSrYX6T2	I’m not sure. I mean some people say they’re proud of me but then they say other things like I wish you would just find a man and settle down. My ex boyfriend James thought I was the worst person in the world. My mom doesn’t speak to me and I don’t speak to her. My Dad doesn’t say much at all. I don’t even know what he thinks. I think he just calls to make me feel better. My sisters are his pride and joy. The only positivity that I hear on a daily basis is my kids. They always tell me I’m the best mom ever, they love me, and they say they’ll never leave me.
8lhiTmZDP4OVzVhWsmDnCSrYX6T2	Yes!!! Very much so! I have so much doubt and fear that I don’t even live life hardly.
8lhiTmZDP4OVzVhWsmDnCSrYX6T2	Spiritually I know that I love God and I know that’s he sees everything I do. I stopped going to church and now I’m to embarrassed to go back. I fee like God may be disappointed in me. I wanted to get baptized but I got back into alcohol and then got scared. I don’t want to get saved just to let God down again. My kids are everything to me. I may not be the best mother but I would have no reason to live if I didn’t have them. They’re the only two people that give me hope. Financially I’m not very good right now. My hours at work got cut and my school pay got all messed up. 
8lhiTmZDP4OVzVhWsmDnCSrYX6T2	I’m smart, loving, and caring. I love working with animals especially livestock. Horses are my favorite animals. My kids are truly my number one love. 
8lhiTmZDP4OVzVhWsmDnCSrYX6T2	I have heard a lot of bad things about myself. My mom says I’m a drunk and a drug addict. She tells people that she is going to take my kids for literally no reason. My sister always talks and reminds people of how much better she is than me. My brother doesn’t even speak to me but my mom has convinced him that everything she says is true and he repeats what she says. My ex boyfriend james accuses me of being a whore and unfaithful. He was the one that cheated on me. 
8lhiTmZDP4OVzVhWsmDnCSrYX6T2	I’m kind of smart, I’m pretty when I try, I love fully, I have a good heart to others, I am caring,.....
8lhiTmZDP4OVzVhWsmDnCSrYX6T2	That I didn’t call my ex James. I have a tendency to call him when I’m lonely. It was very hard though. I became depressed because I just wanted to call him. He hurt me though I deserve more than that.
8lhiTmZDP4OVzVhWsmDnCSrYX6T2	Well I was born in Cincinnati Ohio but I only was born there my parents went back to Colorado because my Dad was in the Army. I claim Ludowici Georgia to be my home and so do my kids. It is the only place I have ever felt accepted and at home. I now live in Clarksville Tennessee.
8lhiTmZDP4OVzVhWsmDnCSrYX6T2	This is the hard part. I’m not ashamed of him. I miss him for some reason. Then again I’m not sure that I miss him or miss the good times.
8m6Um8vXMZhWJtkRMcJSjD6HCAK2	Look through the App Store. 
8m6Um8vXMZhWJtkRMcJSjD6HCAK2	Not many. I decided I liked this boy, and made a move. Also discovered how I feel about my father.
8m6Um8vXMZhWJtkRMcJSjD6HCAK2	Because I wanted to see a friend of mine, but she couldn’t because she was busy. I also had a bit of mental breakdown.
8m6Um8vXMZhWJtkRMcJSjD6HCAK2	I didn’t really have any goals, I can’t motivate myself enough to.
8m6Um8vXMZhWJtkRMcJSjD6HCAK2	Well, I don’t really know. My confidence has been unbelievably low lately. And I feel like I’m always relying on someone else to fix it. But I want to be independent. I also realized how critical my mother is, so it makes me antisocial, so much anxiety and what feels like depression. I don’t know what to do anymore.
8m6Um8vXMZhWJtkRMcJSjD6HCAK2	Not anything I can remember.
8m6Um8vXMZhWJtkRMcJSjD6HCAK2	Talking to a boy, Aiden. I never talk really because I’m really quiet, so I felt a little brave.
8m8wnqhOwVWGciyTvycAgZZ1kfq1	Being around so many other people at school is nerve-wracking for me and my social anxiety. There’s nothing like coming home and relaxing and focusing on only a nice peaceful game.
8m8wnqhOwVWGciyTvycAgZZ1kfq1	Nothing good happened, nothing bad happened. I suppose it was fine. I feel a bit stressed and anxious, as usual. I have to go back to school tomorrow.

9FfvvBj74ISKjOp1examIyFvKPA2	I did a lot of restaurant and Bartending for right now. I'm working for Sprint as a retail sales associate. 
9FfvvBj74ISKjOp1examIyFvKPA2	It was not bad. It was good. 
9FfvvBj74ISKjOp1examIyFvKPA2	Well, really most of my work has been in restaurants and Healthcare.  So not much business for the Sony my first type of business job. 
9FfvvBj74ISKjOp1examIyFvKPA2	Why do you want to do something in life?  I don't understand that question. 
9FfvvBj74ISKjOp1examIyFvKPA2	girl going nothing  I don't know.  slow interesting  shoot  Yeah, nothing mean my mind. So bottle of everyday life. I don't have time to just think about interesting things. I think about my stressors and I think about things I got to do and the things that I can't do anything that I want to do and things that I hope for I think about that kind of stuff all day. 
9FfvvBj74ISKjOp1examIyFvKPA2	My day was okay for the most part and then it kind of went down a little bit. Snooze deities and just being around my dad makes me uncomfortable and do all the things I have to do and work is nothing really happening very fast. And I know I have to have patience but it's just tough. I don't know like I don't have an outlet really. I don't have anyone I can only talk to my family because they don't understand. and they just judge and it's hard for me to open up to them because I would love to go to open up to them and tell them all My Success has and how happy I am and I wish that they could celebrate those things with me, but  they just they can't and they won't.  It makes me really sad.  Panthers miss my kids.  I want some butt.  I just want them all the time and then I can't have them all the time right now.  It's really tough. We have a lot of bills to pay.  I just feel like there's no end in sight trying to find a home and just seems like there is nothing that we can afford.  That takes dogs because we have to have our dog because otherwise he's going to go to some other home and I can't have that. That's my child.  I just I dwell on things and I stress about things that are out of my control like Corey. I can't always be with him and it scares me because I feel like if I'm not with him then he's going to use and and I guess that's just not a healthy way to be in a relationship. I have to give him that.  Space a benefit of a doubt but with the past and how things were in the past. It's really really hard to have that trust.  It's really hard.  And I'm just I just feel kind of like there's no end in sight and there's no way I'm just not like a tornado right now, and I just don't know where I'm going and it's just all over the place and I want stability and I want things to just go right without stress.  I know that's life, and I just have to learn how to deal with stress.  I'm not going to doing that but leaving got better when I call is Corey. He picks me up. You ain't got much better my mindset and got much better until I found something in the bathroom. That made me.  Question whether he's sober or not.  and I just put a pit in my stomach and I'm just  aloha  I just don't know how to handle that.  I want so badly to be sober and I'm going to stay sober but sometimes I don't really think that he can.  Or that he wants to.  I really really don't know if you wants it like I do.  I know he loves me and he wants us and in order to have us he has to be sober but there's just so many opportunities for him to  Use without my knowing.  And it's like that saying like if you did something and you knew you wouldn't get caught would you do it?  As an addict while yeah, we would.  Bulleya Sultan. I don't think he understands how much it hurts me to see.  So high to see him using and then on top of all that how badly it hurts me when he tells me something which I know is a lie, and it's right to my face when I just hate it. I just wish that he be honest with me all the time.  That's all for tonight. 
9FfvvBj74ISKjOp1examIyFvKPA2	I made a few phone calls.  I pick my kids up from school. I went to my first day of work. So that was really good.  And I got my kids birth certificates and their social security cards from the DS office. So I have all that and that's something I really needed to get done. 
9FfvvBj74ISKjOp1examIyFvKPA2	Relax, clean a car because we have a car organized our bills because we do have in it. 
9FfvvBj74ISKjOp1examIyFvKPA2	Yes, absolutely. My mom made pot roast with potatoes and carrots and it was really really delicious. 
9FfvvBj74ISKjOp1examIyFvKPA2	We need to clean our car and actually we needed to relax today because we are constantly going every single day. We never have a down day. 
9FfvvBj74ISKjOp1examIyFvKPA2	I feel you Leandria. How does a car organize itself after losing a bill? 
9FfvvBj74ISKjOp1examIyFvKPA2	Going to work at a place. I've never worked before in a type of business. I've never done before. So yeah, that's an accomplishment for me. 
9FuiSvjQOQMpO0isa4wg8DfSvn72	working out eating  getting their job done.  having a balanced lifestyle 
9FuiSvjQOQMpO0isa4wg8DfSvn72	Well, I just got sick and which typically I don't get so I don't know if I have been overworking myself.  The type of food I eat I suppose could be better and my workout routine is way too much cardio. I was probably need some strength training to get a stronger core. 
9FuiSvjQOQMpO0isa4wg8DfSvn72	most definitely summer  Are the days are longer?  since we live in the Northeast the weather is  comfortable to be outside and do a lot of physical activities sunny days really have an impact on my mood. 
9FuiSvjQOQMpO0isa4wg8DfSvn72	I have a couple of them. The first one is to put less stress on myself, especially when it comes to getting things done. I put self-imposed deadline, but you're very unrealistic and I have this personality trait where I am, very uncomfortable and Restless until a particular project is completed. So even though I may have two months to get it done. I have to get it done as quickly as possible and can necessarily take the two months that I have. Another resolution is To enjoy experiences more such as going to concerts or making little trips pretty much stopped doing all that. Once the kids came into my life. Another resolution is to go back to relearn some of my old skills, whether it's something like playing tennis or something like on doing SQL database queries, just feel like I've become a little stagnant. 
9FuiSvjQOQMpO0isa4wg8DfSvn72	I will achieve my New Year's resolution. 
9FuiSvjQOQMpO0isa4wg8DfSvn72	to have a healthier lifestyle 
9FuiSvjQOQMpO0isa4wg8DfSvn72	Now I kind of need most of them. 
9FuiSvjQOQMpO0isa4wg8DfSvn72	I'm embarrassed to say but binge walk watching Netflix with Tyler.  Unfortunately many times I end up falling asleep. 
9FuiSvjQOQMpO0isa4wg8DfSvn72	My recent trip into New York City to go see Lion King with my son Ryan. 
9FuiSvjQOQMpO0isa4wg8DfSvn72	Just enjoying life more and being a little more relaxed not always checking the time and being a little more spontaneous and not rigid and just going with the flow, which is definitely not my personality, but I'm going to give it a shot especially as I'm getting older. 
9FuiSvjQOQMpO0isa4wg8DfSvn72	Nothing can stop me from achieving success I desire. 
9FuiSvjQOQMpO0isa4wg8DfSvn72	In 20/20, I'll Focus my thoughts actions and emotions to create my best year yet. 
9FuiSvjQOQMpO0isa4wg8DfSvn72	Nothing spectacular happen the weather was kind of mild.  Gray  And I stayed home most of the day except for going to the gym in the morning. 
9FuiSvjQOQMpO0isa4wg8DfSvn72	The one about the self-imposed deadlines. I've already started and that's a gradual thing. It's going to be there's no definitive time when that ends it's going to be over time. But I've already started to realize changes in myself cuz I've been trying very hard as far as learning or we learning skills.  That's going to again be depending on if it's something like 10 is when the weather gets nice and if it's something like learning SQL again, you know, there's it's all dependent on other factors. And for the sequel It's really related to have Ryan's companies going. So that's it and the experiences are again going to be a gradual thing. No firm date. 
9FuiSvjQOQMpO0isa4wg8DfSvn72	People that are somewhat toxic and bring stress to my life. 
9FuiSvjQOQMpO0isa4wg8DfSvn72	I don't in fact, I have a tendency.  To do exactly what feels right to me, which many times is unorthodox or seams.  strange 2  my friends and family 
9FuiSvjQOQMpO0isa4wg8DfSvn72	Most definitely I exercise regularly and I eat pretty healthy. 
9FuiSvjQOQMpO0isa4wg8DfSvn72	Well the food I've been getting more and more healthy over the last couple of years.  As far as doing more strength training I suppose I have to go to other classes at my gym that offer.  strength training and less cardio 
9FuiSvjQOQMpO0isa4wg8DfSvn72	I've been staying on top of my tasks. I've been able to relax a little bit more as far as not constantly watching the clock and just taking my time getting things done and just trying to be a little more chill on my day-to-day Life Style. 
9FuiSvjQOQMpO0isa4wg8DfSvn72	Touch and improve as many lives as possible.  It could be in the smallest of ways or insignificant ways. 
9FuiSvjQOQMpO0isa4wg8DfSvn72	I am disciplined.  I have a high level of empathy for people.  I am very healthy as far as eating and exercising.  I'm very caring.  I can be very focused and goal-oriented. 
9FuiSvjQOQMpO0isa4wg8DfSvn72	My father was very disciplined.  and he was always able to  surpass all obstacles 
9FuiSvjQOQMpO0isa4wg8DfSvn72	I just have more time to reassess where I am and just really been focused on things. I want to do for my overall well-being and those are a couple of areas where I realized either something is causing me stress or something really brings me a lot of happiness or joy. 
9FuiSvjQOQMpO0isa4wg8DfSvn72	so today  I plan on catching up with work.  catching up with updating the Scrapbook  sending out thank-you letters to people who donated to Cheraw The Joy thief and playing around with in words. 
9FuiSvjQOQMpO0isa4wg8DfSvn72	So that I don't become old and complacent.  And not try new things. 
9FuiSvjQOQMpO0isa4wg8DfSvn72	I plan to shared with my husband because he will hopefully be joining me in some of the experiences or events that I want to attend. I will also be sharing them with my boy specially Ryan as he may have a bit of involvement with the the work-related stuff specifically the SQL stuff that I want to learn. 
9FuiSvjQOQMpO0isa4wg8DfSvn72	All the time it's worked out well for me.  During my 55 years.  every now and then  my instincts were wrong.  and it definitely has to do with  my faith in people 
9FuiSvjQOQMpO0isa4wg8DfSvn72	Following the theme of my last answer.  I'm the most happiest when I am helping others.

9HfejK6CdZfJLZW1E0U68dYA6a93	I'll try to think about it, but it's a lot of different things that you have to think about as well. 
9HfejK6CdZfJLZW1E0U68dYA6a93	That's a great question. I don't I don't think nobody I know is as open and understanding. 
9HfejK6CdZfJLZW1E0U68dYA6a93	I don't think I have an answer for that, but it's probably about 50 50. 
9HfejK6CdZfJLZW1E0U68dYA6a93	I don't really know what that is. Sorry. 
9HfejK6CdZfJLZW1E0U68dYA6a93	Yes, I strongly believe I could become an entrepreneur if I have the right tools. 
9HfejK6CdZfJLZW1E0U68dYA6a93	You know life just sometimes gets heavy.  And you just have you know, sometimes you have those moments where you just get coming down stuff not really going right.

9HfejK6CdZfJLZW1E0U68dYA6a93	It's okay. It could always be better. Just trying to stay positive. 
9HfejK6CdZfJLZW1E0U68dYA6a93	I like to do anything dealing with toning. 
9HfejK6CdZfJLZW1E0U68dYA6a93	I'll probably go out go dancing. I love to sing to. 
9HfejK6CdZfJLZW1E0U68dYA6a93	I believe I sleep probably too much. I'm not the type. That doesn't get any rest. I'm more of the type who decides to sleep more than usual. 
9HfejK6CdZfJLZW1E0U68dYA6a93	I've been spending my time at College. I've been spending my time with a person that I was supposed to be dating seen many people have been many places is just that a sometimes a points. You just need to rest or you just need to be alone, basically. So yeah. 
9HfejK6CdZfJLZW1E0U68dYA6a93	I'm experiencing Sadness the feeling of being lonely. 
9HfejK6CdZfJLZW1E0U68dYA6a93	I'm really excited because I really don't know what the future holds but I'm very excited to see what happens. 
9HfejK6CdZfJLZW1E0U68dYA6a93	I want to become an entrepreneur, but I haven't had the option or the finances to become one, but I will be one. 
9HfejK6CdZfJLZW1E0U68dYA6a93	I want to work on being so impulsive I want to work on trusting. I want to work on being more open and understanding. 
9HfejK6CdZfJLZW1E0U68dYA6a93	That's a great question. I don't really know the answer to it right now. Could you tell me what you couldn't live without? 
9HfejK6CdZfJLZW1E0U68dYA6a93	I would like to bring peace. I want to bring something to this world that is different something that everybody will know I was here or everybody knows. Oh, well Shamari did this so I know this will be something positive, but I don't really know what that could be. 
9HfejK6CdZfJLZW1E0U68dYA6a93	I couldn't live without old school R&B like I love Throwbacks. I love the 2019 like I loved I couldn't live without that music. 
9HfejK6CdZfJLZW1E0U68dYA6a93	I wouldn't even say that it is easy to bring peace to this world due to so much negativity that's already in it. But I mean once you start to bring peace, I'm pretty sure everything could go Copa steady. 
9HruwPiJ3QSdhsyfH8o1547aTuC3	to live in a perfect Paradise  where no one ever dies and no one ever gets sick. 
9HruwPiJ3QSdhsyfH8o1547aTuC3	Well in a perfect world there would be no such thing as money and wealth.  So in a perfect world everyone would get along and help each other.  And cooperate with each other. 
9HruwPiJ3QSdhsyfH8o1547aTuC3	She doesn't try to fix anything. She doesn't want to fix anything.  She wants everything to be her way. 
9HruwPiJ3QSdhsyfH8o1547aTuC3	I don't fight her. I try to fix everything.  By talking and working things out. 
9HruwPiJ3QSdhsyfH8o1547aTuC3	I don't know I think a week or so ago.  Work was pretty tough, but it wasn't because of work. It was because of my relationship with my wife.  and  my own mental  idiosyncrasies 
9HruwPiJ3QSdhsyfH8o1547aTuC3	I was looking for a app on my phone.  that  was a diary. I was just trying to keep a diary and this sounded intriguing because I  I've been having issues with my wife.  And it's making me feel insane. So I'm hoping  this app will help. 
9HruwPiJ3QSdhsyfH8o1547aTuC3	It's my time to acknowledge yet detach from this anger. 
9HruwPiJ3QSdhsyfH8o1547aTuC3	All I have is anger.  and  mean bad things to say  so I don't really want to say them.  I'm just going to try to distract myself from  all of this 
9HruwPiJ3QSdhsyfH8o1547aTuC3	I have the ability to stay calm even in difficult situations. 
9HruwPiJ3QSdhsyfH8o1547aTuC3	Yet again, that would be paradise. The Bible says that  We have a chance of living forever in a paradise Earth where no one ever dies. No one ever gets sick and it's a perfect scenario Perfect Situation. Perfect life.  It would be amazing. 
9HruwPiJ3QSdhsyfH8o1547aTuC3	I'm frustrated because  I have worked my whole life.  To be the best husband I can be.  Be the best man that I can be.  To do the best I can.  I prepared myself for  getting married by  Doing research on women and trying to understand women. So I've I've  made myself into this person that is willing to talk because I know women want to talk I've made myself into this person that  wants to fix things and the only way to fix things in a marriage is by talking.  And so I have done this my whole life.  Because I did not want to be in a position.  down the road where I  was in a marriage that I was unhappy with.  And I wanted to be the best husband I could be.  I wanted my wife to be happy. I wanted to be happy I wanted to do all the right things.  however  I have married a woman that thinks that she's the man in the relationship. She doesn't want to talk. She doesn't want to cooperate and work together to fix things.  She doesn't want.  Anything to do with that?  So now I feel like I am the woman in the relationship.  And she is the man.  Because I'm the one who wants to talk. I'm the one who wants to fix things.  and she doesn't  so I'm in the position that I prepared my entire life for.  But I didn't want to be in.  Even though I tried my hardest and did my best.  I know I'm in perfect and I'm going to make mistakes, so don't I don't expect.  perfection  I know there's going to be little things here and there.  However, I figured that I could talk through them. We can work out things.  But apparently I can't apparently.  I can't do that.  So I'm not just frustrated. I'm very very frustrated.  I'm done. 
9HruwPiJ3QSdhsyfH8o1547aTuC3	Right now I just want to be left alone.  Want to be in a quiet place where no one else is?  I want to escape.  everyone and everything  I want to take my mind off of all of it. 
9HruwPiJ3QSdhsyfH8o1547aTuC3	I don't know at this point.  I think talking about it does help. 
9HruwPiJ3QSdhsyfH8o1547aTuC3	I would change my wife into I guess my dream wife.  someone who I am not only physically but mentally attracted to  someone who is willing to  cooperate with me and  talk to me.  and  willing to be on the same team wanting to be on the same team wanting to help.  caring  and loving 
9HruwPiJ3QSdhsyfH8o1547aTuC3	Well, my day is pretty much over. I'm getting ready to go to bed and  My day was alright. It was a Friday and I worked and then a dinner with my in-laws and wife.  That's it. 
9HruwPiJ3QSdhsyfH8o1547aTuC3	I think the question is.  Why would anyone not want to live in a perfect situation?  .  That's the dream every single human being on the face of the Earth should have 
9HruwPiJ3QSdhsyfH8o1547aTuC3	Because the wife that I have now is not cooperative.  And she fights me on everything. 
9HruwPiJ3QSdhsyfH8o1547aTuC3	I think the best experience today was.  At work me and the guys at work all got along really good and I got a lot done today.  I think the camaraderie that we have at work is pretty good.  Everybody gets along. 
9HruwPiJ3QSdhsyfH8o1547aTuC3	On that question did not make any sense. 
9HruwPiJ3QSdhsyfH8o1547aTuC3	the forklift that we use today to  stack the steel.  Was very helpful because I didn't have to break my back lifting. 
9HruwPiJ3QSdhsyfH8o1547aTuC3	No, I don't. I feel like I worked and wasted my time today.  Because I had to work full-time and not pioneer.  Whenever I am out pioneering serving Jehovah, I feel like my time is well spent.  but working  I feel like it is wasted.

9Yc0P2aL7udP4zZegaAp1kX8B113	I would probably cut myself, write a song, draw, listen to music, or write about it in my journal 
9Yc0P2aL7udP4zZegaAp1kX8B113	There was no worse feeling 
9Yc0P2aL7udP4zZegaAp1kX8B113	No rude, he said he was going to steal me 
9Yc0P2aL7udP4zZegaAp1kX8B113	I am happy, I just want to grow old with him.
9Yc0P2aL7udP4zZegaAp1kX8B113	Lying about not talking to certain people 
9Yc0P2aL7udP4zZegaAp1kX8B113	We are comfortable with each other and nothing gets boring between us 
9Yc0P2aL7udP4zZegaAp1kX8B113	I was looking up diary’s in the App Store and it was recommended, I looked at the reviews and they were all positive; so I thought I’d give it a try.
9Yc0P2aL7udP4zZegaAp1kX8B113	What would have happened if I dated Skyler, or broke up with Chris.

9Yc0P2aL7udP4zZegaAp1kX8B113	Well we talked to our exes so it hurts us a lot 
9Yc0P2aL7udP4zZegaAp1kX8B113	A best friend who will always be by my side no matter what.
9Yc0P2aL7udP4zZegaAp1kX8B113	In our class in 7th grade, he asked me to sit with him in art class. We just kept talking, joking around and laughing

9Yc0P2aL7udP4zZegaAp1kX8B113	Yeeees, his humor. Some things he says. Some of his habits. 
9Yc0P2aL7udP4zZegaAp1kX8B113	No, the teacher let us sit anywhere at the time.
9Yc0P2aL7udP4zZegaAp1kX8B113	Shy, smart, outgoing, funny, cute and just amazing

9Yc0P2aL7udP4zZegaAp1kX8B113	His friends are nice, I don’t mind talking to them. But his one friend said really rude stuff to him 
9Yc0P2aL7udP4zZegaAp1kX8B113	Try to talk it out or talk to my best friend or someone I really trust 
9Yc0P2aL7udP4zZegaAp1kX8B113	That it won’t work out and he’ll go back to his ex or the girl he used to like 
9Yc0P2aL7udP4zZegaAp1kX8B113	His hugs and smile, basically him 
9Yc0P2aL7udP4zZegaAp1kX8B113	He makes me feel like I can do anything, he’s always pushing me to do better and saying I can do it :)
9Yc0P2aL7udP4zZegaAp1kX8B113	Cry, ignore it or talk to someone 
9Yc0P2aL7udP4zZegaAp1kX8B113	Say they would do anything for me 
9Yc0P2aL7udP4zZegaAp1kX8B113	He was funny and I felt safe 
9Yc0P2aL7udP4zZegaAp1kX8B113	It was our first date, we went to skate land. We decided to sit down for a break and I laid on his chest and decided to face him and just kiss him. He asked for another kiss and we just kept kissing. Then decided to take photos of us kissing :)
9Yc0P2aL7udP4zZegaAp1kX8B113	We both love to love each other 
9Yc0P2aL7udP4zZegaAp1kX8B113	I want them to forgive me for the past, and I want to forgive him for the past.
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I saw him dressed very  like  fancy and very Posh he had  circle glasses and he was bald.  And he was wearing like a top hat. And yeah I paid and he was wearing like this big fancy coat and light brown pants and a button-up shirt. He just looked very like  kind of mystical and fancy 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	my cousin  when we were younger, we were really good friends. We were inseparable. We went to Disneyland together. We went to each other's houses every weekend and we are just really really close but  After she left the church, she kind of her parents kind of turned her into a different person and now she's just very toxic and she's very mean without thinking that she's mean she's thinking that she's making the right decision that she's doing the right things. But reality is being really rude to everyone and  everyone  you know a lot of people that want to be around her because she's mean 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	Because my grandpa was there and he told me which ones I should get and which one should help me. So that's why I chose the back because he told me it would be the most helpful to me. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	molluscum doesn't  we found a app online or you could play it just online instead of having to be face-to-face with someone so that's nice. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	Well, we've been friends for 10 years. So basically our entire lives we met when we were three years old around 3. I was like around 4.  and  yeah, she came into my life at a really good time.  Because my brother had just been born and he was born with a life-threatening disease that kept in the hospital for two years, and she was just nine.  She's my friend. She became my friend do that whole time and of course our friendship wasn't perfect. It wasn't really a good friend to be there. We were always fighting.  But during the times that we weren't fighting we were having fun.  And then we stopped being friends for a while. He stopped being friends for about a year or two years and then  we were brought back together and we very quickly became best friends again.  And there have been a little bumps in the road. But right now everything has been going. Well, everything's been going steady for  couple of months 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	it didn't really describe it because that all happened so fast because the lights turned off and then there was a voice that said you have to pick three powers three two for yourself and one to give to somebody else and so he told me to pick the bat power and then a necklace with Cookie and I'm not sure what the cement but he just told me that those be the most beneficial for me and then  He told me to give him this staff. And so I just give him the stuff. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I do not know the answer to that question. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I do not know but in my dream he was a waiter, so he was there to serve us and talk with us and he was cool. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I  Want to go to Disneyland when it's hot?  So that I can wear shorts.  I guess I don't know. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	There are like, I think we'll there was one bad.  And I grabbed it but there are like hundreds of little things and each of them have the clear on special power. So whatever you pick but gave you your power like the invisible kid. He'll expect something that had to do with being invisible and that turned him invisible. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I do not know how to answer that question, but I want to go to Disneyland. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I'm stressed out about the show because there's a lot that I have to do and there's a lot that I have to remember.  And I'm also very scared of my director.  She scares me meme.  And the thought of Performing even though it excites me, it does still scare me because I want to do everything perfectly and if I make a mistake, and I'm going to beat myself up for it.  And there are there black there are also a lot of things and that happened in the show that I don't fully understand yet that like there are some dances that I don't really understand and don't really know what to do for them. But I'm too scared to ask what I'm supposed to do because again by director scares me and I'm scared that if I asked her how to do something she'll yell at me because I've seen her do that the other two other kids so I don't want to be one of those kids that gets yelled at by the director. So I'm just kind of trying to figure it out by myself. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I don't know. I just like we weren't doing well. Everyone kept messing up. One thing that I remember is that I was backstage during intermission.  I was more I was on the stage during intermission. So the curtains were closed and I was trying to get my car because she's back on and as I was putting my character shoes on the curtains opened and Ivanka just see me in the middle of the stage paint on my shoes.  Which was embarrassing that even though it didn't really happen, but it's embarrassing thinking about it.  Oh and also at one point in the show, my friend Ethan didn't show up for the boughs and so we didn't really know what to do. So you just kind of pretended he was there and pretended he was still bow and could even though he wasn't there. I don't know where he went. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	When you're tumbling like before you tumble, you have to stretch first leg stretch out your splits and switch out your legs and your arms and is due if you stretching exercises and it just really made me feel relaxed because my teacher but play relaxing music and it just made me feel then and my dad was doing some sort of meditation. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I don't know why he was there.  I don't.  I did kind of see him like in the rest of the dream.  But then after awhile, you kind of disappeared and I was like, oh, okay.  So I don't know why he was there maybe had something to do with it. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I was feeling pretty normal.  I felt like happy I felt normal.  I feel like a normal day. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I feel really really happy when I hang out with my family.  because they gave me more than anyone else even more than my friends and we are just  each other's people and we understand everything we have jokes and we have and we share memories and we have special little  memories that we share with each other  And it's just it feels really special.  and it's  something it's a feeling that I wouldn't change a trade for anything. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I guess so.  I mean  Yeah, I guess they could be a little bit.  Afraid people can be afraid of anything laudes. A lot of people have social anxiety. So  I guess so. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	Well, I'm fat in this day and age Society tells us that we should be that girl should have long pretty hair and big boobs and a big butt.  but not all girls have that and I don't girls want to look like that and  if people don't want to look like that and it's really easy for other people to judge them in to assume things about their life. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I don't know why the bats were there. I think oh I know so we had to choose.  The little things in the little things have magical powers. So you're choosing which Powers we had and so I guess the batroc meant that I would be able to turn into a bat like a vampire and then I don't know what the little key meant and I don't know what this document, but I know that I was able to turn into a bat. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	my brother was angry like he was  trying to fight me and you was like  trying to hit me and stuff.  Remember and my room and I tried to let go my mom or call someone but my phone like wasn't working. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I've been singing since I was little I always sing in the car and it always thing to Disney music.  and  This semester. I started taking I auditioned for the advanced choir at my school the advanced ladies choir and I got in so now I'm in advanced choir which  Kind of scares me just a little bit. It kind of gives me anxiety because I sent them in the advanced choir. I'm expected to know to know like how to do all these things like.  sight reading and no identification identification  and like  all about flats and Sharps and I don't really know about a lot of that stuff, but everyone else does so I feel a little bit like stupid that I don't know anything and I'm worried that people will judge me because I don't know things and I'm worried that people will think that I'm not qualified enough to be in the advanced choir because I don't know how to read sheet music.  So yeah. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I think  people would find it annoying and I don't think people would really understand how I feel and think that it's  Just something that can be fixed really easily. But and for them it might be so that they can fix easily. But for me, it's a lot harder.  and there's a lot more steps I have to take and  It's loss carrier. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	The worst president is probably.  after I hung out with my family, I just got really really sad out of nowhere and I just  kind of like turned off I guess.  And I just felt numb and I still do kind of feel like that because I'm kind of in that stage right now. I kind of just feel numb and I feel like  My mental health isn't worth fixing because it's already so messed up and it takes a lot of work to fix it. And I'm just too tired to deal with it because of already headed in it do it before and it was really really hard and I just don't think I can do it again. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I wouldn't choose to live forever.  Because you need to move on and if you live forever than you get to watch your friends and family die and watch life go on in progress.  And I would just rather.  Live it out while I can and then.  Die when I need to die.  I'm fine with that. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I want to go to Disneyland with my best friend Maddie, Maddie.  I also kind of want to go with Gentry but I feel like I would have a fun time with Maddie because we've both been there before we both know the ropes and also Maddie like school and thrill rides a lot more than she does know. She's kind of a check in when it comes to that kind of stuff. So I feel like I was just having a much better time with Maddie, but I would still love to go to gym with Gentry. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	My parents are members. So I kind of just grew up going to the church.  but after I  are you older and got to think for myself they gave me a decision if I wanted to keep going or if I wanted to stop going and I chose to keep going because there are so many instant instances in my life where the church is helps me and there just so many things that I can't explain.  Without email bringing in the church. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I feel happy when I hang out with them because  they  just lay in the mood.  and we've all been through so much, but we can  still  come up together at the end of the day and just talk and  and just have a fun time.  No matter how rough my day's been going. I can always count on my family is going to make it better.  And that they're going to lighten my mood and they're going to just bring.  Bring the whole day up and make it go from an okay day to a great day. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	a lot, but I'll need  five or so. Were you majoring? 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	Well, we need to talk to them.  Then I will but if there's if I have a choice not to then I usually won't.  but  yeah, I think I'm pretty awkward.  so  I can light. A conversation but a lot of time I'm talking with people who are also awkward and so it's hard for them to carry the conversation and so I can't really like  do you know it just  Turns into a whole math. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	Well, no one likes someone who is cocky.  So I don't want to be that person that's like, oh, I'm so great because I don't think I'm that great.  But I so want to get confident and believe that I'm great, you know. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	Sometimes I sleep good, but recently I've been having not good sleep. I've been  waking up in the middle of the night alive, and I've been having trouble getting to sleep tonight. I did not get good sleep because of the wind the wind was really loud. So it kept me up.  And I have to wake up early tonight today.  This morning. I don't know so.  when I woke up, there's no point in going back to sleep because  I don't want to get 30 minutes of sleep. So.  a kind of sex 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I didn't have to but it was fun. It's fun to FaceTime your friends and to talk to them and cards against Humanities fun game. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I'm currently in a toxic relationship with my cousin.  and  it's really hard for me to  confront her about the things that she does that makes me.  He'll bad.  So I want to  either build up the courage to confront her or I want to build up the courage to cut her out of my life.  But I'm not really sure how to do that. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	No.  I don't think anyone would be afraid of someone who is not qualified. I think people would.  bmore  have more Envy of someone who is not qualified.  I mean, I guess people can be afraid of someone who's not qualified because even if they're not qualified, they still might be better than them.  And if someone's had two years of experience in another person's had like a few weeks of experience and then  A person with a few weeks of experience is already better than them. I guess there is a reason to be scared of someone who is as qualified As You Are  But I'm I just I want to be qualified. I won't be able to think I'm qualified.  and  yeah. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I would rather live forever watching life go on. But even if I did that I would still see people died. So I would rather just do neither. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I didn't before because I just felt really sad and I  so a little bit guilty because I didn't go to church this morning, which is something that I usually do every week.  So I felt like they were disappointed in me that I didn't go.  and I've just been kind of  locking myself in my room all day.  ingest  being sad 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I would accept it and I would feel very grateful for it. But I would wonder why they're giving a present to me because if I don't like them.  There is a chance that they might not like me.  But I'm thinking of a specific person and if I received a gift from them and I don't particularly like them.  But if I did receive a gift from them, I would still be grateful and I would still say, thank you. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I don't know. I  I just  I don't know. I'm worried that people will judge me.  I don't know. I I really don't know why.  Feel anxious about going places because nothing bad has really ever happened.  so  I don't know. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I don't know. I don't think I don't think everyone is completely nice to themselves. And if they are I want to know how they do it.  I think everyone has a little bit of self criticizing in them. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	my brother  had  a disease  that  costume to be in the hospital for  two years because doctors thought he wasn't going to live until 2.  So they wanted to keep them in the hospital for a long time to monitor him and try to keep them alive. So it was really dark time in my life and I was  I never got to see my parents because they were always at the hospital with him and we weren't allowed to go see him because you were little kids me carry germs and he had to be  like a germ-free as possible. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	Alex theater because it's fun center.  get to perform and I really like to sing and dance and act and it's fun to just be honest age and have a lot of people like  you know admire you in like  hear what you have to say and it just makes me feel like I'm wanted and also it's a very social atmosphere.

We shouldn't do that and I am guilty of doing it one or two times and I need to work on that. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	At the beginning I was doing a dress rehearsal for my upcoming show Hello Dolly and I remember everything went wrong in the dress rehearsal.  and  I remember there being a lot of strobe lights and it was like a party more than a shell which is a little bit weird.

9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	The boy didn't really tell me about the power that he picked but my grandpa.  my grandpa  it seems like he was experiencing like what he's gone through this before so he  told me to pick.  The bat power and that would allow me to turn into a bat, but I didn't actually use it anywhere in the dream. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	It is easy.  But I guess I'm not very social. I have a hard time walking up to people and just you know.  Talking to them. So I always wait for people to come talk to me.  And yeah, it's something that I want to work on. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	Because it has a good storyline and I want to know what happens and I want to know how my grandpa knew so much about the powers and I want to know.  If I'll ever get to use my power, I want to know what the little key necklace pendant.  and  I want to hang out with the waiter dude again. He was pretty cool. And yeah. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	no, absolutely not cuz you don't know what that person is going through and  if  They're going through something really hard then one little thing. You say could really really really affect them.  So I think that you should just be nice and go out of your way to be nice to everyone you didn't you meet because again, you never know what that person is going through whatever you say can really impact them. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I do not know the answers to that, but I do know that my mom has very weird dreams.  I'm at Disneyland.  so  can I relate to that? 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I want to be seen as someone who is confident, but not cocky.  and who is good at what they do good out what I do, I guess and who can  Leave the group.  without being bossy  and just I want to be someone that Everyone likes I want to be loved by people. I want to be admired by people.  Yeah. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	It looked around 20 to 25. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	But the waiter.  he looks  a little bit younger than he looks now like in real life.  He look like he was about like 20-25 around that. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I think  people in my family because  they also don't really like this person.  And they're the only people that I know of that don't like this person.  So I think they would much.  More enjoy getting a gift from someone else then from them. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I usually go to church every week.  because I have  a lot of Duties that I need to do there  And I have a lot of meetings.  So I usually go every week but this morning I just felt really stressed about all the stuff that I had to do and I was just tired and I just really wasn't in the mood. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I don't know why but I remember laying in the bed and some paint. Well, it would be released. The spider called up right now and then a spider did and it was scary and I don't remember what I did after that. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	Tumbling made me feel really relaxed, but it also stressed me out because I was doing a lot of trip and I was really scared that I was going to fall.  But when we're doing our stretches was really relaxing. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	My family was in the dream my mom and my dad and my little brother and my cousin was also in the dream.  And I think that's it. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I think I need to.  start by learning  that  people find me prettier than I find myself.  people  like the way I look even though I don't like it.  Second the first step is to jest.  is how I  see my looks. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I think it's that people.  can guide you and  people that guide you and people who have lost.  Can still help guide me through life. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	ice rink  I am  not very good at showing my feelings.  I'm not very good at confrontation.  So people might think that I  M2  Judgy, I guess.  Like I'm very very sensitive. So some things that might not bother one bother one person could really bother me and  Actor something bothers me. It's hard for me to get over it and it's hard for me to confront that person feels something that they did that was wrong. So.  I think people might find that annoying about me.

It's  The weirdest dream ever had and it's the dream. I remember the most  so I don't remember what I was going through at that time, but I think I was on vacation. So I think that might have sparked the idea that I was at Disneyland because I remember waking up in time my dad about it in the hotel room.  But other than that, I have no idea what could have sparked that dream. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	Walt Disney because he is one of my Idols cuz he made Disney Land and doesn't understand my favorite places ever and I would just want to sit down with him and learn the process making Disneyland and then I'll be behind scenes and how the rides used to be.

9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I love when my friends are good listeners.  Cuz a lot of times I just need to vent to someone and I can always tell when someone doesn't really want to listen to me or it doesn't really care in that kind of makes me feel crappy. So having a good listener.  Is truly helpful and I have someone who's actually interested in what you're saying.  I like friends who are honest. I have a lot of I've had a lot of instances reference of lie to me about the things that now I completely understand if I have the time and I was very confused and very angry because I didn't understand why they were lying to me and why they couldn't just tell the truth.  I like friends that are humbled.  because I have very low self-esteem and  Can someone else be so confident?  kind of makes me feel like  I don't know it just I know they're not trying to do this, but it makes  It makes it look like there.  They think they're so much better than me, but I know that's probably a terrible thing to think but that's just how I feel.  I like friends who will.  Do things you know that they'll keep their word that that's a very big one.  I like friends that will keep their word.  And that when they say they're going to do something that they'll do it and when they say they're not going to do something and they won't do it.  And I like friends that are funny.  I am a funny person and if no one gets my jokes then  There's not there's not that much fun and hang out with someone because all I do is make jokes. So I need someone who will make jokes with me and that will get my jokes and laughs at my jokes make you laugh at their jokes. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	My cousin my mom my best friend my best friend's mom.  And some people from my ward.  and my brother 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	listen to remember that it's not my decision to make and  I'm still good about I'm still good, and I'm still  You know.  They're going to be other things for me to do. They are going to be other opportunities. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I think my relationship with my best friend has been going really well.  She makes me feel really happy and she hasn't done anything wrong in a really long time, which is good.  She has wronged me in any way for a while.  What any major way there have been some little things but of course nobody's perfect. So I think that's going well. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I like to do theater. I'm in a musical right now, and it's really fun.  I'm not very social.  And I am social but I only have like two really good friends, and I'm like three.  friends  And yeah.  Yeah, that that's it. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	Because I told her how I felt I knew she would get angry and defensive and then everyone else would think that I was just being a snobby brat and I don't want to look like on a Sunday. So I'm supporting her. I'm congratulating her but there still a little bit of like jealousy and me and I so wish that I could be in her shoes. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I  can sing I can dance I can act.  and  I'm decent-looking.  And I can play ukulele. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	one reason  is  I'm in a point in my life where I live.  Become very depressed and very anxious and very stressed.  And it's it's not a good point in my life. Another reason is that I'm in a  toxic relationship with someone that I used to be very close to.  And they still think that were super close. So it's hard to  deal with that and to try to adjust and to try to  and I'll build up the courage to confront them about all the things they've been doing.  and the reason is that  I  Want to be older?  I'm tired of being the edge that I am right now. I want to be able to drive and I want to get in high school. I want to get out of middle school and  Wants to do more grown up things, but you can't really do that when you're 14.  one reason I don't  Like where I am right now is that I am currently laying in my bed at 4:30 in the morning because I cannot sleep and I'm supposed to be up at 5. So I just got no sleep tonight and that's not the best. So I'm really tired right now, but apparently go back to sleep because I have to be up in 30 minutes. So  and last reason  I want to go to Disneyland.  I went in August.  And it was super super fun, but I'm already homesick for Disneyland and I'm just so ready to go back there. So I really wish that I was in California right now in a hotel waking up early to go to Disneyland with my family. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I'm going to remember that. I'm going to remember that everything is going to be okay.  And I'm just overthinking like I always do. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	Getting this app has sparked my happiness because I realized that I do I do need help.  and it's nice that I  have that help.  That having to spend any money and not having to leave my house. Just having an app. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I will always stand up for the things I believe in. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I will try to remind myself that.  Little bad things that happen or not the end of the world and that I can still make today great. Even if I don't get a great start to my morning or even if I don't go to go to breakfast. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	So the beginning lyrics doing a show for everything in the show about wrong went wrong.  And then after the show my mom took me and my best friend to my grandpa's house.  And we are just chilling there and then my cousin showed up.  and so me and my friend my cousin, we're just kind of  hanging out with each other and then I turned into like some princess.  And then like a mini version of Elsa that could fly took me to this neighborhood and then there was another fairy your two other fairies, but I don't remember what they look like or if I recognize them.  And we had to like solve this Mission. So we are looking through all the houses to work find evidence.  For this Mission and then we flew into a field.  And then the Carrie Elsa almost died somehow, but I don't remember how and then that was the end. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	So I was taking an ostrich egg over to my neighbor's but as I was carrying it, I broke it and then I felt really sad.  So then if I could do it again, but I still broke it the second time.  And then my some people from my ward came over. We're just kind of talking and then I was going to go to Lagoon with my best friend.  So I was in the car with my best friend my best friend's mom and some other people from my ward and we all got like a certain Man tickets and then they went in and  I don't remember actually riding the rise, but I know he went to Lagoon.  and then I kind of switch beers and I was at home and I was like  running from my brother. My brother was like really angry at me. So I was trying to run away from him and then I was laying in my bed and then the spider crawled up onto my bed.  And then that was it. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I'm thankful for my best friend, Maddie.  Maddie is such a good friend and I've grown up with her. We've came friends when we were three years old.  and we've grown up with each other and we've seen each other grow and Maddie's been through so much and she is  walked away from all that with a smile and she's just always has a positive attitude and she's funny and she listens to me.  And she just really wants the best for me which I really appreciate and you don't find a lot of people like that. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I'm really thankful for my mom.  She has a lot of things for me.  Even when it's hard to do things, she still pulls through and does them and thankful for my dad cuz he goes to work everyday and makes money for us and he's really funny and fun to be around. I'm thankful for my brother's there really fun to be around and they're really nice and they're funny and they really care for me and I'm thankful for my cat because he's sweet and kind and loving and super cute. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	Yes.  We had solo auditions for solo. We're doing in choir.  And I audition and I did really well.  But I did not get the solo someone else did.  And so I feel jealous. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I think  the best part of my day was  hanging out with my family.  At the end we were singing Schoolhouse Rock songs and just reliving memories. And that was really fun. It was fun to just chill with them. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	the best part of my day was  spending a little bit of time with my parents and watching a show with them for a little bit. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I facetimed my friends for a little bit and we played Cards Against Humanity which was which was really fun. I'm glad we got to do that. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I feel like the meaning was.  I was like scared of something that I'm scared of something and I'm trying to  just run away from it, but I need to learn to just deal with it.  I think that's why it's trying to tell me but I'm not sure. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I don't get how to meaning.  But it has kind of opened my eyes to how.  I'm feeling about my life right now. Like I'm very stressed out about the show that I'm doing.  And I'm not in a good spot with my cousin.  And yeah. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I think that I am very selfish.  I'm a very selfish person.  And I don't want people to know that I'm selfish because being selfish isn't very good personality trait and people often don't want to hang out with people that are selfish.  So I hope that no one finds out. I'm selfish.  I'm very sad. I'm sad a lot.  And I don't want people to know that I'm sad because I don't want them to worry about me and I don't want them to be upset because I'm upset.  I just want to deal with my problems by myself, and I don't want to put anyone into it. I don't want to make my problems their problems. I don't want them to feel like they're responsible for my feelings and how I feel.  I am dumb. I am very dumb.  I am not doing good in school.  I'm not as smart as I thought I was which is kind of sad and I wish I was smarter, but I just have to accept that. I'm not I'm really not that smart. But that is okay.  Update you.  Had on for a second, but then it kind of disappeared.  I am very nerdy which is something I don't like to admit.  I often wake up little stories in my head.  Really stupid dramatic stories, but they're fun for me, too.  Makeup and tell myself it gives me something to do.  But I really have been on friends that out because it's embarrassing.  See the last thing.  I  Let's see. This is a lot harder than I thought it was going to be.  I'm not as confident.  as I think I  You know show myself to be.  I am a very low self-esteem and I  and I don't  I don't think people know that I have low self-esteem because I don't really show it I often.  Chess how I want, you know, I dress very confidently I try to ask for a confident confident. I should look for a confident, but in reality, I'm not I'm not confident at all. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I guess just having my brother-in-law Hospital.  Was just a really hard thing for everyone to understand especially for me and my brothers to understand.  That people can be mean sometimes.  And it's not just because they want to be minutes because they feel like you're going through something.  And most of the time they're not trying to be mean.  But not everyone is a good person.  Anna goes with the people. Just want to be mean  there are some really bad people out there.  And I didn't really understand that.  That my parents didn't have all the time in the world for me. They have other responsibilities that they need to take care of.  oh that my  that I was the whole babysitting situation on Grissom was in the hospital without was  that whole thing was just really hard for me to understand. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I think people think.  That I'm just mediocre.  That I'm not like a super cool person, but I'm also not just like super planned.  I think people think I'm weird and one of the weird kids who just sits by themselves.  I feel like people think.  Did I am not social?  I feel like people who may feel bad for me because I'm not.  Because I'm not like them and not as fun as nice as they are.  and  I think that people I know like better but not like super super. Well may think that I'm annoying and clingy.  I hope they don't.  but  pay my 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	Today I step towards becoming a person that thinks big and takes decisive actions. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	Today, I'll be more honest with myself. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	Just because things didn't go your way.  You're still amazing. You're still.  Good, you're still probably better than they are. Let's be honest.  and  you can be the bigger person and not be proud about it. You can just get over it because it's just one little thing and you'll have many other opportunities like this or friendships or anything in your lifetime. You're still young found. It isn't the end of the world. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I took not with my family.  They always make me feel better and they always  are happy and funny.  we have to bring v a 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I want to feel like I'm included and usually I do feel like I'm included but every so often.  my phone's will just acts like I'm not even there and we'll just like  chilling do their own thing. It's more specifically with this one friend.  and the other friend tries to get me in it and tries to  Include me.  But my other friend just doesn't care until it makes me not even want to.  You know given because I'm frustrated and I want to show that I'm frustrated, but I also don't want to be like I'm mad at you.  And it frustrates me when they make a mess and not want to clean it up because this is my room. This is my house. I invited them over to  And they made a mess.  They messed up my bed. And so now I have to remake my bed and refold my throw blanket and  all that stuff  It's frustrating when my parents.  just  don't really I don't know like I get that they are also like stressed and frustrated.  but like  I don't know.  It's just I'm just being sensitive that I'm just being too sensitive. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I think that would be exhausting.  We will deal with overpopulation and the world will be so much different than it was right now.  And I think we'll just be exhausting to live forever. I think there has to be a point in everyone's life or you die.  So I wouldn't personally want to live in a world like that, but other people might 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	Put that would be a nice world to live in.  You'll never got sick.  I still believe that people needed needed needed to die at some point, but  Just like normal sickness like a cold or flu. If no, I never got that kind of sick. Then that would be awesome. And I would want that. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I don't really know how a flat Earth what effects mean.  But I'm sure it would be different.  And how it is right now.  But I know that the Earth is not flat.  And I think that flat-earthers are a little bit crazy, but that is okay. We all have our beliefs. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	Right now I'm stressed because I can't sleep because the wind is so loud that it's wake me up and it's not allowing me to fall asleep again.  I'm stressed because I don't want to be tired all day and I just want to fall asleep, but I can't and I have to get up in like an hour or so. I just got no sleep tonight. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I think my grandpa be in there.  And kind of helping guide me.  through  a weird situation is strange situation.  But now that I'm thinking about it.  It's like a really stands out to me and it's damn. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	Me and my family are planning on going to Disneyland.  around the end of June  and I just love Disneyland because it has so many memories and it's just so much fun and we might be going with my cousins and last time we went we went with my cousins and it was such a fun time. So I really hope that we get to do that again. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I think the majority of my attention was focused on my friends today.  Because I was kind of been hanging out and talking with them the entire day even after they left my house. I still called them and FaceTime them and hang out with him and you can before they came to my house. We were still calling and talking. So I think I was just putting putting a lot of my focus into them. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	This morning. I am feeling grateful for my cat.  because he is very loving and he came and  slept with me last night for a little bit when I was feeling anxious.  sound  grateful for that

9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I'm thankful that I get to hang out with my friends. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	One thing about the dream that is weird.  Is how much it's stuck with me? Because most rooms I have they don't really stay with me and like after like a year or two.  At this point that stay with me the most after a year or two. I forget them and mother's dreams. I forget like  You know the day after I have them but it's weird how much the stream is stuck with me.  And it's weird to think that I was at a point in my life where I still had a good relationship with my cousin.  Because we were very close and I have this dream and in the dream we were still very close.  But a lot of things have changed and it's just weird how much he's changed and how much she's changed.  Yeah, it's just weird how much it's stuck with me. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I guess I'm just feeling a little bit anxious.  to go to school  because I have social anxiety.  So being around people kind of scares me. But when I go look when I get there and I feel fine and I always end up having a good time. So I don't even know why I'm feeling anxious about it right now.  I'm also just upset that I didn't get any sleep last night.  And I'm tired. I'm really tired and I really want to get sleep and I'm debating if I should make my bed or if I should come home and take a nap.  But I don't know.

9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	The most important thing I would like to you to know about me is that I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I remember we were in this bedroom and we are all told us to pick little objects that they had in each object that gave you a power. So whichever you pick it would like if you the power to that object like corresponds with so my grandpa was there and apparently he was like an expert at this so he told me which ones to pick.  But tell me which ones would be beneficial for me. So I picked those.  And then we went to the dinner table and this waiter was sitting next to me and he was like the weather for the entire like table party thing and then he came with me to go take off my shoes and we are just going to like joking around with each other. He was a lot older than me and then I asked him about this wardrobe that had something written on it. It said something like  Said something about these two boys having magical powers, so I asked him about it and he told kind of what it was about but not really.  And then there is there is this kid there was this boy and he chose a power that was like invisibility. So he was invisible but you can still see he like his clothes and you could see if you could kind of see it like his hands but like he looks like a ghost  and so you couldn't like move that move his bowl because his hand just went right through it, but you can't touch fabric. So I helped him by putting in like a napkin over the bowl so he could move the ball.  And yeah. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	the orphanage  that movie  that movie in Paxton me.  Bohemian Rhapsody  am I love queen and I love all their songs and I have for a really long time.

I went to see it with my best friend and it was one of the funnest nights ever seen with Bohemian Rhapsody the whole the whole process of seeing that movie was a doozy.  Steve  oh a little princess that movie made me cry so much, but it's such a good movie.  It's one of my favorites.  And I didn't Toy Story 4.  I don't know what it is about that movie. It's not even that sad but I don't really cry at sad things and movies are usually cry at like happy reunions. And there's a lot of that Owen good-byes. Goodbyes. Make me cry and there's a lot of hype reunions and goodbyes and Toy Story 4 so that movie kind of destroyed me.  But it was good time. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	d23 Expo in California  the opening of some Disney attraction  I don't really care which one it is. I just want to go to an opening of an interaction.

Gerlach Halloween's in they do at Lagoon every year in the fall.  I want to go there with Maddie.  That's really all I can think of.  Not really a lot of events.

9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	It felt very confusing.  I'm just not really sure like  What mean it's supposed to have or even if it's supposed to have a meeting at all?  So yeah, it was just very weird. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I feel  silly at the gym. The gym makes me laugh because so many strange things happened.  And it's also cool.  So many things that I'm struggling with right now, I was still struggling with in the dream.  So it's kind of weird that my fears and you know, my feelings kind of morphed.  their way into a dream 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I acknowledge how I felt.  I acknowledge my feelings and I  try to make myself feel better and I tried to do things. That would make me feel better. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I was  at my house for most of it then I went outside my house and then I was at  Lagoon 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	At the beginning it took place in a theater room.  And then it morphed into my grandpa's house and then it morphed into a neighborhood and then it morphed until like a field. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	Yes, I am very self-conscious of what people think of me and I always overthink everything and watch everything I say.  because if I don't and I end up saying something stupid then it  stays with me for the entire day and kind of puts me in a bad mood and I want people to think that I'm a good person and that I  now has  Good attributes, and I'm not dumb and stupid. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	Yes, and no.  Mostly, yes, but there are a few little things.  that I  don't want in my future.  But it's really hard for me to change them. And I'm so trying to change them before it's too late.  butts  for most things  I'm happy with the direction. My life is going.  But there are a few little things that I want to change. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I feel like I spend my money too often on things that don't really matter like fast food or  So that's your stuff like that.  but it's hard because  when I go out with my friends, that's the only funny thing we can find to do. There are other things that are still fun, but that to us is the funnest. So that's what we enjoy most.  But it's not really good for us because we're spending so much money every time we hang out. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	Probably doing the dishes.  and doing school 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I want to  try not to say one bad thing about myself.  Pretty entire week.  Going to be hard.  But I'm going to try. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	Add beginning of the dream.  what this whole dream takes place at  a weird version of Disneyland  by the beginning of the dream me and my cousin were getting off of Splash Mountain. But after you got off you had to walk through it to walk on this leg rope bridge and on the Rope Bridge there is a bunch of kids who were like crying and pushing each other and it was very crowded. So we like had to squeeze through  And then we played some carnival games and then we went on a weird ride. That was like a roller coaster.  but it was very is very deceiving because the front of it looks like  the right small world, but it was called A Bug's Life ride, but the ride was actually about Finding Nemo which was really strange and you would go into these little orbs that were full of water and fish and would make it so you could breathe underwater somehow which was cool. And after the roller coaster there was a guy a water park outside. And for some reason it was mandatory that you had to ride this tiny little water slide after the ride.  And then I went on a train with my dad my brother and my cousin and then my cousin turn into a weird carrot remote and that was the end. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I was grateful to be able to have fun with my friends. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	My mom makes this really good spaghetti sauce.  That we have with pasta.  And she doesn't really cook dinner that often.  Because she has a disease that makes her really tired all the time. So it's hard for her to get up and do things so sometimes you don't have dinner.  but I'm just always really thankful when she gets up and when she takes the time to make a really  Nice and yummy dinner and it was really good. It's one of my favorite dinners that she's ever made.  Yeah, I'm just thankful that I'm stink for everything. She does for me and for my family. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	the first one  Even though I'm aware that I do, but I'm not that nice to myself. It was still hard to.  listen to myself say those things and it really opened my eyes of  how much I need to improve and how I shouldn't be mean to myself.  and it really opened my eyes to see how  much peoples were too affected mean and how things that people have said.  Marvin tell things that I hate about myself 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	My anxiety isn't comfortable, but I'm in charge and know how to handle it. My anxiety isn't too comfortable, but I'm in charge and know how to handle it.

I know it's just me being overly sensitive.  But it is still kind of annoying when they don't want to clean up the mess that they made because they just don't want to or there.  Watching Tik tok's or whatever. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I guess I don't fully believe that what I said was that accurate?  I do believe that people think that I am nice and that I do think that people like me.  But I still feel like that I'm annoying.  No, no.  I still feel like that. I'm annoying and that I'm not as popular.  And I'm weird and I'm not like the other kids.

They gave me so many lessons in one day and it's just very overwhelming to have to tackle them all.  and  I am worried about my grades and worried about getting good grades.  And it's just not fun.  It's not fun to sit around and do school for hours.

I do often critic myself on things.  and then  I feel insecurities.  that I  point out to myself and I tell myself that people are noticing them no more than  they actually are.  I definitely I definitely think I could be nicer to myself. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	because  I've been having a hard time recently these past couple of days have been hard.  I've been going through a lot of mood swings.  And it's nice to just get all my feelings out.  and to answer questions  and an excited to use this app everyday.

9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I tried to remind others that.

9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	It's hard to be a mom.  There's a lot of responsibilities that come with being a mom.  And my mom has extra challenges that she has on top of being a mom. So watching her overcome those challenges and facing them head-on everyday. Is there any inspiring?  And I'm very grateful that she still has time for me, even though she has a lot on her plate.

9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	Drunk on Halloween by wallows has been stuck in my head and also Fool by cavetown those two songs are my favorite right now, and I've been listening to them on repeat. So they've been stuck in my head a lot.  I've also had a lot of my songs that I'm learning in choir stuck in my head, which is good so that I can practice them at home.  India 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I said that because  we can't just live forever cuz that made a deal with overpopulation and I don't want to deal with that. So I'd rather just have everyone died naturally.  I sound like a crazy person, but it's fine. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	My cousin is not a not a good friend. She  she lets me down a lot of the time and she makes me feel like  I'm not as good as her.  And she is just really rude.  But I don't really know how to.  Deal with it. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	when I  Notice something about someone and want to compliment them. I'm just going to do it. I'm not going to hold back. I'm just going to  not think about anything and just do it. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	Not very often.  but  every once in awhile  I  well by someone a treat or a present and I think that matters because  It's nice to show your appreciation appreciation for someone with a little tree or anything really and it's it feels really good to give something to someone than to receive something so.  Yeah. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I love Disney and  just having something that relates to Disney on my body. I think would be really cool and especially having a on my wrist if I were to go do it and get a tattoo. I would want it to be on my wrist because I feel like that's a cute spot as it makes me look like some kind of biker chick. It just looks cute and it's minimalistic and just yeah, that's what I would want. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I don't regret it. I really don't I'm glad that I didn't get into it because  I found something that I love so much more than anything but guy got into theater.  And I know that I wouldn't enjoy that. I enjoy Cedar much more than any sports are dancing or tumbling or anything. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I don't really remember. I think we might have gone to Disneyland because we go to Disneyland a lot and that's  you know, that's the most enjoyable vacation spot for us.  But we did have one vacation where we went to California and we went to a bunch of different locations in California. So it might have been there too. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I can make myself some hot chocolate.  So that I have a little something to snack on while I do my work. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I want to try to ignore those feelings and just try to fit over it.  But it is going to be hard when I'm performing with her.  her  competitions in concerts in the next few months 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I feel that I'm coming from a  yeah, I am jealous, but I'm also worried that she's going to mess up.  Because she doesn't do well in front of audiences and there's going to be a big audiences audience and reforming the song like three times. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	What I want how I want to lose that I want to.  Be daring and you need things but it's kind of hard to do that when you're young and you're stuck in your household. Are you can't drive? That's why I'm really excited to turn 16 and get my license and  drive around and do anything within  Travel with my friends need my friends really want to go to Disneyland together and take a little road trip down to California.  That sound be super fun. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	The thing that she got is a solo in a choir.  So we're singing the song and at one point she has a solo the solo that I wanted and thought I was going to get  and I'm just really nervous that she's going to make us look bad because she can't do well in front of audiences and we're performing the song like three times in like some competitions in the next couple months.  And I just really don't want her to make us look bad because she froze up and couldn't sing her solo. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	Well ever since I started.  Doing school online instead of actually going to school.  I have I have to be more.  like I create my own hours, so I have to  be smart about it and I have to  You know remember to do it and there's not a teacher telling me that I have to do it. I have to decide that on my own.  Yeah, I'm so ever since I started it's been hard to find motivation to do it. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	Disneyland is set it hold a special place in my heart. So I tried to go as much as I can.  but  dance, sometimes you don't get to go but when we do get to go it's a really fun time and it really brings my family together and  it's nice to have be stuck with your family in California for a week because we don't really we do hang out with each other at home, but we  Megan even closer Bond when we're on vacation 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	Get some sleep.  Let's hope I get some sleep tonight because that would be really nice.  I'm going to kind of bases over yesterday because  Attendance for 4:15 a.m. In the morning  Yesterday I was really depressed and I stayed in my room all day and my PJs and a chunk.  So I think getting dressed getting out of the house.  being social  I think that would really help me because send you a mold and in junk wasn't the best in Ladue. I kind of regret it now, but it's what happened.  Siam 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	Someone got something that I really wanted and I don't really understand.  why she got it and I didn't so I'm just frustrated because I know that I could do so much better than her at the stank not sound snobby, but  it's more tailored to my skills and it is to hers and I just don't understand how she got it and I'm frustrated about it. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	It's frustrating when you have to really good friends.  But sometimes they spend.  they  and word attention on each other instead of  all three of you together  And it's frustrating when your friends come over and make a mess and then don't want to help you clean it up even though you ask.  and  frustrated when you're  parents get angry at you for stupid things.  Even though they're not trying to be angry they still.  Devices angry tone and it just makes me feel like I have failed. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I can.  Not be stressed about little things.  You can just relax. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	Feeling thankful for my mom because she is always doing good things for me and I love her very much. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	Okay, so my dream started.  I was in a big room with a bunch of other people and it was like we were looking at a museum of a bunch of little things and they were like some necklaces or some staffs. They're like bats like little toy bats.  Well, not really cause more like rocks I go outside or in the shapes of bats and there's a bunch of like cool mist mysterious things like that and we are all it was a very Victorian Room.  So we're all looking at these things and then we hear someone say, okay now you have to pick two of these items.  And then you have to wine is for you and then when you have to give to somebody else and I was like, okay.  So apparently my grandpa was there too.  and  Eric knew what was happening  So he told me which ones to grab and then he gave me one and then told me which one to give to somebody else.  And so I did what he said and he told me to grab little batroc and he told me to grab like a necklace with a p on it.  and  then I had to grab one more thing to give to somebody else so I had wrapped.  a staff  and I gave it to her. I didn't give it to my grandpa.  And then the lights came back on.  And then everyone was told to go to the dinner table and so it go over there and there is this waiter who look like Zac Efron.  and  he was sitting by me and he made fun of my shoes.  Let's jokingly. And so he came with me to the front to take them off because there were she was allowed up there. I don't know and then we came back and we had dinner and I run wanted to sit in his bar and I was like, no guys. We have to leave at the spot for Zac Efron.  and there's this weird real wardrobe that said something like  this person in this person.  We're born with some magical power thing and I was like, oh, what's that and he told us a little bit about it and we were all just talking. Oh and there's this guy who is sitting next to me who  I couldn't touch anything cuz he was a kind of invisible. So whenever he touched something with his finger would just go right through it. So he like but you could touch like fabric so  I helped him like move his bowl cuz he got some soup or something.  and  yeah, that was basically it. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I don't really have any any ideas.  but  I'm just going to try to remember that.  Are going to be other opportunities.  And it isn't the end of the world. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I just think that I can do a better job than her.  and  the girl who got the solo  doesn't do well in front of audiences and my choir teacher knows that so I feel like she  You know should.  Do what's best for her and if she's not good with audiences and she shouldn't give her a big solo. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I want to learn how to be confident enough to compliment people more because there are a lot of things that I notice about people that I admire and I want to point out but I'm always scared.  Of what they'll think of me is so think I'm weird for complimenting them.  But I know that when I get compliments, I feel really good. So I want to make other people feel really good. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I want to grow up.  I want to  Have a car I want to be able to drive. I want to get a job when I make my own money and make my own decisions. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	The wind outside is really really strong right now.  and whenever it blows against my house it makes  Annoyed that I don't like and it's keeping me awake.  And it's giving me a lot of anxiety because I'm scared that there's going to be a tornado and I am really scared of tornadoes. 
9aFAN2WJR2SEgduLANZtG0UrcUn1	I like just writing about how I'm feeling and how my life is going and it's nice to just vent.  Turn something and to just get along get it all out.

AwGV5PMpUoeqthBB50CWBV8v3WG3	I avoid work every single fucking day. 
AwGV5PMpUoeqthBB50CWBV8v3WG3	I experienced mostly.  thought of  when am I going to get finished?  When am I going to be happy? 
AwGV5PMpUoeqthBB50CWBV8v3WG3	The only part that I had today was.  My grandmother is she tends to observe and analyze and question her grandchildren when they come visit or what they know and then I felt like she also.  Cover up about certain things.  Which makes me wonder why do they get in my sister case about her spirituality and then tend to say that they do the same. 
AwGV5PMpUoeqthBB50CWBV8v3WG3	compassion because  even though I flat out told my co-worker yesterday. No, I quit don't want to deal with it. I came in with an open heart a new mind a fresh pair of eyes.  Even with that kid working my last fucking nerve.  I came in there with compassion. 
AwGV5PMpUoeqthBB50CWBV8v3WG3	So this morning I just knew that today will be one of those days where I felt like I didn't want to be at work.  I felt very insecure.  Because of the cold sore that is on my lip was just due to stress.  I knew that one of my co-workers needed help with her student, which I felt overwhelmed with because now I have  Plus  five or six more students on my caseload that I'm responsible for with stresses me out because I have to prep and plan in me and I don't get paid for any of that. So that's more out of stress.  and it wasn't until I pulled in the parking lot and I seen the student that I  how the work was in general go the opposite way of school and then he saw my car gave me the look. I gave him the look like go back to school.  and  it was like  a nightmare like to see him in the morning everyday.  After that, I slept most of the time in her classroom, and then I forgot that it was.  Nutrition. I assumed that it was much.  so then  I visit my other classes.  Go back to the same class and it fell asleep. It feels like  I'm hoping her manager classroom and put systems and procedures in place when that is not my job description.  Again, it's not sound setting up boundaries.  I'm not sitting at the boundaries and picking other people bottles instead of putting me first and choosing my battles. I'm adding more to my play history of dealing with the things that I have on my plate.  I'm dealing with a lot of pressure.  I'm dealing with a lot of sadness.  I'm dealing with a lot of confusion because  I know where I want to be materialistically but I just can't get there because I'm stuck in this funk of.  severe sinus pain hurt  I'm stuck in the what-if phase or how or when  And when school was done.  I got a lot of tasks done, but I still feel like I'm having accomplish much.  And I have that. I feel like I haven't accomplished much put into the goals in my dreams.  What I want to do to be stable for fun children and myself.  and I constantly think about  me doing it all by myself.  I don't know that my children will appreciate it because that's who I'm doing it for but it still hurts because I am by myself.  and the only Escape have  is  I'm going out but I don't go out as often as I would like because I feel like that will consistently. I'm trying to learn to say no. I'm trying to learn.  2  Put boundaries of to protect my energy.  I know I have to realign myself and make a blueprint.  Of where am I headed? And I know I don't have a lot of time left and I think that is what scares me the most. 
AwGV5PMpUoeqthBB50CWBV8v3WG3	Besides getting rid of some clothes that is about it. I didn't accomplish any goals and tasks like I wanted to  but I guess I need to start investing in that. 
AwGV5PMpUoeqthBB50CWBV8v3WG3	I feel like I got a lot done today, but I feel like  mostly the stuff that I did today was forced. It wasn't like me getting a lot done to accomplish my goals and what I need. 
AwGV5PMpUoeqthBB50CWBV8v3WG3	well, I was okay the kids got along and  I cleaned up some clothes for the storage.  Well, I hope my sister was her car went to see my mom. Other than that. It wasn't anything stressful until like the end when I noticed I only have $1.96 in my account and I have no gas but overall it was a good day.  I can't really complain. 
AwGV5PMpUoeqthBB50CWBV8v3WG3	again compassion  mostly because I do have a big heart.  I do want to do my best.  And give people my best. 
AwGV5PMpUoeqthBB50CWBV8v3WG3	Just life itself. I've been given another day to wake up. And breathe be me and my children. I am grateful for that. I am grateful for having understanding children. I am grateful for being here.

AwGV5PMpUoeqthBB50CWBV8v3WG3	I guess because generally they know me they know that what I do is out.  Is out of my heart. It's love it's respected.  And I genuinely care. 
AwGV5PMpUoeqthBB50CWBV8v3WG3	I haven't dealt with it.  I'm still trying to process.  My whole body is in trauma right now, and I don't know how to get out.  I ignore it.  Sometimes I Cry  Sometimes I just ignore it and keep pushing.

I don't think I understood I need to make more memories in my life because  we take for granted every second that goes by and we need to make those memories last and be thankful and in the presents.

I sat on the beach for hours reading it was really windy but I was trying to soak up the sun. I ate sunflower seeds my favorite beach snack. Headed back and chilled ate dinner and watched the sunset. 
CAv7Fe56dXfOouj6GA3pGLmS4sY2	Megan complained about Kevin today and it’s literally January like she said the same things she said months ago and it’s like GET OVEF HOM ALREADY 
CAv7Fe56dXfOouj6GA3pGLmS4sY2	With lacrosse I need to focus on my own improvement and not worry about anyone else, same with my fitness abs goals. I am in charge and I am responsible for myself, if I want change I only I can create it. 
CAv7Fe56dXfOouj6GA3pGLmS4sY2	Looking forward for the besch 
CAv7Fe56dXfOouj6GA3pGLmS4sY2	I will make Positive Choices for myself. 
CAv7Fe56dXfOouj6GA3pGLmS4sY2	In 2020, I will focus my thoughts actions and emotions to create the best year yet. 
CAv7Fe56dXfOouj6GA3pGLmS4sY2	Yes that is exactly how I feel. It was just the typical day of high school nothing super fun happened and nothing bad happened but I just managed to get through it all. Life is moving too fast in a way how do I train myself to live in the moment? I’m disappointed because I went on my phone way too much that’s why I’m up so late 
CAv7Fe56dXfOouj6GA3pGLmS4sY2	Yes. It doesn’t help this week has been overflowing with hard tests and quizes. Other than that I tried to stay positive despite the negative emotions form sources around me. So far I am doing good. Today I did ab workout and yoga. Got my assignments completed 
CAv7Fe56dXfOouj6GA3pGLmS4sY2	Work was slow and boring then I was supposed to go to a party but it was canceled but ppl still went to other ones while I was home. The thought of college is stressing me out lately and I’m not sure why 
CAv7Fe56dXfOouj6GA3pGLmS4sY2	Nothing great really happened. Normal day feeling stressed about school work 
CAv7Fe56dXfOouj6GA3pGLmS4sY2	Nothing great or eventful. School, lax, hw, shower, read. Got in my head ab my friend and overthinking everything. 
CAv7Fe56dXfOouj6GA3pGLmS4sY2	"Good: carride to school, dinner at Grammys 
Bad: counseler meeting, homework load and hanging w my friend "
CAv7Fe56dXfOouj6GA3pGLmS4sY2	I was late to school, it was Ashley’s bday but she wasn’t at school. I failed a mr a quiz took math test got home went to work and then now I’m laying in bed 
CAv7Fe56dXfOouj6GA3pGLmS4sY2	Nothing eventful, pretty slow skipped lax don’t feel great 
CAv7Fe56dXfOouj6GA3pGLmS4sY2	Nothing exciting happened right now I feel lifeless inside 
CAv7Fe56dXfOouj6GA3pGLmS4sY2	I just had some scary thoughts, sometimes I think about the future and college and get so worried about it. Then I was looking through my moms old yearbook and she got most friendliest and it just looked like she had the best high school experience, while I’m over halfway done and I don’t feel the same way. This years been a little rough but I’m not giving up. 
CAv7Fe56dXfOouj6GA3pGLmS4sY2	Today was an off day. I wasn’t happy just trying to get through the day and I struggled I was embarrassed and sad. I just am not satisfied with high school, and I was reminded of things I’ve done in the past that are embarrassing multiple times. However the guy that I secretly like said hi to me in the halls which doesn’t sound like a big deal but to me it was. But... about 20 min later he got in a car crash and I might of caused it. Uhhh long story. But basically it was just a weird day and I had to go to work which was just sooo slow. 
CAv7Fe56dXfOouj6GA3pGLmS4sY2	Today was good the only downfall was Megan. She told me she is quote on the verge of relapsing and she bought diet pills to make her loose weight which make her sick and her mom found them. Which I am just in awe how does she think that is ok. How does she go around lying like that. She is a seriously sick human like it’s total disrespect after all the treatment her mom paid thousands of dollars for I can’t imagine her moms feeling right now. I just know it’s gonna be a rough rode ahead but I need to stay strong in myself and now let her influence me
CAv7Fe56dXfOouj6GA3pGLmS4sY2	It is a Sunday so I know that it is going to be a long week coming up. Thinking about what is ahead seems to stress me out. School has not been easy this year, and work and sports, as well as friendships add on to everything. 
CAv7Fe56dXfOouj6GA3pGLmS4sY2	I did a good job of finishing  my homework, I could of practiced more math, I still have some more questions on problems to ask him. 
CAv7Fe56dXfOouj6GA3pGLmS4sY2	Yes decent amount work and homework emailed ecu and requested days off 
CAv7Fe56dXfOouj6GA3pGLmS4sY2	Yes the fear of being lied to by someone I consider really close. Then the idea of listening to someone I never known. My hesd and heart is upset and I couldn’t stop shaking. I’m fixing it by telling you 
CAv7Fe56dXfOouj6GA3pGLmS4sY2	Extremely i was able to develop the foundation of colleges I would be interested in by touring ecu
CAv7Fe56dXfOouj6GA3pGLmS4sY2	Not really but I did get a good workout 
CAv7Fe56dXfOouj6GA3pGLmS4sY2	Yes I should of gone to the gym but I made up for it

CAv7Fe56dXfOouj6GA3pGLmS4sY2	Okay it had some highs some lows 
CAv7Fe56dXfOouj6GA3pGLmS4sY2	I’m proud of myself for getting through school and my shift of work not many ppl do that so

CAv7Fe56dXfOouj6GA3pGLmS4sY2	Megsn begging me to slover, I said no sorry but I have other priorities. Me months ago would have felt obligated to go

CAv7Fe56dXfOouj6GA3pGLmS4sY2	Me which. Is unusual I’m always trying to put attention on other ppl that when it’s my bday it feels weird and uncomfortable sometimes

CAv7Fe56dXfOouj6GA3pGLmS4sY2	Me waking up each morning 
CAv7Fe56dXfOouj6GA3pGLmS4sY2	Right now, I'm really focused on having a better year because the new year starts in two days. So I really want to start working on my mom's house being happier all-in-all and exercising more. 
CAv7Fe56dXfOouj6GA3pGLmS4sY2	School, gym, Karen, yoga, shower, read
CAv7Fe56dXfOouj6GA3pGLmS4sY2	I went to school and it was hard to get up but once I was there it was fine. Then I found out good news that I will be getting a new anatomy teacher which made my day. Although lunch was a little annoying other than that no problems. I got home and went to work and had a decent shift. I just don’t understand my math hw so I’m stressed. 
CAv7Fe56dXfOouj6GA3pGLmS4sY2	I woke up I got ready for my lacrosse game Trove there.  We tied I came home.  I watched two movies and the Eagles game. 
CAv7Fe56dXfOouj6GA3pGLmS4sY2	Work then home and did chores I needed to get done was able to relax a little 
CAv7Fe56dXfOouj6GA3pGLmS4sY2	I went to work feeling upset about the whole megsn situation. Had a shift that felt long, came home played lax and did a workout. Called meg and talked things out although I’m scared for the future and I still feel a little iffy about the whole situation. Then Grammy and g came over and we had jambalaya and it was so good. It was nice to celebrate with the fam for my bday. 
CAv7Fe56dXfOouj6GA3pGLmS4sY2	During the day was hard and boring and I’m still falling alseep which is bothering me but today was Brady’s bday and I had a lot of laughs. Lacrosse also went well for me I think 
CAv7Fe56dXfOouj6GA3pGLmS4sY2	Get two midterms done study for math 
CAv7Fe56dXfOouj6GA3pGLmS4sY2	Get through the school day go to the dentist went to lacrosse and kinda upset with how I did workout wise, then studied tried salad 
CAv7Fe56dXfOouj6GA3pGLmS4sY2	Get work done ! Stock freezer shelf’s went to Carolyn’s dad made jumbyla mmm 
CAv7Fe56dXfOouj6GA3pGLmS4sY2	Went to school felt like a slow day. Lunch was funny then went to snap pizza with Brady and meg watched hsmtmts and drive meg home 
CAv7Fe56dXfOouj6GA3pGLmS4sY2	Went to school, had an assembly about depression, got home worked out met with Karen finished homework and showered 
CAv7Fe56dXfOouj6GA3pGLmS4sY2	Went to school the weather was nasty really rainy but I ended up doing very well on French when I was not expecting, I had a wart appointment and then went to lax. I drove alyssa who was really nervous and it made me appreciate how blessed I am to already be a senior with my freshman years behind me. 
CAv7Fe56dXfOouj6GA3pGLmS4sY2	Went to school, then my appointment, then studied at starbs, went to lacrosse, and now I’m home 
CAv7Fe56dXfOouj6GA3pGLmS4sY2	I went on the March for life. It wasn’t the most exciting event but it was a good and busy day 
CAv7Fe56dXfOouj6GA3pGLmS4sY2	School was hard I bombed an anatomy test. I also felt internally sick like I wasn’t in my own body. After school was the post Malone concert. I had such an experience it was so good. He played everything I wanted to hear. However it was hard to enjoy the concert without the constant fear of calls repeated from Caroline. I ignored every single one and every text from Megan. I did not want it to ruin my night and as I read from the book it takes bravery to do so. I will wake up and start over
CAv7Fe56dXfOouj6GA3pGLmS4sY2	School ms cap came back so that was exciting! Then volunteered and make phone calls for csc, then lacrosse and got a good workout. Now ready for bed
CAv7Fe56dXfOouj6GA3pGLmS4sY2	Today I went painballing with my cousins!
CAv7Fe56dXfOouj6GA3pGLmS4sY2	I got my ears pierced! And went to megs house for the super bowl. Today was the first time in a while I enjoyed her company and was not dreading hanging out due to issues. 
CAv7Fe56dXfOouj6GA3pGLmS4sY2	It wasn’t bad, just normal day no issues lax went decent proud of my left hand catching and then did homework at starbs except I’m going to bed so late 
CAv7Fe56dXfOouj6GA3pGLmS4sY2	I did pretty good in my lacrosse game! Took a long nap and basically the rest of the day chilled. Right now I’m relaxing with a face mask 
CAv7Fe56dXfOouj6GA3pGLmS4sY2	It was fine until I was made fun of in math class. Guys are assholes periodt. And I didn’t study for anatomy so Rest In Peace to me
CAv7Fe56dXfOouj6GA3pGLmS4sY2	Lacrosse was kinda sad, I didn’t get picked to go to virgina and I think I’m gonna be jv or a swing. It was just kinda discouraging, I need to work harder.
CAv7Fe56dXfOouj6GA3pGLmS4sY2	Today I go back to school. First drive there then go to homeroom and all my 7 classes then I have to go to work after school

But I did.  have more motivational ones in the sense that things like  starting to run and lift weights  how to get more healthy  I've actually started to put that in some ocean versus just talking about it.  And those thoughts seem more.  attainable not just not just something I'm thinking about but actual goals and things I'm going to do in like I feel like I'm actually going to do them versus just think about doing

Cb6j4rYpE7a5FOuXSlWloF3NWTp1	Everything's going good. I'm a little concerned with Christmas coming up and our finances right now.  I wanted my kids always to have a good Christmas. I'm concerned with my son's behavior in school. I'm going to say concern with my husband's relationship with his daughter. I'm concerned about a lot of things, but I know that this is temporary and I know it can get better. 
Cb6j4rYpE7a5FOuXSlWloF3NWTp1	Today, I'm just feeling blah more. So like  Not enthused about anything.  In a state of mine of just coping with everything that's going around me.  I'm grateful today because I know things could be definitely worse. 
ChpLcf33J4WQonEKuIOfqsiCFxr1	no idea  how you feel, Maybe? 
ChpLcf33J4WQonEKuIOfqsiCFxr1	Out my open not really out in the open, but they don't share it with people. But if it needs to be done, it's done.  I don't really stored anywhere. I just get it done and move on. 
ChpLcf33J4WQonEKuIOfqsiCFxr1	I think you mean what is open but not really only open and buy that I pretty much just mean it like I don't stored inside if something I feel needs to be done. I just get it taken care of, but I don't.  What kind of hold onto it until I can do it. I just get it done as soon as possible and then move on from it. 
ChpLcf33J4WQonEKuIOfqsiCFxr1	I didn't say higher. I said write it down.  Just to express that I guess.  Usher 
ChpLcf33J4WQonEKuIOfqsiCFxr1	Yeah, I have no idea what that means. 
ChpLcf33J4WQonEKuIOfqsiCFxr1	I have no idea what that even supposed to mean. 
ChpLcf33J4WQonEKuIOfqsiCFxr1	My name is Shayla.  19  and I'm in college going through a little bit of stuff right now.  Gang gang love that for me. 
ChpLcf33J4WQonEKuIOfqsiCFxr1	It works so healthy body.  It could be uglier. I guess when it's not the ugliest body I've ever seen so I suppose I'm thankful for that, too. 
ChpLcf33J4WQonEKuIOfqsiCFxr1	Is love an emotion.  because if so, then love 
ChpLcf33J4WQonEKuIOfqsiCFxr1	Then the world would be overpopulated. 
ChpLcf33J4WQonEKuIOfqsiCFxr1	The world will be a pretty boring place would be better place I suppose but it'd be boring because there be no conflict as humans. We kind of crave conflict, I think. 
ChpLcf33J4WQonEKuIOfqsiCFxr1	Already answered this one. 
ChpLcf33J4WQonEKuIOfqsiCFxr1	Maybe  seeing where things go with.  Trevor 
ChpLcf33J4WQonEKuIOfqsiCFxr1	I'm just trying to figure out how this app works.  Like this is it's it's weird to me. I don't understand.  If I can trust it, I guess I don't know.  I'm going to try that with me. It's a really cool concept, I think.  What's on my mind right now?  Come out of the app because I'm really missing Trevor right now.  I felt like I needed to write it down lower.  Talk about it or something. But you know, this app is pretty cool actually, but that's what's on my mind. Just trying to figure it out. 
ChpLcf33J4WQonEKuIOfqsiCFxr1	My heart and put a big heart. 
ChpLcf33J4WQonEKuIOfqsiCFxr1	Yeah actually makes me I'm scared that.  Things will turn out the way that I want them to and they won't have the people in my life that I want to and I won't make everyone proud.  Which is really scary to me makes me very nervous. 
ChpLcf33J4WQonEKuIOfqsiCFxr1	I don't really have anything in my life that I put on the back burner everything in my life is pretty front-and-center. If it needs my attention, then I give it my attention. If not, then I don't. 
ChpLcf33J4WQonEKuIOfqsiCFxr1	More of an evening person that I have no idea why it's the way that my clock is wired, I guess.  Much rather be a plate then up early. 
ChpLcf33J4WQonEKuIOfqsiCFxr1	Getting talk to someone everyday despite a lot of difficulties that we're having.  It's really cool that we can still talk to each other everyday and you know, even if it is just a simple, you know.  short conversation not very deep breathing and still really cool if we get to talk everyday and like  Regardless of what he says it still makes me happy that he's so he's talking to me.  I don't know if that's a good thing or bad thing. 
ChpLcf33J4WQonEKuIOfqsiCFxr1	My mom just got the biggest heart and she's so.  giving charitable  and she's honest and I think that's something that  everyone should be into just a really good mom really good person.  I mean, I like her. 
ChpLcf33J4WQonEKuIOfqsiCFxr1	Considering the fact that I am a girl.  I don't think that there is enough attention on women's sports.  I guess.  basketball because  there's that's that I think that's the one who scored that gets the most attention. 
ChpLcf33J4WQonEKuIOfqsiCFxr1	And then whoever the hell was controlling it is insane.  because when we what the hell is all this for 
ChpLcf33J4WQonEKuIOfqsiCFxr1	Become the best version of myself. 
ChpLcf33J4WQonEKuIOfqsiCFxr1	This is the type of shit. That's like  kind of weird like there's somebody.  Like on the other side of that.  Didn't say anything about sex. That's weird. 
CkKiBVnxOjMvkEzei8Hubd2BaZu2	Generally stressed with too much to do
CkV85ZDThwNFytJLyTqkX9HRTcu2	My name is April. I am visually impaired I love fairies and magic and I enjoy writing and reading and doing handicrafts. 
Cm3MJUQc09MCaLyiGboiaHzwcg73	Okay, it's been a little stressful, but overall it was fine. 
Cm3MJUQc09MCaLyiGboiaHzwcg73	There was nothing fun today. 
CvXPJ2K9kWb1OSnelp7oLGtSN0u2	honestly when it comes to technology  Television I know it's old school. There are tons of Technology life-saving ones some that I don't even know exist. That's maybe I'm thankful for that. I just don't know what they are. They're the one that I'm most thankful for at this moment. And this time that I used to Moses the TV so TV 
CvXPJ2K9kWb1OSnelp7oLGtSN0u2	today  an old lady told me that the kindest words. I've heard in a very long time.  It made me really happy.  I gave her a hug and I wish I could have dumped her.  And I'm very grateful that I got to live this feeling is amazing.  Day, and so I want to remember it for a long time.  What am I grateful for today?  Grateful for being alive grateful for my friends and price for my parents. They're held.  Thank you.  You are amazing. I'm grateful for you. 
CvXPJ2K9kWb1OSnelp7oLGtSN0u2	I'm not quite sure.  I think I like.  that  I'm open to anything.  I pretty much have  one of the most open mind  mine that have, Chris  as compared to  others  Maybe I don't come the same way to others.  But I think I'm open-minded.  very open-minded 
CvXPJ2K9kWb1OSnelp7oLGtSN0u2	His name is not price.  It's an old lady.  I don't know her name. 
D0nBZNBWYBWQwje0h0T63DPe6D22	I honestly don't think I have any gut instinct, but I guess like  talking to the people that hurt me. 
D0nBZNBWYBWQwje0h0T63DPe6D22	But I'm kind of emotional. 
D0nBZNBWYBWQwje0h0T63DPe6D22	Text my parents. They actually listen to me and actually help me. My prayers are very helpful, and I'm glad that I have. 
D0nBZNBWYBWQwje0h0T63DPe6D22	You know, I think life is treating me I guess there but sometimes it's unfair, you know. 
D0nBZNBWYBWQwje0h0T63DPe6D22	Being more productive and trying to help my family more. 
D0nBZNBWYBWQwje0h0T63DPe6D22	No, they do not make anything different. 
D0nBZNBWYBWQwje0h0T63DPe6D22	Like 5 because I have to go to my grandma's house pretty because my mom has to work early. So yeah, but I think if my mom had to work early I think like 8 hours. 
D0nBZNBWYBWQwje0h0T63DPe6D22	I mean, I'm just sitting in my home like sitting in my bed for now talking to you because I trust you with my feeling. 
D0nBZNBWYBWQwje0h0T63DPe6D22	It's because like you don't embarrass any kid like you don't like okay, if you want to go talk to me in private, that's perfectly fine. I have no like wrong and not like you could talk to me in private because it's not really embarrassing but saying it in public is so embarrassing to me. I was about to literally scream at her. 
D0nBZNBWYBWQwje0h0T63DPe6D22	being strong and defending myself 
D0nBZNBWYBWQwje0h0T63DPe6D22	I guess like my teachers being nice to me. 
D0nBZNBWYBWQwje0h0T63DPe6D22	But I'm a kind person. But I'm a kind person. 
D0nBZNBWYBWQwje0h0T63DPe6D22	I'm feeling pissed. I'm feeling so sad and I'm feeling really anxious. 
D0nBZNBWYBWQwje0h0T63DPe6D22	yes, but  like I don't know.  Even though my friends are there for me and I don't even know if I even have friends there just my acquaintance. I guess like I don't even know if like they care for me or something. I rent. 
D0nBZNBWYBWQwje0h0T63DPe6D22	Hey, I would learn not to put all your coins in a bath. 
D0nBZNBWYBWQwje0h0T63DPe6D22	the number I think I want to race in my in my own head is like taking a toxic friend back in my life because that's the worst decision I ever made because when I took that person back they made my life hell 
D0nBZNBWYBWQwje0h0T63DPe6D22	I think the situation is a decision is like me defending myself because I really need a solution and it's a big situation for me because I don't know how to handle it. 
D0nBZNBWYBWQwje0h0T63DPe6D22	Defending myself to the people that are so despicable my life that I need to get out and taking out toxic people in my life. 
D0nBZNBWYBWQwje0h0T63DPe6D22	Al Capone, thank you for being in my position. Thank you for standing by my side. I am so glad that you're my best friend. 
D0nBZNBWYBWQwje0h0T63DPe6D22	I don't know. I just have different personalities. 
D0nBZNBWYBWQwje0h0T63DPe6D22	Angie I don't know why I said sorry to her. I don't know why it was not even my fault. She's the one who like literally made my life feel horrible. 
D0nBZNBWYBWQwje0h0T63DPe6D22	Feeling calm and relaxed by listening to classical music and you know getting to know each other by other people in the communicating. 
D0nBZNBWYBWQwje0h0T63DPe6D22	I think I should be giving up my relationship with them. 
D0nBZNBWYBWQwje0h0T63DPe6D22	Okay, so there's this teacher named Miss you and let me tell you she made me really pissed today because there was a star student thing and then she had the audacity to tell all of the kids that I am really good enough phenomenal, but I need to change my grades and that I'm not going to ruin it because we had to test this today on for the math test that I'm not going to ruin it. And I nod my head like who says that like nobody says that that's so embarrassed. 
D0nBZNBWYBWQwje0h0T63DPe6D22	I guess I don't have any assumptions like I don't really care. I want to see little to care for me care for me. Lol but I don't know. I don't know. 
D0tnntGJUiV0xHBGzuUJdvJIBIg2	The mental health system. They see him doing well for a few days and they figure it’s all taken care of, but in reality it’s not. He’s still having behavioral problems.
D0tnntGJUiV0xHBGzuUJdvJIBIg2	The counselors and doctors
D0tnntGJUiV0xHBGzuUJdvJIBIg2	Talking to her. Realizing that I won’t be able to get my son from the hospital. Realizing that there is no hope for my kids and I.
D0tnntGJUiV0xHBGzuUJdvJIBIg2	I’m homeless. My daughter is in the hospital. I can’t protect or provide for my kids.
D0tnntGJUiV0xHBGzuUJdvJIBIg2	I found it in the Apple App Store. 
D0tnntGJUiV0xHBGzuUJdvJIBIg2	I took a couple of deep breaths. It didn’t help.
D0tnntGJUiV0xHBGzuUJdvJIBIg2	I’m lucky I have a parent that’s proud of me
D0tnntGJUiV0xHBGzuUJdvJIBIg2	The mental health system in any state kinda drops the ball when it comes to kids like ianto.
D0tnntGJUiV0xHBGzuUJdvJIBIg2	Life will through me curveballs, but I’m ready for them
D0tnntGJUiV0xHBGzuUJdvJIBIg2	I trust myself; I know myself best
D0tnntGJUiV0xHBGzuUJdvJIBIg2	I will accept praise when it is due
D0tnntGJUiV0xHBGzuUJdvJIBIg2	I love the person I am becoming
D0tnntGJUiV0xHBGzuUJdvJIBIg2	I am worthy and I am enough
D0tnntGJUiV0xHBGzuUJdvJIBIg2	Finishing shaving my brows
D0tnntGJUiV0xHBGzuUJdvJIBIg2	"I got to work in a warehouse
I got a hysterectomy 
I got myself some mental health help
I put several states between myself and my toxic family"
D0tnntGJUiV0xHBGzuUJdvJIBIg2	Having holiday dinners with my grandmother
D0tnntGJUiV0xHBGzuUJdvJIBIg2	Halloween. Because it’s my daughter’s birthday and because there are so many cool creepy things to buy.
D0tnntGJUiV0xHBGzuUJdvJIBIg2	Being told to that I was needed to come in to work on Wednesday
D0tnntGJUiV0xHBGzuUJdvJIBIg2	I got like 3 new followers on my blog and that really surprised me and made me happy. I’m certain that if I keep up my posting and work harder on my tags and titling I’ll be able to make a career out of blogging.
D0tnntGJUiV0xHBGzuUJdvJIBIg2	I choose to focus on the next step not the entire path. 
D0tnntGJUiV0xHBGzuUJdvJIBIg2	I enjoy staying present and in the moment
D0tnntGJUiV0xHBGzuUJdvJIBIg2	My feelings will always be valid
D0tnntGJUiV0xHBGzuUJdvJIBIg2	I know it is possible to tune out the negative
D0tnntGJUiV0xHBGzuUJdvJIBIg2	"I got ianto from the hospital and told Melissa how thankful I was to her and Orlando and how sorry I am for turning their world upside down. That was good.
The bad was ianto having another meltdown when he wasn’t even back for a full day."
D0tnntGJUiV0xHBGzuUJdvJIBIg2	I had an anxiety attack. I wasn’t as productive as I would like to have been. I did get a few new followers to my blog so that was a plus. I haven’t eaten much. Not taking care of my mental or physical health like I should be.
D0tnntGJUiV0xHBGzuUJdvJIBIg2	It wasn’t that it was run of the mill really. It’s that it went from being good to being bad, but overall I’d say it fell in the middle because the bad didn’t negate the good and the good didn’t make it so the bad didn’t bother me.
D0tnntGJUiV0xHBGzuUJdvJIBIg2	Like 10 minutes maybe? It’s still going.
D0tnntGJUiV0xHBGzuUJdvJIBIg2	"Take a shower
Take my medicine
Check my blood sugar
Write a chapter in my book
Talk with DCF
Clean up the living room
Do laundry"
D0tnntGJUiV0xHBGzuUJdvJIBIg2	I have to talk with DCF, and I have to call DES
D0tnntGJUiV0xHBGzuUJdvJIBIg2	Anxiety, stress, depression, worthlessness, numbness
D0tnntGJUiV0xHBGzuUJdvJIBIg2	Kinda. I got ianto back from the hospital, but I didn’t get to go to DTA or get his prescriptions filled like I wanted.
D0tnntGJUiV0xHBGzuUJdvJIBIg2	I’m not sure if I accomplished a lot. I was able to brush my teeth and floss. I also set up my reminders in my mobile and set up my medication reminder app. I also got my bag packed for when I go into a shelter.
D0tnntGJUiV0xHBGzuUJdvJIBIg2	I accomplished some of my goals. I wrote.
D0tnntGJUiV0xHBGzuUJdvJIBIg2	Talked to my bank, checked my habit tracker and completed a few things on there, wrote up a blog post for tomorrow, wrote a list of things to do. I’m proud of myself for getting somethings done, but I could’ve gotten more done.
D0tnntGJUiV0xHBGzuUJdvJIBIg2	My meds are working and keeping me from really low lows
D0tnntGJUiV0xHBGzuUJdvJIBIg2	I woke up early enough to get more things done
D0tnntGJUiV0xHBGzuUJdvJIBIg2	I can probably watch a horror film at some point today
D0tnntGJUiV0xHBGzuUJdvJIBIg2	being a self-employed artist 
D0tnntGJUiV0xHBGzuUJdvJIBIg2	Get ianto from the hospital
D0tnntGJUiV0xHBGzuUJdvJIBIg2	It lets me experience the world around me
D0tnntGJUiV0xHBGzuUJdvJIBIg2	Feeling like something was wrong
D0tnntGJUiV0xHBGzuUJdvJIBIg2	Feeling hot, suddenly aware of my heart beating, stuttering, headache, nausea
D0tnntGJUiV0xHBGzuUJdvJIBIg2	Someone stole my birth certificate
D0tnntGJUiV0xHBGzuUJdvJIBIg2	"Update my blog

D0tnntGJUiV0xHBGzuUJdvJIBIg2	"Finish sewing football designs on Bryan’s scarf
Patch up my backpack
Go to the library and work on my websites"
D0tnntGJUiV0xHBGzuUJdvJIBIg2	Because I love my kids and it scares me that I can’t see them. My youngest is only 7! He needs me and I can’t be there for him!
D0tnntGJUiV0xHBGzuUJdvJIBIg2	I have another day with my kids in my life

DLpGM1VzzoWk8ltm2Rly7Cs6EnP2	Well, I'm still thinking about it. So this happened a couple days ago. 
DLpGM1VzzoWk8ltm2Rly7Cs6EnP2	I woke up feeling good. My boyfriend is home Sundays and he woke me up
DLpGM1VzzoWk8ltm2Rly7Cs6EnP2	To try and not take things so personally
DLpGM1VzzoWk8ltm2Rly7Cs6EnP2	Why I acted very reactive Lee I acted on emotion and I should have just stepped back and not said anything. 
DNNacvCAdQVBA9l0CrTa0EG7Ti93	No, I don't really know if I have anything I can say that I love make things better right now. 
DNNacvCAdQVBA9l0CrTa0EG7Ti93	I miss my boyfriend. I really hate that he broke up with me. 
DNNacvCAdQVBA9l0CrTa0EG7Ti93	My depression honestly and anxiety. I'm really upset about this breakup. 
DNNacvCAdQVBA9l0CrTa0EG7Ti93	I stay up too late.  Wishing things were different and being sad about it. 
DNNacvCAdQVBA9l0CrTa0EG7Ti93	It would have been better if my boyfriend hadn't broken up with me two weeks ago and wasn't now ignoring me. I miss him like I miss my right arm. 
DNNacvCAdQVBA9l0CrTa0EG7Ti93	I have to clean the house for Jenny and Max. So once they're here in the house is clean. That'll be better. 
DNNacvCAdQVBA9l0CrTa0EG7Ti93	Been pretty miserable for like a month and a half.  And then she kept telling me something is wrong with me.  and then  he tells me something's wrong with him when he breaks up with me and let me think about getting back together and then we don't and it just I'm just miserable.  I don't know how this all went so wrong. He was perfect. 
DNNacvCAdQVBA9l0CrTa0EG7Ti93	I don't really know that I'm looking forward to anything anymore.  I was looking forward to moving in with my boyfriend, but he broke my heart so I don't really know what else is left to look forward to. 
DNNacvCAdQVBA9l0CrTa0EG7Ti93	She wanted to try again, but he had to figure himself out first.  And then I didn't give him the time he needed to figure himself out because I was too impatient and too scared and I ruined any chances I have it. 
DNNacvCAdQVBA9l0CrTa0EG7Ti93	I feel sad worthless hopeless.  unimaginably sad

Things are much much less forgiving.  Better and easier to discipline now.  And hopes that he'll develop good habits and be a better person later.

DV83lWyjQLZmr8SYKsWklxnymA32	I'm reading a book on Ronald Reagan's quotes.  There were a lot of interesting thoughts in there.  I also read a book on.  JRR tolkien's  Lord of the Rings  That was interesting.  and I also finished the introduction to  the great conversation series by  Encyclopedia Britannica 
DV83lWyjQLZmr8SYKsWklxnymA32	My primary new thoughts were about the m.  Military actions in the Middle East I did some research online.  with regard to Iran and the m  the history of Iran the history of the conflict between Iran and Israel.  Yam.  Foundation of Iran creation of Iran from  practice the beginning of the 1900 song  also the relation between Iran and the Nazi party.  and Adolf Hitler  Hannah World War II  interesting Lee  all parties involved in this discussion regarding Iran  they have  different claims about the significance of killing the  top General in the Iranian  involuntary  And the impact that will have on future operations feature Iranian operations in the region.  And throughout the world and definitely seems that.  Everyone agrees that there will be repercussions.  Although how are  leaders in this country seem to  Believe that they had a valid evidence invalid.  justification for their actions  They are.  There was one Russian news article. I write about the incident which has an interesting point of view.  I found it.  It was interesting that a lot of the arguments the Russians were making against the US president and administration.  Or some of the same arguments that the Democratic party were picking up on and using against the administration as well.  Even though the Democrats seem to  it's like the Russians quite a bit.  given that they accuse the Russians of  interfering with the previous election in  resulting in President Trump winning the election according to their accusations.  Although I believe that if that were actually factually the case.  They would have done something.  to bring charges up to remove  an invalid Lee elected president from office.  Given that they haven't done that based on those accusations.  I don't think that there's enough evidence to prove definitively or be out of reasonable doubt that that's actually the case.  Having said they are the Democratic party is attempting to impeach or has voted to impeach.  the president of the United States of America  based on other accusations which of course  The Republican Party claim are baseless and that the Democrats haven't presented or provided enough evidence to support these claims.  There was another nice article with Chum. between Israel and Iran and the US and Syria and Russia and  other parties and stakeholders and the Middle East  and their actions over the last time  12 to 24 months leading up to the events of yesterday and  interesting to see  That's supposed to check tree of everything.  I'm cautious about all of the expert analysts providing feedback and input into what they project.  This means Summit a project that will happen as some.  We find out daily that from weather men and women that.  Our predictions of our experts are rarely accurate.  and often  incorrect  while weather is  quite a difficult thing to attempt to protect based on.  Halo variables included in the model. I think it would be reasonable to  Make us a statement that geopolitical.  predictions are just as cumbersome to  McGavin  All the variables have play in.  The models if you will at the analysts are using to determine what they think the actions reactions and outcomes will be from these events.  I think it would be nice if our commercial media Enterprises would dumb.  provide us with  more level-headed and knowledgeable inside when they things happen so that we can get.  a better sense of the context of  Neo brawl  geopolitical in historic environments in which these things happen  So we're not having needed herc.  Reactions. I need your gum.  You know hellert that something drastic is about to happen or something. Drastic is inevitably going to happen.  some of these people have predicted  And which isn't necessarily the case.  I think there's another General misunderstanding in the general population.  Who haven't been in the military or haven't studied to military military history or history in general?  In the sense that they don't understand.  map  essentially  There's a military perspective on history that you're essentially.  Being at war or some kind of conflict is the norm.  image Wayne Wars  is simply  preparation  For the next conflict or next War battle engagement.  And you can be in conflict with other nations.  Without necessarily using your military might or military power. There's other means of power and influence.  That our political leaders have to influence.  a conflict or situation with the other nations  around the world  and we've seen that throughout this registration.  How about a variety of countries throughout the world?  Many of whom have been at conflict with us for many years.  awesome of him  or previously  Kevin Status says our people were pretending as though they were not in conflict with us directly or indirectly.  Even though there was valid intelligence and valid reasons why you would classify these people as threats or as in conflict with us.  for a number of reasons  and so that's one.  one thing I like about this Administration is that  They call it like it is.  They're not afraid to stand up for the truth. And for what's right?  I think I'm  we also saw a lot of reaction today from people.  experts and leaders in our government who are on  scared  they're scared of the truth.  They're scared to do. What's right.  And they're scared.  of the consequences  Of taking strong action.  against an adversary  Who is openly sworn?  death to America  and that's gone out of their way.  directly deliberately  Established organizations funding Material supplies weapons training you name it?  tube propaganda brainwashing people recruiting  globally  a network of terrorists  to attack the United States  our allies  and Israel  Or at least the last 40 years.  across the globe  and throughout the Middle East  to destabilize  the Regent  economies in the region  to do everything they can to violate every treaty.  Has been put into place.  I try to limit their destructive and disruptive power and influence in the reason.  this is because  There's one dictator.  Theocratic dictator  Omarosa country  it is our sworn enemy.  By their own voice and their own Val abolition.  They probably claim to be.  The sworn enemy of Israel the sworn enemy of America.  And they will do everything.  And I possibly can.  12 hold that bow  there's nothing we can do.  to stop them  to change their mind  where to make peace with men like that  sort of  giving them what they want.  which is war  these people will not stop.  They will not be friends with us.  They will not lay down their weapons were their calls.  I will not stop training people to hate us training people to kill us and training people to disrupt us and our allies in the global economy.  And our interests in the region or any interest that we have that move or flow through that region. They've gained allies among our enemies.  And they've been working with them.  to strengthen their interests in the region  intuition and disrupt hours  is very little room for negotiation.  I would love to see peace in the region.  I would love to see if we could all get along.  But there's one thing that will never change but these people had in that thing never changes. There's no way that we can have. Peace.  And the one thing that seems impossible for them.  2 Chainz  Is there total and utter hatred?  of Israel  I don't know why this is  they literate person or just think this is the way it's been for many many years.  But with a few minutes of research on the web.  Looking up the history of Iran.  Personally, this isn't the way it was for many years.  There's always the first.  later  and history in recent history that founded Iran.  did not  Mistreat, the Jews are actually was large Jewish population that used to live in Iran.  before the second World War  there are actually many Jews who lived safely.

Are there aliens 2?  befriend the Germans  for the purposes of convenience  NFL leading up to and or during the initial stages of World War II.  But I think that was out of either political necessity.  or simply logistical Geographic come  convenience and or  necessity on the part of the Iranians to help keep them.  problem now being overrun or crushed by the Germans  Might be easier to befriend them.  Then declare become declared. Enemy. I believe at one point. They try neutrality and I believe they claim to be neutralized as long as he could. Which is more than can be said for the pastor's the Italians at the time.  But either way, these are the interesting thoughts that were on my mind today.

DV83lWyjQLZmr8SYKsWklxnymA32	Sure, there's a lot of things to be worried about the future.  We have a  how the stock market Investments retirement  we have a small business and all the  three sources of energy that's going into that to keep that going in to grow it.  We have a complex as a nation right now with.  several different countries  So there's a lot of things to be worried about.  It's not necessarily something that keeps me up at night.

I love fam.  having good relationships  I love my family and my children my wife my parents and brother.  my friends  I love  the diversity of people  so many different how  circumstances and backgrounds and  languages and cultures and ideas  Unfortunately, sometimes that leads to conflict and I think we can all use a class or two on a conflict resolution.  and unfortunately, there's  just as there's good people in this world. There's also bad people.  And I guess the frustrating thing is dealing with people.  Who are significantly different from you?  Or at least appear to be on the surface.  I think if  we all stopped to sit down to have a cup of coffee or  break bread with someone  even someone that appear different we would find that out.  I probably have a lot more in common than we think just being part of the human family. 
DV83lWyjQLZmr8SYKsWklxnymA32	I think I truly love how to the president of the United States of America  because  he seems to be a man of his word.  he seems to  Take things, seriously.  and  Do what needs to be done?

DV83lWyjQLZmr8SYKsWklxnymA32	I think the things that lead to conflict down.  a lot of a lot of cases sorrow  simply failure to communicate well  and communicates new song  a multi-part process that involves listening and time as well as  Part of listening is receiving the message that the other person is trying to communicate.  And then responding to the person you're communicating with and who's communicating with you.  And sometimes people are able to do that and do it. Well, I think some people to have better than others.  And some people communicate.  Better with some people than they do with other people.  I think the end result of communication is  She pee.  Maybe  understanding  our common understanding  of what you're communicating.  And what the other person is communicating?  Doesn't necessarily result in.  sympathy or empathy  and doesn't necessarily mean converting the other person.  to your point of view or vice versa  but  developing a common understanding  could be a first step and no.  resolving some conflicts  as I think certain complex her.  Like I said, I feel your to communicate effectively and again.  communication involves listening not just  Speaking and listening is more than just hearing.  Cuz you can hear what someone saying.  Maybe not understand what they're saying.  Or maybe you're so busy thinking about what you want to say.  Or how you want to respond that you miss.  What it was the other person is trying to communicate.

Right around the corner from my mom's plot.  and  she broke down and  said how it's still hard for her.  but then she told me how  I was the first person.  Did she is brought there?  It's hard for her to go there even by herself.  That I was the first person she brought.  and I was  a little bit easier with me there and that made me really grateful.  not only to  be the first person.  I told her that I was honored.  That you would even bring me there.  Jenny hasn't even been there. I don't think  obviously not if she told me I was the first person but  we sat there and hugged each other and cried.  in the pouring rain  She mentioned her Jenny just left her.  And I told her we need to make a file that we'd see each other at least once a week.  We agreed we go out to eat.  At least once a month.  possibly every two weeks, but  at least once a week cuz she works right down the street.  Chicken stop on our way home for 5-10 minutes, or I could go there, but we would make it a thing because we need to see each other.  we will have a lot going on but we both need each other more than we know and  I'm so much happier and feel so much more whole after seeing her.

DwurQqqfTbYqy0n7P2AzDL67Xbf1	Someone told me about I was gay. 
Dzw0FfX997QQjUqW6VziIOEjPuq2	I'm not sure what this question mean. Where was the energy from the Sun located?  Lasher 
Dzw0FfX997QQjUqW6VziIOEjPuq2	I just answered a question on the fact that I had more energy. It made a world of difference mentally and physically I was I had positive energy and I was in the Attic. 
Dzw0FfX997QQjUqW6VziIOEjPuq2	I don't have a question.  I believe y'all got confused when I mention the word energy you related to the Sun and I was talking about a feeling vs. Actual rays of any type of energy. 
Dzw0FfX997QQjUqW6VziIOEjPuq2	I didn't really expect something bad.  I'm just fearful at times of the unknown.  But it's a gradual.  and slow process  I'm open to it and I am  Having positive thoughts at times today was just a little rougher on me with more rough on me. 
Dzw0FfX997QQjUqW6VziIOEjPuq2	Today has been a very cloudy day. I wasn't able to focus well throughout the day and I even  throw away my cell phone when I took trade to McDonald's. It's been  an emotional day the first day of my cycle.  So I have been somewhat sad about the changes that's happening. But also  expecting  I'm expecting something good to come out of it, but there was some fear Sophie or today. There was some loneliness today. 
Dzw0FfX997QQjUqW6VziIOEjPuq2	How would I introduce myself to a new friend? I would say that I am.  becoming more independent in my thinking  and not only allowing it to be a thought but to walk walk it out.  I am a  risk taker  I am  confident  I am  assertive  but reserved  I am  willing to  Go against the grain.  At this moment in my life. 
Dzw0FfX997QQjUqW6VziIOEjPuq2	I want to manage.  a balance  between  happy and sad thoughts.  And also being able to focus. 
Dzw0FfX997QQjUqW6VziIOEjPuq2	I believe what made me the happiest today. It's because I felt good I had energy.  So I think that makes a world of difference as far as mentally like mentally I was energetic and physically I was energetic. I wasn't worried or stressed out about things that will really out of my control today. So I think I had a mental healthy day and on the physical side of my body wasn't exhausted. So  I would say that it was what made my day the happiest I guess. 
Dzw0FfX997QQjUqW6VziIOEjPuq2	Well today I did not feel like I was stuck in a routine. I'm as I was saying singing in the previous recording.  Today, I learned something new regarding politics.  So I feel productive.  I mean over I just had a positive by blowing today. I was really to myself most of the day. I didn't speak to a lot of people kind of Zone, but I had a good day overall and I had more energy today. 
Dzw0FfX997QQjUqW6VziIOEjPuq2	This year I am truly looking forward to.  putting myself first  and  finding ways to make myself happy.  And becoming more creative.  Hoping that God give me ideas and also give me resources.  And give me discipline to fulfill my purpose.  And to serve give back to others. 
Dzw0FfX997QQjUqW6VziIOEjPuq2	This is the start of a new beginning.

And he loves to make his brothers laugh and I love to see them interacting with each other when they get a loan and laugh and support each other and have each other's back and just show up and encouragement to one another they do that.

E7M6Uf3yjIdkqjiB1A7QbHtyXu42	I think your variable terrible terrible. 
E7M6Uf3yjIdkqjiB1A7QbHtyXu42	I don't know. Can you hear me?  testing testing testing. 
E7M6Uf3yjIdkqjiB1A7QbHtyXu42	What's look good last night? 
E7M6Uf3yjIdkqjiB1A7QbHtyXu42	I did nothing much at all today. 
E8qAJTC7CqfatwjZlOwI0ATCViG3	I don't know if people necessarily hate me, but I know that I can sometimes fly off the handle. I don't have the best temper at times. I may try and manipulate others without meaning to is something that I'm working on daily. 
E8qAJTC7CqfatwjZlOwI0ATCViG3	And it's been about maybe.  It's an hour now. 
E8qAJTC7CqfatwjZlOwI0ATCViG3	I started yet on physical pain, I'll get migraines or headaches and that's when I know that maybe I've going a little too far too fast. 
E8qAJTC7CqfatwjZlOwI0ATCViG3	In all honesty. I don't think anything.  2 crazy will happen 
E8qAJTC7CqfatwjZlOwI0ATCViG3	That it's the right thing to do.  But that it might not be taken as seriously as I would like you to. 
E8qAJTC7CqfatwjZlOwI0ATCViG3	I guess say one positive thing about myself everyday. 
E8qAJTC7CqfatwjZlOwI0ATCViG3	In a year if things would have improved I'll feel happy that I made the decision. 
E8qAJTC7CqfatwjZlOwI0ATCViG3	So far so good kind of early right now and I just woke up. I'm a little bit anxious about how the day will go on later. 
E8qAJTC7CqfatwjZlOwI0ATCViG3	I love my immediate family. They always support me and help me grow as a person one of the things I really love is my boyfriend. We have such a great relationship. He's always so supportive understanding and always goes above and beyond for me. He's my best friend.  Another thing is music. I've always loved it so much and it's one of the things that brings me so much joy in life playing music and singing.  Those are my top things. 
E8qAJTC7CqfatwjZlOwI0ATCViG3	I think I've always still feel the same. 
E8qAJTC7CqfatwjZlOwI0ATCViG3	Hi, my name is Andrea. I'm just trying to find my way right now in life and see what I can do to grow professionally and emotionally. 
E8qAJTC7CqfatwjZlOwI0ATCViG3	Yes, that does make things different.  If I knew that the opposite was happening, then I would have no problems making a decision. It would be a no-brainer. 
E8qAJTC7CqfatwjZlOwI0ATCViG3	I feel like half the people generally enjoy me as a person and like me, but then I feel like another half really doesn't like me thinks. I'm a horrible person and that I manipulative. 
E8qAJTC7CqfatwjZlOwI0ATCViG3	I can't think of anybody who has had a similar decision. 
E8qAJTC7CqfatwjZlOwI0ATCViG3	I've already decided against completely living under a rock. That's something that I can't do anymore. 
E8qAJTC7CqfatwjZlOwI0ATCViG3	I am going to speak to somebody professionally.  Who can guide me through the process and once I have somebody on my side I'll go through with it. 
E8qAJTC7CqfatwjZlOwI0ATCViG3	Derek human for the other side would be that things are going to escalate get worse or that nothing is going to change. 
E8qAJTC7CqfatwjZlOwI0ATCViG3	Hopefully getting a job in healthcare and maybe even in possibly going to graduate school. Sorry that I've always wanted to do. 
E8qAJTC7CqfatwjZlOwI0ATCViG3	I'm very nice and kind-hearted.  I like to listen to people and do my best to empathize with them. 
E8qAJTC7CqfatwjZlOwI0ATCViG3	I sometimes doubt myself. I sometimes don't push myself to my Highest Potential and I think that's what I need the most help with right now. 
E8qAJTC7CqfatwjZlOwI0ATCViG3	Do something new for myself something that I really haven't done in the past something that makes me feel beautiful or something that makes me feel happy and appreciated. 
E8qAJTC7CqfatwjZlOwI0ATCViG3	There is no specific time limit but sooner rather than later. 
E8qAJTC7CqfatwjZlOwI0ATCViG3	My personal perspective is that if things continue say be out of hand the way they are now eventually, this is something that I'm going to have to do and take action on.  Because I can't allow her to get any worse than it already is I'm just a bit fearful. 
E8qAJTC7CqfatwjZlOwI0ATCViG3	I found those questions easy.  I guess it felt easy because I do like myself generally as a person. 
E8qAJTC7CqfatwjZlOwI0ATCViG3	I feel like I know most of the factors. 
E8qAJTC7CqfatwjZlOwI0ATCViG3	I don't feel like I am good enough.  I don't feel like I'm smart enough. Sometimes. I don't feel like I've had enough life experience. 
E8qAJTC7CqfatwjZlOwI0ATCViG3	I don't think it's completely accurate that everyone doesn't like me or if I was being manipulative. I feel like there were some situations where I could have handled it better.  But I was kind of young and naive at the time.  I feel like maybe if I had a second chance to apologize or not make the same mistakes with another person it would be easier. 
E8qAJTC7CqfatwjZlOwI0ATCViG3	I think if I didn't experience those insecurities I would be  growing professionally, I would  Be able to talk to people without getting in ciety, and I wouldn't be afraid of taking risks and chances. 
E8qAJTC7CqfatwjZlOwI0ATCViG3	best case scenario is that somebody actually listens to me takes me seriously and  the person stops bothering me. 
E8qAJTC7CqfatwjZlOwI0ATCViG3	Again, things would improve that I'll feel very happy that I made the decision. 
E8qAJTC7CqfatwjZlOwI0ATCViG3	True factors is that this is wrong and it shouldn't be compromising my health mental health and well-being. 
E8qAJTC7CqfatwjZlOwI0ATCViG3	finding a job in healthcare 
E8qAJTC7CqfatwjZlOwI0ATCViG3	The worst-case outcome is that nobody believes me or turned it turn the tables get turned on me. 
E8qAJTC7CqfatwjZlOwI0ATCViG3	That I'm doing my best to get my priorities straight and taking steps to do so. 
E8qAJTC7CqfatwjZlOwI0ATCViG3	I'm usually pretty nice to myself. I like to practice self-care. 
E8qAJTC7CqfatwjZlOwI0ATCViG3	I see myself as kind-hearted and pathetic.  An easygoing I see myself as someone who tries her best to learn from her mistakes and keep going. I see myself as a fighter who doesn't like to give up and someone who overall just enjoys feeling.  peace 
E8qAJTC7CqfatwjZlOwI0ATCViG3	I almost had a well-being on my safety and well-being. 
E8qAJTC7CqfatwjZlOwI0ATCViG3	I've just always been really academic and it gives me a thrill. I love healthcare because I feel like health is something that's super important. I lost my health a couple of years ago, and I'm slowly getting it back and I've learned not to take health for granted. 
E8qAJTC7CqfatwjZlOwI0ATCViG3	I mean I could be making things worse.  Or I could be giving up Time free time. 
E8qAJTC7CqfatwjZlOwI0ATCViG3	I've already spoken to a couple of Outsiders and they all tell me to go through with the decision. 
E8qAJTC7CqfatwjZlOwI0ATCViG3	The biggest deception is that it's not going to be taken seriously.  I'm not going to get any type of help.  It's going to backfire on me.  And I'm not going to have a favorable outcome. 
E8qAJTC7CqfatwjZlOwI0ATCViG3	I don't know.  Maybe I could speak to somebody that works in the field and get advice from them first. 
E8qAJTC7CqfatwjZlOwI0ATCViG3	This decision will definitely change my values and how they treat people in a way. It'll help me realize.  how to act how to interact with people better how to make better informed decisions in the future 
E9MaMWOeHTfYR9OxiEJqVpaFBy63	I think it's something that I just realized.  I really love doing things outside of my cell phone, but it's so easy to be on the phone because at this point  I can.  I can just pick it up and do stuff and then if someone tells me to stop I can put it down but there's not a commitment I guess but like when I don't have my phone I read or even the things that I like to do on my cell phone. I find more productive ways happier weighs more fulfilling ways to do them like fashion. I love fashion when I'm on my cell phone. I'm always looking fashion blogs, but when I don't have my cell phone I look at these are really nice fashion archives and  It's a it's a much more fulfilling like mine stimulating experience. 
E9MaMWOeHTfYR9OxiEJqVpaFBy63	Oh, no.  No, I I love traveling. 
E9MaMWOeHTfYR9OxiEJqVpaFBy63	I really enjoyed the the breeze.  I felt like I was breathing.  From the earth which sounds really funny I wasn't breathing.  Aesir this condensed concentrated heavy air that I normally breathe inside my house. It was it was a real Aaron and the trees were really nice Mason.  The sky was fresh and I smelled the flowers and I really liked that. I also would hear birds and normally bird scare me, but  it's actually really nice. 
E9MaMWOeHTfYR9OxiEJqVpaFBy63	peaceful  honest  I felt like  I felt relaxed. I felt like everything was okay. 
E9MaMWOeHTfYR9OxiEJqVpaFBy63	It's called Life Time Gym. 
E9MaMWOeHTfYR9OxiEJqVpaFBy63	a few  I used to be in a band. I stopped doing that.  Hey, I used to draw a lot.  I was trying to do a picture book and I stopped that I was doing exhibiting art and I stop that.  I  I used to play more piano.  Stop that.  I read a lot for a while for pleasure, and I've stopped that but I'm trying to still have other hobbies that I didn't have before like I've recently started hiking.  So but I think it's at a high-level. I've probably stopped.  5 Hobbies 
E9MaMWOeHTfYR9OxiEJqVpaFBy63	Yeah, it would be boring. 
E9MaMWOeHTfYR9OxiEJqVpaFBy63	I had a dream that my parents were in a very nice house and I have three younger brothers.  and  my parents were asking me to.  commit suicide  and I really really didn't want to but they were telling me that I had two and they were giving me nightmares.  and  I said I was trying to negotiate myself out of it.  and  They were they were just saying that I had to do it and my one of my younger brothers. They already talked him into do it. So my entire dream with me trying to escape.  From my house so that I wouldn't have to do it. But what was interesting to is that there were lots of opportunities where I could have in a wave with my parents dare I even say like I wouldn't I would not hurt my parents. I just had to get out of there.  It was very graphic and scary and I've never had a dream like that before. 
E9MaMWOeHTfYR9OxiEJqVpaFBy63	I would like my family to be better at communicating and planning because I feel like a lot of it goes on me and I really want to be a trooper. I just need to know.  What I'm working with so that I don't lose my nerve and don't go insane.  Because I'm stuck at home all the time. 
E9MaMWOeHTfYR9OxiEJqVpaFBy63	Because I can't control.  My day and those days become weeks and then months and then years. 
E9MaMWOeHTfYR9OxiEJqVpaFBy63	so when I was reading the chapter in the book today, I realized that  I'm I'm in the right career, and I think I'm a perfect fit for Consulting and  I realized that what I really want to do this year is just focus on  giving as much of myself and learning as much as possible in my career this year. Usually I have a lot of other side projects or side goals that are completely unrelated for each other and Wild.  Well, I'm still going to have hobbies and other interest in my life. I I really want to have this be holistic and still give myself this freedom of not having these different goals, but just focusing on my career and then my life being  balanced with that 
E9MaMWOeHTfYR9OxiEJqVpaFBy63	yeah, I  I love my job. I love what I do for a living and that's a big deal because I've been kind of trying to figure that out for a while. So that feels really great. I love solving problems that are difficult to even understand. I like to be creative. I like traveling I've moved around a lot. So it kind of makes us that I like to travel and I also my job makes me trouble and that brings me a lot of joy and I like being very entrepreneur on a can and 
E9MaMWOeHTfYR9OxiEJqVpaFBy63	Things are really heard. I don't like  my situation and I feel like I've been in it for too long. 
E9MaMWOeHTfYR9OxiEJqVpaFBy63	I'm just tired all the time.  And I don't feel like I had a good day. So it's hard for me to sleep. 
E9MaMWOeHTfYR9OxiEJqVpaFBy63	My very favorites yoga, but I don't do that everyday. 
E9MaMWOeHTfYR9OxiEJqVpaFBy63	That would be really weird and though I think.  I would get lost at the same time.  I probably still see them differently because they would force me to no longer look at them from the outside and  talk to people and get to know them. So.  maybe in a way  It would make life.  more interesting  But I still think because I know the world exist but differences it would be dull. I like seeing all the color and variety. 
E9MaMWOeHTfYR9OxiEJqVpaFBy63	I started a new job. I moved out of my apartment. I live with my parents and I take care of my brother who has a disability everyday. 
E9MaMWOeHTfYR9OxiEJqVpaFBy63	So my day was not a bad, but it wasn't that good when I think about the highlights of my day.  Making my bed is one of them which is kind of sad because that should just be a normal thing.  I kind of sat on the couch for a long time.  Waiting to see what I should do.  At one point, I read a chapter in a book and I enjoyed it.  But there was some TV and there was some me running errands and it just wasn't.  a very productive day and it's a shame because it's not that I have to be productive but  I am not going to get this day again, and I think that I missed out on having an exceptionally good day. 
E9MaMWOeHTfYR9OxiEJqVpaFBy63	I thought I was going to the gym but I ended up have to miss my gym because I was really tired and then I had to take Preston to then Dad last minute said he was going to take Preston and I was kind of frustrated cuz I thought I could take I can go to gym after I drop present off and then but that didn't work out. So I ended up having to stay home and watch Brandon and now its 4:30 and I didn't do anything. I want to do except make my bed. 
E9MaMWOeHTfYR9OxiEJqVpaFBy63	I know I'm going to accelerate in my career and I really also mm.  excited to meet  Jack  cuz I think that's happening this year.  And just becoming more of the independent Confident Woman that I want to be. 
E9MaMWOeHTfYR9OxiEJqVpaFBy63	It's difficult to breathe.  I'm  frustrated  worried sad 
E9MaMWOeHTfYR9OxiEJqVpaFBy63	I do not feel successful in reaching my goals today. I only made my bed and I ran some errands.  And I read one chapter in my book that I need to finish reading soon.  I didn't do things that brought me joy.  I did not spend quality time with family and friends.  I did reflux though on my goals.  And that did feel good. 
E9MaMWOeHTfYR9OxiEJqVpaFBy63	I'm trying to figure out what it is that I need to do what I'm actually going to do and I'm trying to figure out what  What it's going to take for me to?  Have a good day tomorrow.  So the first thing that's overpowering all of that is going to the gym. I've bought a gym membership and I haven't gone once yet and I really want to use the gym. That's the whole reason. I bought your membership.  Because of my Circumstance the only window I can feasibly go is tomorrow morning, but I'm not a morning person. So I'm kind of nervous about that.  Other things after that involves my to do list of work and stuff that I need to get done. 
E9MaMWOeHTfYR9OxiEJqVpaFBy63	I want my parents would never make me do that. So that was weird. 
E9MaMWOeHTfYR9OxiEJqVpaFBy63	I get.  Anxious and nervous and I feel guilty too because part of me actually wants to take care of Brandon and I want my mom to study want that to the work and I want person to museum, but I also really do want to do the things I want to do in a I get worried cuz I feel like I fell behind on things that I want to do.  And it makes me sad. 
E9MaMWOeHTfYR9OxiEJqVpaFBy63	I wish my parents were financially self-sustaining so that I don't have to be supporting them financially anymore. 
E9MaMWOeHTfYR9OxiEJqVpaFBy63	I'll be okay with that. Actually, you know, what if I don't have a cell phone, I probably do a lot more real things in the world instead of just spending hours browsing on my phone. I think the first thing I'd probably do.  Well, what does it mean? I don't have a computer. I probably read more because that's what I used to do before I had a cell phone and to be honest. I don't have a cell phone very lawn. Only recently had one where I've been this much Obsessed 2. 
E9MaMWOeHTfYR9OxiEJqVpaFBy63	Yeah, I went outside for a few minutes and I like being outside and helps me relax and it's a beautiful day. 
E9MaMWOeHTfYR9OxiEJqVpaFBy63	Going outside actually really helps me it some I just have to open the door and put my shoes on probably and the other order and so I think that's what I'll do. I think I want to walk the dogs are  Actually walking the dogs would be great cuz then I don't have to be home and get asked to do something that I don't want to do. 
E9MaMWOeHTfYR9OxiEJqVpaFBy63	When I'm financially independent, I want to have my own place near Phoenix. 
E9MaMWOeHTfYR9OxiEJqVpaFBy63	So I missed I didn't have a cell phone about a few years ago.  And during that time I ended up reading a lot of graphic novels. A lot of chapter books things that I normally wouldn't read and I was reading a book a week and I had a lot of fun and I felt like I really grew.  I don't even know how to explain it, but my brain was.  Thinking a lot about sayings and reflecting and I loved it. 
E9MaMWOeHTfYR9OxiEJqVpaFBy63	frustrated  and inconsiderate 
E9MaMWOeHTfYR9OxiEJqVpaFBy63	I want point. I was sitting outside.  And that's when I was reading actually and it just felt really nice. It's so beautiful outside and I'm definitely realizing how much I enjoy being outside. It makes my heart smile. 
E9MaMWOeHTfYR9OxiEJqVpaFBy63	My parents are trying to get me to kill myself with knives and I wouldn't try to escape with My Soul story. 
E9MaMWOeHTfYR9OxiEJqVpaFBy63	I can't have control over my schedule. I have to like wait to do what I'm told which sucks cuz I'm 29 and a lot of my time as me watching Brandon and just kind of hoping that he's okay and that I can do stuff but I have no clue what my day is going to look like. 
E9MaMWOeHTfYR9OxiEJqVpaFBy63	I feel like I haven't put myself in the center of my life and this is going to  make that happen and I'm I'm very I'm looking forward to it. 
E9MaMWOeHTfYR9OxiEJqVpaFBy63	I decided to.  Just stop feeling bad for myself and to just make the best of it and I went on a drive with Brandon and Mom. We went to World Market. We've got lots of candy. It's in the laundry room, and I decided to just postpone my gym goal to tomorrow and to just be a trooper and  Frankly, this is super sad, but I just I'm lowering my expectations. And so that I don't feel frustrated by not reaching the ones I actually want to reach because I feel like it's just not feasible. So it doesn't get rid of my feeling it just kind of postpones it and read your exit for now. 
E9MaMWOeHTfYR9OxiEJqVpaFBy63	I usually just right about what I've been thinking about for the day and those thoughts can be anything from reflecting on things that have happened or thinking about the future.  My wants my needs my desires, but I think I need to improve on my goals that sort of thing. 
EA1MdiRaUZOfCzWN3UcHMUKeJsU2	I feel like I have so much to do in not very much time. 
EA1MdiRaUZOfCzWN3UcHMUKeJsU2	I have so much school work to do and I feel like my grades are slipping. 
EA1MdiRaUZOfCzWN3UcHMUKeJsU2	My friends, my family, and my self respect 
EA1MdiRaUZOfCzWN3UcHMUKeJsU2	I probably wouldn’t because I am very shy until I get to know someone 
EA1MdiRaUZOfCzWN3UcHMUKeJsU2	I am really looking forward to track season because I think I’m going to accomplish my goals in pole vault. 
EA1MdiRaUZOfCzWN3UcHMUKeJsU2	I am graduating soon and I am very stressed but I have a great support system 
EA1MdiRaUZOfCzWN3UcHMUKeJsU2	I don’t know but I ah w tries physical activity 
EA1MdiRaUZOfCzWN3UcHMUKeJsU2	Today, I have had school and work. I was very stressed at work and didn’t feel very good. I felt very accomplished at school but I am still very stressed 
EA1MdiRaUZOfCzWN3UcHMUKeJsU2	Yes, if I have a bad day with friends or family I am more stressed 
EA1MdiRaUZOfCzWN3UcHMUKeJsU2	It will be awesome to go into college with an expanded knowledge and skill level. 
EA1MdiRaUZOfCzWN3UcHMUKeJsU2	I have to adapt my response 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	But I just said I don't know and I don't know what magician well, I would assume that a magician would use a metaphor or some sort of visual aid to make me understand. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I don't know. Maybe we're together in summer, and now he started up again. So not very long. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	It's all online Alive video cast so our instructor.  Taco Bus near time 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	No, they were sent over to the Senate. They were not sent to me. They were sent to the sun except for the next trial needs to happen. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	it was in one of the  it was in The View.  Room, but I cleaned today. So that was fun. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	My brother drink one cuz you drink it sliquid. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	She do by cheating mean for now. You're putting in brene brown. I assume she's doing killer cuz she's got lots of books and seems to always be Poppin about 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Oh, yeah, totally in the previous example. I kind of feel like that was happening to me. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Subdivision of myself. I ascribe to the theory that all of our characters are essentially like splintered versions of our subconscious. So in each of them, there's at least one thing that is us in a way so you can find yourself and all of your characters. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I'm trying to figure out what you're actually asking because you're taking two different parts of two different comments I made.  I'll just all thoughts have the resonating part just basically what do you say what you do doesn't need a resume with everybody as long as that resonates with a couple people you're good. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	There's a little no button. You just have to touch and it turns on. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	How much was okay bond in in Australia was super cool for sure. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Oh, they weren't sent over to me. That's for sure. They were sent over to the Senate and they made a big deal out of it. And I was just kind of running in place and thinking of home. Okay, whatever. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I don't know. It was not member about a memorable about it. But it was just funny that I happen to actually be tired enough to as she was taking us to the meditation doze off for about 10 seconds. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	A r e brake. I want to submit my re-break of my script to different festivals and screenwriting programs so that I can write for television. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Oh, you got to be so bad. No. I just a book. I was reading and then I finished and now I'm able to stir new one. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Failure is a part of success. So you need to let you know you're not going to be perfect straight out of the gate. And so you need to know. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Because of their shared pain and that they both experienced something that has been super traumatic and painful. It's why guys in the military form such strong bonds is because they've basically been through hell together. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	It's totally important that I'm grateful for it. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Apparently that's the greatest and strongest strongest and fastest way to get someone to connect to each other is if you've both experienced pain in the same way Twilight grief groups are good and everything and people can click and kind of form close bonds really quick. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I don't understand. Your question is a toasty Toto line.  Can we get chipped over the Tostitos chips?  I don't know. Maybe it has salt. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Tostitos chips are in the grocery store. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I finished one today. I finished the other ones. I finished a week or two ago. But this one I finished today. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Well Heart of Darkness is a writing tool we can use in our scripts. So if you mean to is in the second event could be the end of the episode or could be the end of the season. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I don't know if Christine has a book, but she does have her treat her like Manny for women coming up in March and everything. Just kind of help people grow. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Not quite what I said, but am I I'm basically leaning on and trusting my intuitive hits my intuitive gut to back Pete buttigieg for president. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Yeah, it's namora and Tabitha. I don't remember their their first names, but those are their last names. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Yes, I do from all my podcast and the books and stuff. It's basically that desire to have group Harmony that you can you can sense and basically feel like the emotions of the group and your main goal is to just keep everybody happy keep everything harmonious, but they could have a dark side that it could be to the detriment of your own sort of beliefs or well-being. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I didn't miss the best part of the day. I just wasn't sure which part was it. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Sometimes I don't understand your questions if you're not into it or what is it?  I don't know what you're referring to. I'm  I'm into the South development in.  That sort of a thing. Yeah. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	all the metaphors comparison, so  I don't know like just talks about the meditative writing stuff is you know, you have to go through things. You don't really have to use them but it's like the garbage collector. So you first you just gather all the garbage Bulba then it goes the facility and then it's sorted out. So it's that sort of an ideal. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	We can that's the great thing. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	It's pretty good for a multitude of things just said it helped her overcome her fear of water. So I hope it'll help me overcome my I guess need for control on the written page. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	My sister's like 30.  4 + 83  so this year she'll be 30. Will she be 37 this year wide? 8393 / 313  Find Cassie's 36in closest 35. I don't know how old Jenna is though. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Her to see her less just cuz we weren't working. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Gosh, probably about 10 years ago when I was in college, or maybe even high school. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I watch the movie Brittany runs a marathon. So I think I've got like the marathon training back in my brain. So I just want to keep improving my running in.  She get better. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	No, she didn't feel bad. She may feel good talking on the phone with her. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	If something breaks, something goes wrong or they decide to change. Halfway through. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Oh, she was injured herself quickly in like a day or two cuz she overtrained. Yeah. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Not a whole lot. The impeachment papers got sent over. So I watch them with their little diagram on TV do that. Otherwise, it's pretty quiet since you went there early. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Jobs at the resort and close to home. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I'm sure he enjoys it and likes it because he wants more people the back of campaign so he can win the presidency. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	because she  Likes to snuggle up with you, and she was getting in my video and gas was sitting next to me too. So, I think she got annoyed. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I got up I did my meditations my writings and all of that. I read I worked on my script sent that off.  put air in my tires filled up some  windshield washer fluid did some laundry went to the gym did homework cooked the whole shebang. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	That's an interesting question mainly because it's out of winter. I mean, it's it's out of our busy summer season. So we deal with Travis in the summer for shows and occasionally he'll call.  But it's just not something that's in our daily routine. That's why. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I don't know cuz I don't understand that question. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	It's not that I realized. I was not strong. It's that I realized that I was that like the subdivision of my personality that wants others to perceive me as strong as glaive and I have personified him within my script. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	American student loan that needs to be paid back is in the states. I don't have any but yes, you have a Federal Loan. They can garnish your wages in order to pay for it, which I didn't realize I so, there you go. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	You could maybe make it a delivery to change some things to make sure fit that format, though. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I've taken out at most eight people at a time diving on the reef. I prefer to have no more than four.  But most the time out there, I would either be a buddy or a cyst with a course more than actually lead. If anything it was just doing an assessment guy for being a buddy for someone. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	because it's a tense situation and they  still want  close to similar things and they all go about trying to get it in different ways. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Avatar Sausalito, I feel like these are riddles.  support of a Tostito  What's a tocito towline? I don't know about why does a boat have a Tostito?  Can I get a video of dosey doe something about dancing? I don't know. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	They generally adjust their tactics and tried different way Summit takes longer. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Because I was done and wanted to get it out of the way. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Because that's not Jam. That's what I want to do. So I want to write for television want to create serious and sell them and watch them go on and be a part of that and this recent one divemasters is very personal just in the fact that a lot of it has to do with certain experiences. I had while I was working as a divemaster in Australia on the Great Barrier Reef. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Of the third Heart of Darkness movie Inferno could be the end of it. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	she's asking me about things that we had cleaned in the cabin or things about Trump and the Drone strike and  things about some of the extra things we found the cabin as well. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Because they have good time management and set priorities. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	How you can improve someone else? I don't know. The first thing that popped in my head was the million dollar man change Evolution growth. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Because I think it's really funny when they die for food and stick their little butts and feet up in the air and kick around she's very silly. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I guess at this point moving out to LA.  Getting staffed on a TV show eventually creating my own multiple shows definitely taking off and Brotherhood along that route and expanding that into an Australian Multiverse, but a multi-platform storytelling.  Series I guess. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I think for Group 1  it's like three or four people submitted. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	She should be 36 cuz I told she's turning. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	This guy, I don't know. I think this guy lives in La I want to say cuz he works a lot of Hollywood people. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	This one had zero eggs, but I had a dozen. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	It was her birthday. She wanted to find something for a coworker.  and the friend of hers 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Obviously something I forgotten.  Hiram cleaning stuff at work 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Well, I don't have my own but they could do something. I'm sure. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Oh, no, I'm good. I want to go to bed. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	When things as the proverb says are dragging you let go or be dragged.  So yeah, there's things that we hold on to that. We don't realize are like those water parachutes that are slowing me down. But if he is cut the lines Let It Go keep going. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	No, it was slippery out and there was a deer I was going a little bit too fast. And I figured I'd go in the ditch instead of hitting a deer everybody else was going safer and got to work in a wonderful timely manner. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Yeah, that's my intent mean. I am a writer. It's just a matter if I'm a publisher produced or not. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Possibly. I don't know if I don't know enough. I'd like to just really know the actual details or  just have the faith that.  Things will work out. They're not in the way. I necessarily Envision them. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I haven't yet, but we're going to spring break. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I don't know what you're talking about.  Yeah, I'm just going to say I'm not sure. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	He did a pretty good job interpreting that.  She feels guilty for quitting things is what she says, but she keeps peeing in the cycle because her mom kind of showed her love by telling her it was okay to quit snot. They could you know  that she could if it was too hard to stop basically she's never had to deal with that discomfort and anxiety has pushed through its the end. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Oh by braiding hair by braiding it just it's just constantly vibrating no matter what even if it's super cold. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I think the original one is going for like $26. The pro is like 37.  ca25 30 bucks 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I don't know cuz you're  odd syntax of questions has  Kissimmee 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	You can't make muffins in a sovereign state Maybe? 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Multiple ways talking to people taking classes and meditative writing has helped. Jen. Grisanti is Health books. Just things like that. Just basic Gathering more information from other people who have had more success in that Realm. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	No, I want to know you don't want to hit deer. Our friend is totaled his truck by hitting some deer. So the question is deer or ditch. I picked it, but you can follow dear. That's fine. They're cool. They usually don't mind too much. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I don't know it all Trina is and  I don't know where you picked up that word, but  No, we fear the unknown enough. We should hope for the best. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	First person asked me about the past. I think you're talkin about the work stuff. Kathy was asking me about a couple different things. So I guess that would be who 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	What kind of depends on what you mean for you to rely on someone because of something they hate?  well if you're  Friends with them or whatever, you know strictly because of all we hate the same thing. So, you know, we both hate and pretzels in my head. That's not a good weird. You'd be too scared to actually admit things you do like or to have a deeper connection with them because you just introduce yourself in that so  I don't think you should be afraid to rely on someone just because of something they hate it but if your relationship is built on hating similar things, I think that would be dangerous. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	And it spread their business cuz my repair it was free because I'm covered under their plan. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	He pick up on some funny things. I say, I don't know what lima bean experiment is.  The term for a lima bean experiment lbe have no idea. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	All the time. I will need to study after my class tomorrow and when I am done and off of work first week. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I don't know probably wants bigotry and racism. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Since they might someday have sent to answer when I was. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I talked to her cuz I brought her up we were talking about.  Trump of all things and just kind of the sorry state are unions in right now and I expressed how I'm basically trying to be a bit more kind and generous and open and me not believing that in general people are doing the best with the resources and knowledge and perspective that they have so I have to hope that even though I really might not want to at times until I just sort of disseminate but a lot of my information I've learned from her. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	She just she just kept running basically, but she ended up injuring herself. So she had to wait an extra year to actually run the race that is just need to see, you know, the determination and then that was based off a real person. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Well, she's in the film and TV and consultancy Industry. So if she's closed off, it doesn't other people and then she's not going to be in business anymore. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Her speaking from experience will turn into a crazy person who loses all rational thought. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Can I get a crappy when anything is so good? 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	The $5 you're getting pretty smart your little app. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Yeah, I think I got to drink more right now my head kind of hurts. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	That I have no idea. I'm they called the other ones something but I can't hear what it was. I just keep calling it robot. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I don't quite know how you formulated this question.  X  is the creator of the meditative writing course so she has  Pictures of reading course she is writing courses. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	because they're doing exciting but in this case meaning the top of the ACT, it's because you had  the commercial breaks your kind of eager to know what happens you can kind of the audience has more patients at the start of an axon they do at the end. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Magic in the wand. I don't know are you referring to?  The magic that someone couldn't have you know what I just actually don't understand the question. So I'm going to  say I do not know. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Are you able to focus a bit more get stuff done and I don't have to really be worried concerned are cognizant of others. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	fleece onesies nice warm ones for winter 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	if I had when I guess I'd have to 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	You calling me Alchemy thing. I'm not sure I think there will be a bit of meditative sessions and lima bean experiment. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I don't feel bad about myself. I felt happy that I had fruit and like crackers and vitamins and crap to make me feel better and get on the rebound a lot faster. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Think it's going for like 27 to $30. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Oh you going deep today?  I'm not sure because I'm not in that position, but I could imagine that there's probably a great deal of shame that they have PTSD and can't really do anything about it.  Also, depending on how their military Cruise ended. They could either feel grateful and accomplish for what they have done or they could feel like they have unfinished business. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	No after I went in the ditch, everybody hits they heard about it at work. So I kept my co-workers past me and then they just started laughing at me, but it's all good. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Because you asked me a question about it. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	And I like the help. I'm not sure that everybody is necessarily into it. But after listening to a bunch realizing that yeah, you know my self-worth and all but actually wasn't quite at the point where I was because there was a self-deprecating which now I'm kind of putting the kibosh on that so I think other people do too 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Nothing happened to the score. But if you mean the script it's getting to the point where  I can start doing the finer details. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I guess I don't understand the question. I could do anything if I want to. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	How do I do use them? I just had them because I'm a lady. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I used like techniques and things I learned from the hellofresh people. So putting kale with apples and a little bit of oil vinegar salt pepper.  Lemon, zest and squeeze a lemon taste pretty good. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Letters to see if we click and connect. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	tomorrow and to go to sleep 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Typically in the mornings, that's what I tend to have my best juices flowing but a lot of it is kind of whenever something strikes or whenever I have a moment to sit down and just get something down. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Because you have to get that big structure stuff in place and secure before you start building off of it because if you don't have good structure to start with it'll just be kind of messy and clunky.  But at the same time it's art. So there are multiple ways you can build it is at the fire which one works for the story you want to tell. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I don't quite understand your question, but I guess me I've been writing my screaming this actually is probably the third or fourth.  The third time I've written this script from a different angle.  But I'm just using that as a jumping-off point and kind of figuring out everything pieces together. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I don't know for 5 years maybe on and off. But yeah, she's been there for a while now. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	At least something sometimes I can get a little sick with his his filming because his camera shaking all over the place, but he is a robot arms, okay. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I don't know. I don't understand the question and they're running around with their hands cuz they're attached to their bodies. I don't know. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	That's a tricky one. Honestly reading the proverb let go or be dragged helps me kind of do that and also having a clenched fist on slowly opening. It is a good thing visual aid for it. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Will show that yeah for infj seems to be the least common for males the most bit more common.  But intuitive intuition is our main.  cognitive function  And also yeah kind of reinforced the group Harmony is a big thing to tighten fj's that they'd would kind of sacrifice their own stuff. Just as long as the group is still happy. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I need a sense. What?  I don't understand the question could be any day.  Oh, maybe like cuz I'm just looking forward to any day in the future when I can work on this more. Let's go with that. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	2  Make the structure sound.  so Kate School is  usually seen and followed and also make the emotion between everybody more truthful. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I do more or less. They just mention you everything is made up of it. So, you know and everything or everything is 5 rating even if it's at a very almost imperceptible amount RI. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Minnesota why are you asking? 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	They just went back to their house they to pick up their kids and then they went home. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I mean The Magician's is the name of the show, so they were in all of it. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I don't know. That's what the meeting is for. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I want to get this draft done since this is an URI break and I want to get it to the point where I can submit it to festivals and eventually have it made into a TV series. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I have no idea. I'm just going to say 12. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	You don't know me pick it up, but he ordered a blood orange Pale Ale. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I'm just looking for most everything but  but something skill-based she might not do it. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I don't know I get the feeling with Jen that she'd be pretty open to anybody. I don't think she'd ever tell anyone that they couldn't believe that I think should be able to craft in the way the system. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	You just want to put the focus on the main storyline the a storyline and those characters. So it's essential to have them be the sort of cliffhanger a moment at the end of each Act. I was all too interesting to note that the more boring moments. He said are good to have at the start of the yak. Cuz there's a fresh clean palate. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	No, I want her to be a mentor to me. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I just thought it was funny how it was what event it was and it was our shop burned down in my present was in there. And so where the dog shirts and other shirts so we needed to print is kind of funny and cute. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I don't understand the question. They don't black birds are black and white birds or weight must have a magpie and that case run the other way. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Serta because the way you're mine cognitively functions with it, if you sort of a fake it to you make it if you act like you already have what it is you want to make decisions like a person that has that and then because you do that you will end up having what you want. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	No, I think they went straight to pick up their kids at their age as moms and then went home. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I just me being in my head and going over all of the possible conversations. I might have to have with the text that didn't even come to transpire at all. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	You're a your algorithms pretty good.  He know he's going to in a lot of his podcast and he did this in the one with Dax Shepard when he talked about how you know with the people, you know, they try and scare people into monogamy in a way like, you know, if you created ultrino that's really bad, but he said you shouldn't have to you know, strike the fear of God into a creature to do it actually does like you don't need to yell at a porpoise to swim.  So he is on the lines that you know, we're not naturally monogamous. But if we can sort of, the understanding of being the master reset, hey, yes, I'm committed to you. But if I need to get my kicks off somewhere else, you know, that's all well and good. It doesn't mean I lessen my commitment to you like it's a very interesting topic. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I do it with a clenched fist going to an open Palm that helps. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Who this when you actually got it's uncomfortable. It's unsettling to look at those.  The thing for me is that with how you know?  My siblings used to tease me about being found on the side of the road in the box and things like that. I kind of thought that my sort of repressed emotion was you know, what abandonment thing or like not feeling like I belong here in this family, but when I dug deeper, it really does come down to worthiness and that I don't feel worthy of things that I have you no have or will have her want  And I still remember driving home from Austin this year and that hit me and it was just wool.  I felt like I actually just felt so kind of sorry for myself and horrible that I felt that way like I didn't realize I felt that way and then I was upset because I knew it wasn't true and I knew that you know, everyone is worthy and then I realize that that's deep down what my characters are going through that what you know is their biggest may just hurt is that so that their abandoned necessarily it's that they just feel Unworthy of love and belonging and all of that. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I think that was the control part of me trying to pre-plan and be okay with it might do this then might do that. Because I wanted to keep that control. I wanted to prepare for every possible outcome when really was all for not. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Yeah, I would think so, but also knowing that failure is a part of success. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	You're picking up on some good stuff Acts 3 would be the middle Act of a TV show. So it's after I talked to before I left for and it's where you have your Midway a turning point of all of a sudden the shows like oh, oh, it's going to go somewhere else. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Can wear the you know, there were two shirts with my mom and Sherry just caught up about.  That's been the last couple months. I'm trying to think of what was a memorable one.  Will add had a lot of nothing. I can really remember clearly right now. Is that Ed and my dad were talking about different places to play solo gigs, and then I talked a bit about brene Brown as well. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Yeah, I did tonight knows pretty good. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	She said something along the lines of that that play is basically action or activity without purpose. So you're not striving to get something done like that the goal. Is he out to have fun in to be. Joyful. It's not to fix this thing get that or do whatever. It's just to do it to do it. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Now we're sitting inside the parking lot, but I'll probably take at least 3 hours. I would think. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I didn't take her to do anything just took us through the meditation. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I think I understand your question. You're asking me.  Banning Point all of a sudden being act 3 what a difference between what?  What other shows do this where they basically give them?  What they want she doesn't the idea of either you give them what they want or you make them be trapped somehow, so they're forced to deal with all that emotional underlings. That's actually going on. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	That's not a complete sentence.  Oh, I was aware of the fact that my class was draining me as the second week in a row where after it. I just kind of felt like crap and just you know, I needed a nap. So luckily. I took one. I felt refreshed afterwards. But he had I don't know what it is about it. What's that about? I'm not sure. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Mold rifle kind of is could be a byproduct. I guess you could say of play can have joyful moments in play. It's also just  I mean fun in a way is a big part of it mean you you play Just  because you want to 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	yep Bank Library grandmas 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	The show is real.  As far as the stuff in its gram and all that magic like the weapons. I'm sure the weapons could be like if you  Made them correctly inaccurately here. You could somehow figure out how to get them to work the physics of it might be a little weird and with the magic and dust but  you know.  Who's to say that could be the real world? 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Oh, this is silly. I don't know lima bean experiment snow. No one because they don't exist. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	A type of leaf is the maximum you can have with you if you are certified as either a divemaster or instructor. It sucks because it's just so many people to keep track of with so many different skills and abilities. So I really wish that the limit was more like 4 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Now that was just me Counting.  Nobody thinks she'll be thirteen when she turned 36 should be turning 37 though. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Just the fact that both of us are intuitive and nature. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	You can give them more questions and more nuggets of info. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I thought about my one class. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Durant's birthday. I don't know where you're getting. This is nothing. It's it's nobody's hands birthday. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	He had interesting of you to actually pick up that he had one too. It was a blood orange ale. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Oh, they were female Pitmasters and they were in Kansas City. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I don't quite understand the question, but just to be a mentor I can sign up with her through a program. So that's one thing that I really want to do. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I didn't say anything cuz there's Swanson they can't talk, but I said they were going on a date. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	They'll Miss Rider they make me feel.  Heard seeing understood and improve my writing on my process. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I'll probably be deep inside ourselves somewhere and sometimes we don't know what her boundaries are until someone crosses them. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	You or do you keep Aunt Durant 0? 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Not be concerned about the outcome. Just enjoy the experience. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	It's an online class. They were video recordings that went into this tool. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Me, but I'm also excited to know exactly where they'll I know where the hard and fast lines are. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	You know, but I also don't hate anything, but that also comes from the fact that I can understand multiple perspectives and see where people are coming from so.  I don't think they would and even if there was something that I had to Peg down as I go. I hate this I'm like, I don't think it would be something that people would be opposed to. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I'm sure a lot of people like to Anthony. I've never actually met him in person. So it's up to 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	we might want to consider just re  filming it or perhaps even restructuring their course. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	it's about using the question to learn your scripts how to  gets  and engaging question that escalates and has a payoff that meets or exceeds expectations. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Are you reading stuff into this my Mom's hanging out with my nephew's cuz they're doing a special overnight trip today. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Should hope you made it to wish what should be in the TV show my show should be made into a TV show or from Brotherhood social creators. Lots of good stuff. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Are swans, so don't people just two swans. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	She let me wear them to my homecoming because I was backpacking. So I didn't really have any sort of accessories that would go with the clothes I brought. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	The guy that's Dennis webinar Lynn something. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Didn't cost me anything other than time, but I had a fun enjoyable experience while I was reading it. So it's nice to remind myself that hey, you know, I know I loved her right but it's sometimes when it's for an assignment or for myself or something it can I can just be resistant. I think it's cuz I'm prejudging it. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	All the tip wasn't stolen was left behind for us. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Not a complete sentence that what should be written by people who know a lot of my instructors has, you know, they sold stuff they've written stuff poblano. They've been in the industry. So they understand the workings of the actual business as well as the actual Artistry and crafts of it. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Yeah, I guess so as long as it's not, you know morally questionable. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I was in so are the other people in my class. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Because I couldn't get their front wheel drive van up the AC Hill. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Nothing really. I was looking at other sort of I guess you could say smart organizer journals, and I do want the Evo Oracle, but  That might be a birthday presents and the panda planner was only like 12 bucks. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	They shouldn't.  Everybody should like him. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I know I saw that you dream of the credits, but I can't remember. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	No, I decide to take my nap on a bed do a power nap. So I go to a trance-like state and then I wake up and I'm refreshed and I'm good to go. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Oh, gosh, I don't know.  Good couple thousand at least I would think. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I know I would and that's what I'm going with besides the fact that I enjoy and like his policies and think he will do a good job. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I don't know. It's all about the story you tell yourself with your head. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Because I'm working now to make sure that the story works and that there's you no causality and linking and things makes sense. So once I get the overall structure and Bones of it, then I can go through with it.  tools and  Do the specifics? 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Spell fake it till you make it principles. So do you want a million dollars? You don't have it. Now, you know I act as if within reason as if you already have that many in dollars and do the things that a millionaire do don't be scared when it's cold as a $10,000, but yes, you know you need to invest 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I don't know tax increases but there an anime convention hit mat.  Him Max and right I'm doing signings and doing their lava shop. So I always liked those it was bring my spirit up. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I wanted to not be feeling anxiety. I wanted to feel calm and cool and collected and who knows maybe even happy and excited but instead it's got transferred to anxiety. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Gus not gas gas didn't like the loud noises or the cat being all up on top of them. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	oh, I think you're referring to you need to work towards those dark and repressed emotions and sides of yourself that most people don't want to look at and we explored them so that  Others can glean a bit of The Human Condition from it and feel like artik release. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	She's what about run around she got sick of me moving her off my lap. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I love hearing my podcast because I'm able to learn while I work and especially the ones with brene brown and people like that. They kind of shift my perspective and help me to just get him to that self development and self improvement mindset and  work to be a better human. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Do you mean okay blessed Final Fantasy? Well, it's published by Square Enix and  nomura did the last one and  gosh, the other guy's name starts with a t  no, I'm not touchy about it no more and  Alpaca key. Those are all characters nomura.  Tabitha and Tabitha namora and Tabitha 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Show the season of our work of our production business. So winter is an offseason and summer is full on. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I was changing my car so much. I don't know. That's just what they called it. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	It sort of helps ground you and give you a centering point and drive to be tracking just one question. Like what's he going to do with that gun? You know as opposed to why is that purple assisted? It just helps give a driving moment forward to the story. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I don't know, Maybe mr. Blue was getting jealous. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Evil to work with gas and pumped up the air in the tires. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	There are people I didn't know I was at some like new University and it must have been some of the first days because I was still in the getting-to-know-you phase of people headed up.  getting along with two guys from my I guess would be dorm area and one of them I had a bit of a crush on so I was flirting with and we were exploring and then we from the night or day earlier, whatever we notice some people kind of  Sitting near the parking lot and they had like sunglasses and bags and all that stuff and that was still there. So we took a look at it. Then these two girls came up one had a bit of an attitude on her and demanded the stuff back. The other one was a bit nicer and we decided to go and sit at this little table thing near the road and kind of you know, I'll try and get to know each other but the one girl just kept kind of stonewalling me and putting me down on the other one actually made an effort. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Definitely with chewing my nails.  I noticed there's a connection when I read and write and I'm either really into something or stressed about it all.  Start to go off on that. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I have multiple projects going at once. It's just sort of how my brain works and I know it's funny cuz there's some that you know, I haven't worked on for years that have suddenly kind of follow-up more towards the surface of I'll remember that thing. I remember that thing so I just have to be very cognizant of focusing my attention on ones that need to be addressed now at putting other ones for it in the back burner vokey. I can come back to this later. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	reading books on understanding how the brain works 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	A lot of times we don't just cuz she she works and I have my jobs and everything. So we just kind of  don't have it scheduled out just at random will be like, I want to chat and we go. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Because it's cold outside. It's like -14 right now and I want to be nice and toasty. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I guess it's important for them to watch the end of make sure the content is what they want and that they can  just spell the information correctly and then I weigh that the students will understand 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Pizza party for a Super Bee funny I want to attend a pizza party for anybody cuz I like pizza. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Because with this material I can be a bit too close with it. I see it in my head and I believe I'm translating it to the page, but sometimes just a little bit that gets lost in translation. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	She's an introvert like me so she needs that time alone to reset redressed and charger batteries. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I would say watching more episodes of The Magicians. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Most likely binging The Magicians and getting almost caught up. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	You on the drive home? There's a little black weasel that cross the cross the road and I've got to watch him as he kind of frolicked off into the woods. That was fun. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I'm fortunate that I have money saved up for my move to LA. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Activity, I guess I feel grateful for being able to run.  Keeping that part of me up in.  Couldn't physically fit. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I am fortunate that I am healthy and happy. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I'm thankful to take part in my online classes. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I'm thankful for my fingernails that haven't been chewing them. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	There are a lot of things I can think of one. I mean, I'm thankful that I have my car and that it's in good shape and  runs like a champ also the fact that I can stay at home and just basically take care of the house and not have to  contribute financially really so that I can say for my move out to LA. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	In my real life, not really. I think it might have been sort of a combination of the shows. I'm watching like The Magicians and possibly some of the stories I've been working on. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I don't really have anything concrete something's on my 2420-20 list that I know of now is.  I want to make the move to California. I want to have at least $40,000 in my savings when I move.  I want to donate to the painted dog conservation.  I want to join a writers group in in-person writers group go scuba diving.  Go to a conference for screenwriting.  All I can think about remember right now. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I'm trying to think now.  Well, I talked to Dad about the whole the whole idea behind the neurological brain science of like  Superbad predictors I will do and some sort of crisis situation when even though like we should know better. We still make the quote-unquote wrong choice in the moment. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	My one class talked about how in writing with your characters if you know how they'll respond to something or so, you need them to have a certain response to something which is going to be the last thing they would ever want to do you have to find the right event that would trigger that authentic emotion in reaction in them. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I was reading in Rachel Hollis book sort of a repetition of the idea of the fact that  no doesn't really mean no use nose is detours on your path to whatever your goal is. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	What's the singer Christine's podcast she delved into how this one woman was talking about. She thought her big thing was perfectionism. But really that was a shield against that girl's main issue.  with like rejection in a way and  to protect yourself from like via being rejected if she was when she would be your true authentic self. So that was interesting. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Want to just wrote down about was?  Kind of I found it interesting how since the Iowa caucuses were last night and this morning buttigieg mentioned that they were victorious, but I found it interesting how I was Defensive for him when people were kind of calling it out that oh, you know, he's saying he went Billabong like he didn't actually say he want he so there Victoria so he's the momentum to go forward. So I thought it was funny so I can look at all my intuitive hits and I was like, you know what he seems like my dude. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Turn off this is necessarily a new idea. But I was just I was hyper aware of the fact that  excuse be my television reclass really drains me. It's only 2 hours, but by the end of it or even before the end, I'm like  Hanging my head on the table and just wishing for her over so I don't know if it's the instructor the material or what or there's just something about the energy of it that brings me down. Where is you know, my 3-hour Alchemy class on Saturday, like just totally pumps me up. So I'm not quite sure if that's about but that was an interesting sort of observation. I guess you could say I had 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Might have been little bit too much for example is on my tablet to read my script. I was on my phone actually a lot through email with people and also  reading other people's scripts and I did was either Amazon or Facebook or something. I did a lot of like research for our trip to Orlando and then my class was like three and a half hours long on zoom on a video conference. So yeah, it was a lot of screen time. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	New thought I had today. I was working on my script in my head. So I thought of a new way to sort of structured out and string some things together. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Dad, and I talked a lot about brene Brown and belonging and that sort of thing. It won't go deep into it but rehashing that. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Something I thought about I listen to one of my podcast and they mentioned that they can Wade garnish. If you have a federal student loan that needs to be paid back. I thought that was very interesting. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Well, the new thought I had was when I was talking with leave. It seems like I don't know. It was just it was kind of weird. It seemed like  I couldn't really be as open with her as I can look like Jess, for example, so I feel like it was in a way further confirmation that doing a mentorship with Jesse's like the right thing to do. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I thought about things for my script part of it actually after watching queer. I had to do with military like when they  come back, you know are if they're discharging whatever it's like they're leaving their family in a way and also he made a point that yeah, you know, it's hard for them to be vulnerable if they're vulnerable than they could potentially get killed. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	My dad and I talked about Travis a lot. So we were discussing the ideas of you know, how you get into the Sound business for example, and whether that's ways of phasing a dinner phasing-out based on future projections and how we don't have debts, but other people do but we've also been very cognizant and aware of our financial situation. Also the idea that we talked a bit about just kind of different Life Choices how his daughter is in a creative writing very shy and introverted whereas  I'm introverted and a writer. Yes, but  from his perspective. I am more of a I guess approachable and go get her and it's like at a show I can pretty much do anything. So it's different. It's interesting to see how people's perspectives of you from the outside are. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Trying to think of something new.  Well, I did listen to brene Brown imagine that and she mentioned.  Crap, what is it? She talked about.  I don't know. I'll say something about relationships and showing up and vulnerability and yada yada yada. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I wrote my whole outline for divemasters for my television every class and that was really awesome. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	In one of Christine's coaching calls thing that she's popping in my head now is the cycle of the overparenting but the one woman's mom like basically kind of gave her the okay to take to quit stuff because she was the youngest and everything and there's a bit of guilt. It's like, oh I didn't get to  you know, I didn't get to get as close to you and you are at that. Also here. It's okay here I'll take care of you boo blah and then it was funny cuz the woman was doing it at the same time like looking for the the go-ahead to quit certain things when she was on the cost. That was kind of interesting to look at. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I thought about  well, I was going over homework and looking at the question tool and realizing just how difficult it is to Center on one specific question for the audience to follow and how to delete that one specific question as opposed to adding more to it and stuff like that. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	The book I'm reading is going in-depth about the difference between shame and guilt so that topic came up today and I got to explore that a bit. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	There's a lot of stuff with B.  infj thing  It was nice to hear to how other people.  You know the club and all that butterflies like not their Jam at all and they're not really, you know, they just don't it's like that's not me. So I'm going to do whatever so it's kind of nice to hear that people are like, yep. That's just the way it is. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	There were so many but one new thing writing wise is in a typical 5 Act of a TV show drama. They said for the pilot a good thing to do is want to reach the end of act 3 give the main character what they want and then you deal with the emotional Fallout of all of that in Act 4 that they kind of realize more what they need.  And yeah, that was really a good way for me to see the structure of it and how it aligns more or less with the character's emotional Journey overall. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	What's day after watching the last?  Star Wars movie, I guess I thought a bit about how you know emotional connections with characters cuz there's a point where Chewbacca like breaks down and is super upset and that's the first most like it kind of sad. So I'm not really interested. What's going on. I'm like that one. Hit me. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	well, we we talked about how it's not good to when you form groups and stuff to be United and to connect with people because of something you hate is actually very detrimental to the way you connect with others and  be vulnerable and all that stuff. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I think I made them feel good at the X-Men lunch. I think I  help facilitate a little bit of some of the dialogue.  but  I'd say that's  that's how I'm down. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Well, I hope dad I talk to him bit about how her.  A little trip thing. She went on yesterday went so I hope I made them feel.  Like they were hurt and valued. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I did my exact routine for my run which is good and I submitted my homework a day early. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	a lot of my thoughts focused on writing  because I kept going in my head a bit again and going in circles with some information. So it's not nice really new thought but I thought that came up was the fact that the creative mind and the editing mind cannot be active at the same time and when you try and do both that's where you get into that Loop. So it was nice to you no seat from that perspective in to try and Implement that in my life. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Well, these were coming up again thoughts because I was reminded of my pilot postmasters and thought about that. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Trying to think if there was anything that came up in.  Alchemy or anything nothing that really strikes.  Out of the ordinary, but they re duration of the story you tell yourself.  Came up again. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I watched episode of queer eye and then I was of course enamored with Anthony and  I wondered if would I ever?  date either 8in gender-fluid or  bisexual or queer man  Then perhaps I don't know. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I just had one right now realizing that like the sort of sense of Pride I get from having people think that I'm physically strong is a major weight and how I connect with my character glaive cuz that's his big thing is he doesn't want to be viewed as physically weak and it was just interesting cuz I didn't realize how much of that was actually in my sort of personality and psyche. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	This is from a couple days ago, but I can repeat it here the be do have horses have doobie.  Instead of you know when I have the thing.  I can do the things that that type of person would do and then I will be the kind of person said it's me to be act as if you are the person that has whatever it is you want and you will do the things that type of person does then you will have the whatever money car whatever it is that you want in first place. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Try to think with.  With Jen's little seminar thing. She talks about compelling questions. So maybe think about ways I could add those into my scripts. She also mentioned the idea of having a sort of big event occurred just before the start of a pilot. That was also an interesting concept to ponder. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I bought about  trying to think what AJ Marissa were at the gig. So I was interesting to talk to them and also discover, I guess in a way that their dog has a similar issues with ours when it comes to wandering around and I'm not staying close to home. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Guess from the church angle of it.  But one thing actually now that I think about it since you know, it's Christmas whatever they're talkin jesus-mary-joseph full blah.  So I thought about you know from martyr complex how much it would you know suck but at the same time I can understand because I call if I just go through crap then everybody else is cool. I don't have to do that but wasn't sure seem to think of the perspective of Mary on it at like knowing that your kid has to go through all this stuff and eventually  Dying is horrible way like this got a really sucks. I was interesting. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I listen to a bunch of brene brown stuff. And one thing she talked about is that we in our brains we I guess you could say no chemically get  Certify a rusher hits of dopamine when we make up narratives in our head is like if someone in a rolls her eyes do us more likeable. How did that go and they roll their eyes and we start thinking. Oh God, you know, imma sit down this until they're mad at me for blah we get rewarded when we come up with a narrative like that as opposed to thinking about it being like well, I don't know like what's up with that? Maybe he did this maybe he didn't like that. That was something interesting. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Just talked to us about being worthy. As you are right now not having to do anything. Your Artistry is worthy. And so just keep writing cuz you can and you deserve it. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Since I read a lot of brene Brown's book, there were a lot of kind of insights on there. I'm trying to think of once today specifically had dogeared.  She did mention the fact that play is something we need to keep doing in our adult life. Just doing something for the sake of doing it.  We don't always need to be striving and achieving and going toward some goal. Sometimes we could just you know, sort of be silly and have fun and do something just for the joy of it. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I thought about how to sew with a lot of the brene brown podcast. I was listening to in Reading Rachel Hollis book talked about kind of the face, you know, everything will work out. Okay, they also mentioned tell especially Rachel that you know, when you're going through tough crap and you're just like a wise is happening. You know, what's what's what's the reason for this? And with them being faith-based and saying, you know, God has a plan whatever it made me think of how when we create characters as writers were in a way that gods of our universe. And so personally, I know I would want nothing more than my characters to be happy and healthy and safe you need to put them through things that they can learn and grow and develop and become their best and most authentic version of themselves. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	My classes have been going. Well, my overall disposition and attitude has been quite positive and I've been very deliberate with my word choice as well as I continue on this self-discovery journey. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	My writing stuff be it for class and everything else. It's been nice to just kind of getting a decent work space for that. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Trying to think new experiences.  Your new opinions, sorry.  Well, I was reading my Myers-Briggs book again. So I was taking in some of the things that infj personality types do and how they  are more about possibilities than necessarily the here and now I knew that a little bit but I got a little bit more in depth. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Well, I did get into a bit of a spiral today about I was getting irritated and annoyed with my coworker because I was listening to some podcasts and she'd ask me questions that at the time I felt weird just I didn't need to answer and I want to just keep being in my head and do my own thing and then because it's stuff normally doesn't irritate me. It irritates me even more because I was getting irritated about it. So I went to a bit of a spiral but I was able to Talked myself back pretty effectively using the ideas of of you know, I'm I'm Not My Thoughts. I'm not my emotions also with that. You know, everything is temporary. This will go away get curious about this not asking why do I feel this way? But you know, what's that about? What's the feeling like? I thought the feeling of where it wasn't me, which was interesting as well. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I was listening to awesome with Alison her podcast. And what were some of the things there were bits about worthiness or whatever but made you talked about brene Brown and coarse mother people Eckhart Tolle Gabrielle Bernstein.  so I'm  thought more about that and also Rift off the idea that you know, when we as writers write characters, they're often sort of extrapolations of us and going through stuff that we are going through. So I thought back to my Trio for orphaned Brotherhood and how they reflect me and yada yada. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Watching a lot of queer eye stuff made me think about things along the lines of sort of self love and care and acceptance that sort of stuff also the big reiteration failing. So kind of just repeating for Nate brown stuff. Like it's not that you need to have the mindset of being willing to fail but like actually knowing that failure is going to happen. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Well, just Jess in our class has reiterated the fact that you know, when you do a lot of this writing stuff, it's looking at the repressed versions of yourself. And that your characters are these kind of Preston fractured bits of yourself, and that's what our job as storytellers is to do is when most people numb or look away from those dark pieces of themselves. We actually go towards it and look at them and examine them and then betray that through a cathartic experience via film or television. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	One thing I came across in one of my books is the idea that self-doubt is actually a learned behavior. So it's just a matter of us basically retraining our brain to get sort of out of that funk and there was a little bit of Rita Ray reiterating on the fact of worthiness and how  As you know Allison says Only You Can Be You that sort of a thing you have unique talents and gifts that the world needs. So for me, I consider that to be my storytelling abilities and my stories need to be shirts the world. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	well, there was an interesting line of The Magicians that  the difference of  what you've done and who you are.  trying to  sort of  reconcile that Paradox between the two can be a very very interesting headspace to be in. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I talked to my dad about Myers-Briggs in the breakdowns that each one has a sort of in a way that functional stack. That was fun. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I read a bit of one of brene Brown's books.  all the talks about belonging and how to be, you know, true to yourself and even vulnerable and why you got to be presently you and every situation so that was something interesting to think about 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I took out my saxophone for a bit. So I got to think and work on transposing from different instruments into my own so that I could play certain songs. I wanted to. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Piadia that you know perception is reality. It's based on what we believe and beliefs are just choices so we can change them. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	In brene Brown's book there was a lot of talk and it's about you know, connectedness and vulnerability and that sort of thing. So it's  it was really neat. I've heard it before but to have it reiterate how important the actual like face-to-face connection is with people and that isolation and loneliness can actually be more traumatizing and difficult on a person and cause them or physical harm and shorten their life and even like smoking and stuff like that. That was really interesting. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I thought about 4 class. We have a project where we have to write a scene on the question tool. And so I thought about how they mentioned that the biggest way to have a question is where  expectations are subverted. So  I pondered on what I could do in that regard. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I got to continue to sort of think about the idea of vulnerable nobility and the connection to people it's funny that the queer eye shows are picking up on that as well. So I thought that was very interesting. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I really ruminated on the idea of worthiness, especially with one of my characters how he almost more than the others.  Philip deep sense of being unworthy  and that in a way being a reason he feels he was abandoned and that he feels that he must prove himself useful in order to get that worth. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Trying to think of something that Zack said in televisionary.  The only thing that's popping into my head is  when writing a TV pilot make sure that you're a story carries most of the weight in terms of act breaks. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Well, especially reading my manifestation book just talking more about the fact that you know, everything is made up of energy. Everything is vibrating at some sort of frequency and like attracts like 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Watch the video with Talton about how to use the question tool and riding and just making sure it's engaging and how its objective that sort of thing. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	They're actually a lot. I listen to some Dan Savage that was reminded of monogamish and they also did things about the difference.  between the how basically male and female children are raised when it comes to sexuality and  it was really interesting. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Oh and one of the Marie forleo podcast.  I can't think of his name now, but  it was 40 minutes when I know if it's the way it was phrased.  was in a way that  but made it release Texas or if the idea.  That you know, you know not everyone's like you but there is not everyone will like you were like your work but some people will and you know, that's a reason to do it sign is someone out there resonates with it enjoys it get something out of it. That's all that matters. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I discovered the idea of disengagement divide where your practiced values do not line up with your aspirational values. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Go for tomorrow finish reading the book and go over my script to send Lori. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Tomorrow I would like to be fully present for my class so that I can better understand the Heart of Darkness 2 and how we can utilize it in our writing.

I've been listening to their video chat with people. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Surely so just tell me news for talking about the debate. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I would have to say my screen running Alchemy class in one thing in particular learning that the reason we shake hands is to show that we don't have a weapon because when you meet someone and their hands are behind their back, you're automatically a little ill at ease and cuz you think that they might be a threat. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	the most memorable part of my day  was  maybe taking the dogs to the vet just cuz that was more out of the ordinary. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	best part of my day  was either  Being alone at work and being able to listen to my podcast and everything. I wanted or just reading in general. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Baby reading the queer eye book or reading through my script and realizing it's actually in a decent place for what it is. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	You know, I guess Rider made me happy today cuz mom showed me his little pixel art that he didn't class about or shop. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	My sister caste made me feel good today because I got to talk to her on the phone. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	the best part of my day was either  being able to watch a bunch of episodes The Magicians or perhaps that realization. I had at the end of the day of me and glaive. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Pushing through my meditative writing stuff even when it was getting boring and I didn't know what was happening or it was going that was nice to push through that uncomfortableness. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Page Mac found 20 bucks in a room be cleaned. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I would think.  Looking at the Iowa caucus results come in.  Seeing my alignment with Pete.  and  but 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I saw two swans cut off by themselves away from the pack says like oh look, they're going on a date. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I'd say the most memorable moments were probably having dinner with that and Sherry and just catching up with them in general. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Watching the football game
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I would say watching queer eye. They had some female Pitmasters in Kansas City that they got nominated and they were a couple of thing couple times where they yeah, they made you happy cry, so that was good. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	memorable moment from my day would be  question. I'm trying to think what I did have like a mini Epiphany thing for my script when I was taking notes. So I guess that's one thing. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Who the football game especially towards the end was really good. We just barely won in overtime and they almost challenged it and it was very exciting. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I had a double Swan but on the way to work. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	That's an interesting question. I guess I would like to remember the Heart of Darkness issues when it comes to discovering and designing characters to know how to  quickly establish that connection between characters and audience Through the Heart of Darkness and shared pain. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Memorable moment from my day was and I was going with I finished reading a book so good. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Having all you can eat sushi. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I don't think I really have anything else a really that was a really really good day when it came to the creative process in writing and all of that. So I'm just really thankful for the day and really grateful for my classes in my ways of developing as a writer and I'm looking forward to all the more things that will come out of it.

EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I'm persistent and rejection only makes me stronger. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Well, then I got to get some better parts or something cuz none of my stuff is boring and mundane but I do have my brain and my creativity and Imagination. So I'm able to dream about this other world. So if it is a simulation people like me and those of us that have that creative spark, we can find a way to feed the simulation and get on the other side. But if it's all Matrix like in the real world is can I swear it if it's crap then maybe it's better. We just live here. However, I highly doubt that I bet if this is the simulation then like the real life out there is like Monsters and all this cool stuff that I can kill. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Then it'd be fun to take a boat to go to the edge. But you know, make sure you have an anchor Sea Tow it actually fall off because of cooled actually, you know be the person that jumped off if you are attached to something and just see what's on the other side. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I had my new class this morning, which was kind of blah wasn't as exciting as impactful as I was hoping it would be.  Then I was just a bit stressed trying to simultaneously do work for that class and my other two classes and some independent work. I've been working on so I think it was just a lot of things juggling in my brain and Crossing wires and not enough time to separate it out to sort of  Give them their own space to breathe. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Add a headache most of the day. My stomach was kind of a key. So that wasn't too fun. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I didn't get a whole lot of sleep. So managed to do my meditations. We saw a lot of kids and pets and family around so is a bit over stimulated than usual.  Also on my moon so that sucks. So I've been you know cramping and having back pain, but went to movie and I just got done watching some episodes of Queer as I can myself a pick-me-up. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	how to sleep in which was nice  and then I did get a new library book, which is really good. But I was getting frustrated because I kept trying to work on my script and it keeps feeling like I'd make you know one step forward two steps back and then the more I got into it the more I just started to become again uncertain and confused and started to spiral a bit of like, I don't know if I can not sure if I can do this, but I don't know if this will  I guess be what I want it to be and be the quality that I wanted to be. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I was just really dumpy and unmotivated and didn't want to do anything because I'm on my moon as the Dakota would say 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I woke up and it was funny cuz I didn't even know what day it was horrified to work that I slowly realized. I had to work. I was just getting annoyed at a lot of things.  cuz I just kind of wanted to stay in my head and listen to my podcast, but Kathy kept asking me stuff, which I kept getting annoyed at and then I would get annoyed at myself for getting annoyed instead of just  You know releasing judgment and all that stuff. I did have fun actually at the gym. I watched one of Robbie Damon's blogs and so here and Max they always make me laugh because they feel like you don't friends that I would really love to have. That was a good thing and then I came home took forever to make dinner. It seems like cuz of making risotto but it was good at least and then I watched a bit of my teleseminar. Well the debates were on and while I was running a little bit of my FanFiction 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I just hopped off and woke up in the morning. It's a bit annoyed with the dogs. I was getting annoyed with one of the ladies at work.  sexy looking forward to my run cuz I thought maybe some of that stuff could just  it run out of me.  And then when I came home to get rid of the lowdown on.  What happened with the we needed to know Mom and Dad kind of?  where  fighting isn't really the right word. They were just they were having trouble understanding each other and getting frustrated which and soon I was picking up in my  energetic space and I did not like it so I kind of  Put my protect Shield up to try and the Furret. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Basically go to work and then make sure the dogs don't get into trouble. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Oh, yeah, tasty crossed up everything from my to do list, which was awesome. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I got some big things like finishing and catching up with Jen's course and then do my taxes. That's good. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Yeah, I got quite a bit done. I got more done at work than I thought I would I got a lot of podcast Listen to I was able to get some reading and some writing would have been nice to a little bit more riding, but I was able to take a lot of notes or just helpful. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Oh, yeah, those thoughts big thing. I guess just getting annoyed when I want to do is listen to my  podcast and everything that you know people on the outside.  You're asking me questions. So not sure if it's that I've been around too much people or what. Anyway, I tried to manage it by. Well, actually, I've managed it kind of a bit poorly by just getting more angry at myself for being angry, but kind of released it now.  damn 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Yeah, I'm Dr. Monticello is getting hungry which maybe not focused and we get a headache so I read to distract myself and try to do some breathing meditation. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	He thinks it was a big mental day. I'm just excited to classes back-to-back and then we had our show so there wasn't a lot of breathing room, but I was able to accomplish a lot. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Yeah, I guess so a little bit of introspection. It was nice to get into the groove of meditative writing again cuz it was nice to just you know.  Go to the kind of meditative trance and then just right straight without stopping. I got to go back into one of my old fanfiction work. So that was really fun to kind of drop back in there. And then yeah all the reading I did was really beneficial and really good. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I got an okay Mountain.  evening  kind of shot, but  I still got to read a little bit sand.  You know cook dinner and kind of get the last thing a biggest thing was getting the Lowdown from Dad about everything that's going on here in the next couple weeks or so when it comes to work. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	It was all right that mean we got done everything at work. We left early then I did manage to get some homework done.  And go to the gym and do my full run, which was nice, but I probably could have done a bit more I guess. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I'm a bit. I mean I do get through a sort of I guess you could call it next draft of uxo. I also found some contests and fellowship application deadlines and stuff. So I want to try and push that one through the end of the month.  Yeah solar ego. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Yes, I do. Got a lot of household stuff done and then my own little side stuff. I think I was doing a bit of resistance / procrastinating today, but I am feeling excited to do all that jazz tomorrow. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Good stuff done at work. Learn some things that worked on projects. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Yeah, more or less at my glasses. Did the gig work on homework? 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I don't know. Not really. I guess I mean I read a bit but I knew today was going to be a wash pretty much but we do know I still watch some things and got a movie and so I guess that's good. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Yeah, I got a butt load of work managed to get in the gym workout 2 and then the biggest success came with sort of organizing my thoughts when it came to my script. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Yes, I got my homework done that needed to be done. I went with dad to pick up Aaron Brack and work on some of the homework.

EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I work we clean some really nasty rooms that was good at a little bit of reading, but I actually didn't feel too good about that cuz I couldn't really get into the book about it.

EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	How to practice writing for my assignment which was good and also to with that my empathic nature they came out because I was feeling the feelings of my character. So in a way that was good for me to understand where those feelings but I feel them in my body and how to recognize two that you know, it's not my emotions was her emotions. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	The main things were you know work gym cook and then oh, yes, I my feedback off to my class.  So yeah successful. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Yeah, the big thing is to go get the dive computer. Listen to some podcast did that and then some script work which I was able to do and I realized talking it out helps to those able to fix a couple things like that.

EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I don't feel like I got a whole lot done.  I mean I set my goals to work on my script and I got some of them and then I kind of just after a while. It was too much for my brain. So I took a break and was like will you know deal with that tomorrow after I kind of talk through with myself to see if I can come up with any solutions? 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I finished up a unit at work. I  got a jump on my homework for one of my classes and we did the bay rally. So all good. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I finished up classwork. I looked over some classmates homework managed to get almost all the way done with a another class did a bit of reading a little bit of writing and noodling on ideas as well and then watching so my shows and fixing my car. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	All right, not like we're over the moon. This is a greatest day ever and not like that suck but just like  This day different stuff. So that was a bit of a  interesting shake-up from normal 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I did a pass on my homework and got over halfway through my book. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I was able to read and get a bit of writing done as well as do some laundry.

Getting dinner ready in marinated. It was all good. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Guess obstacle was when I went to get Reno unstuck. There's a bunch of broken glass, but they were frozen the shards are frozen into the snow and ice so I had to kind of kicked some  Tell freedom but sometimes I would do it and they would shatter or they jump around. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Funny cuz I can't really think of anything is in obstacle so to speak.  Everything I guess it was everything was melting so I had to be careful walking outside. So I didn't slip any of the puddles or the ice. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Yes, it did. I got all of my videos and webinar type chat things done and watch that I needed to go a little bit information that right quite a bit nearly finished with the book and did my homework for my reading class. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Yeah, I think so work was the big thing then took care of some, you know, like household chores things and then manage to keep my anxiety down and do a little bit of reading and writing. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Yes, I did. There were a couple of things that will get pushed to tomorrow, but overall I am satisfied. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I got almost everything done on my to do list. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I got my homework done did my class?  Other than that took time to do like a mental cleanse and watch some queer eye, which was nice, but I think everything that needed to get done got done. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Belinda  what do you call it? The like soulsearcher book or whatever it was it is.  Reading she talked about like numerology.  Munch a bunch of other things and my  My number for my name was like a 7.  It was a one.  I can't remember any whatever it was. It was something like it was kind of a  It was me.  But it was like parts of me that maybe I hadn't really tapped into and then get sad stuff but like, you know pursuing dreams and Visionary stuff like that. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Most fit that work was on the actual task at hand cleaning. I did go a little bit in my head towards my homework assignment because that's due soon. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Well class with the big thing and then doing the stuff at work, but that's just whatever. But yeah class was good. We went a little bit late, but we are going to look at a lot in there. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I thought it was pretty successful. I did my little riding bits and meditation in the morning getting back on schedule with that red a bit and edited my script. So all good. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Am I still in putting up a bit of resistance when it comes to my writing?  I haven't looked into it as much to see whether it's  a judgment thing or whether it's  like a connection with my characters and not wanted to come out too early, but got to go before I'm ready is Marie folio says 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I had a bit of an energy dip in the afternoon, but we still kept on going at work.  Other than that, I don't really think so. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	More or less. I did a draft my homework we set up for a show tested everything and then I got to  binge on my show 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Yes, the big one is that I was able to about I'd say 90 to 95% get my new draft of my script worked out and sort of sequence in order. That was really good. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I believe so. I turned in my assignment. That was the main thing and then  I'm nearly caught up with The Magicians.  And I did some reading. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I feel crazy successful. I did all my morning meditation stuff. Like I always do I was able to scratch their all my emails.  Submit my homework for a class do homework for another class watch the video is required for three of my classes do errands in town.  take notes and  Watch some shows that I've been looking forward to overall was very very good. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Oh heck yes, another draft of my pilot my script done, which is awesome. So I plan on cruising through it tomorrow and then printing it out so I can kind of go through and figure out what other things I need to kind of mess about. I'm am also nearly done with my book before I can go to the next one. So that was awesome. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	It was all right. I did all my household crap. I needed to do got some homework done help Dad set up and then sort of just relaxed and veg out for a bit too since I was kind of having an off day yesterday and today. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Went well work was kind of the main thing did both Bowman was all good. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I think it went pretty well.  Main thing was the writing. It was nice too. To finish my one book. So did that oils to read a script which I need to do another to do. So the the like legitimate to do is I got taken care of. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Yeah, well finished book went through my script and input it's a note so I got something sticked off. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	It went to Grace. The only thing I didn't do was read a script but I am doing that for tomorrow. So I still get my weekly quota in I got my homework done lickety-split. I was able to take my classes without any distraction, which is awesome and get great feedback and do household stuff that needed to be taken care of. It was a great. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	The move to LA is falso end of September and beginning of October mainly due to work stuff and then the financial bit along with that. Is that the same time? 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Breathing good clean air. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I'm grateful for the opportunity to actually have time to read it's not be so bogged down either with work or the responsibilities that I can actually go after what I want. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Once again, you know what now? I'm going to change it up. I'm thankful for my  I guess cool sitting you could say like when I put something kind of fun non-negotiable sort of I must get this done. I'm typically really good at getting it done. But I also cut myself some slack when I need to. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I'm thankful for my empathy.  I'm just doing a bit of writing sessions with some of my characters in the fact that I'm able to feel with and feel for them. So strongly is something I know I can be hard at times. I really am glad that I have.

EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I frequently take my pets for granted. They can annoy the crap out of me sometimes.  But overall they're good bundles of fur.

EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Rewriting. My pilot has been challenging.  But I'm learning to enjoy the process more.  Said I can make it resonate with readers. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	My script is definitely challenging me.  learning how to  Distinguish between my writing brain in my editing brain and not getting stuck in that cycle of feeling like what I write is.  Not up to par of where I needed wanted to be but just acknowledging that, you know, this is as they've been saying, you know, the writing process when you first put it out is more of a birthing process. You can't keep stopping and trying to fix and everything. You just got to get it out. And then from there you can figure out what you got to do to get a good. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Discovering and learning more about highly sensitive people and I'm past and dealing with had enough get that my life.

EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I don't always really make resolution. So I think that's part of it is sometimes I just I'm like i r k there if I approach it as a lifestyle change it tends to work out better. But just one thing I've noticed from my marathon training. I like to come out a little too fast out of the gate. So a lot of times can be harder for me to maintain that forward progress the longer I go. So that's one thing. I need to be conscious of 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	My mom made coffee for me in the morning.
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Oh, what is it? There's something that they give me that.  You know what? I'll do this. I'm thankful that Sarah gave me her necklaces that I could wear to my homecoming. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I've been feeling thankful for just and her classes in opening up my way of thinking. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I was grateful to enjoy having a laugh with my bosses. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I'm grateful for least when it comes to running that I can kind of push through the physical discomfort even when I don't want to my mind wasn't really all there today, but I still powered through and that was really good. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	My soup I made I made myself. So don't ask me to attend the pizza for dinner. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I've been thankful for learning about the intuitive writing process and being able to recognize that.  The anxiety is part of it the getting sort of caught up in knots and circles and not quite knowing where it go that's part of it. It's just a process it's there. So instead of getting so wound up an angry about it. I can just sort of accept it and be like, yeah, this is uncomfortable. It sucks, but it's part of it. So we'll just, you know work on this other project this other thing and you know, it'll go away. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I'm grateful to be able to look forward to my classes will be taking. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I'd say one of my strengths is being able to see multiple sides of an issue. So seeing various perspectives which in a way helps my empathy.  And my connectedness I guess you could say because if I can understand where someone is coming from that I can empathize with them and then I can, you know consciously piece back how they were able to arrive at their decision. And I think that helps just build better relationships. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I am grateful for my  I know I've said it a lot my empathy.  The way I am able to feel with and for others. I think it allows me to create a deeper connection with them and I think I can use it in my writing. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I feel grateful that tomorrow I get to work which is good because I get out of the house and talk with people I listen to my podcast and get new ideas and they make money to go on my Adventures. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	This might sound a bit shallow, but I've been gifted money, which is good because I'm going to put that to use into some classes to help me with my writing. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I felt Joy today when I was talking about how excited I get watching the swans dive for food down at the river. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Thankful for my work ethic. If something is important to me and I recognize its value to get done. I do it and I will do what needs to be done to get it done.  As I say I'm like that right mix of stupid and stubborn to accomplish anything. So as long as I have the desire to do what I can do it. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	off food  for dinner when I made our spare ribs, I put some balsamic vinegar in there, which I'm grateful for that. I used to not like balsamic vinegar at all. But I think since every 7 years your taste buds sort of switch over and you might like or dislike things you did or didn't before I was glad to have that little flavor in there. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I'm grateful that I have my last class of Television area so I can get some rest tips and advice. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Grateful to be able to look forward to going to Florida.  with clothes and the boys 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	As so much but one thing recently is a lot of brene Brown's work in the distinction between shame and guilt and how those things affect us in our characters and how we behave and things like that and how we can use guilt instead of shame to make us be more wholehearted and vulnerable in the good way because of vulnerability is good despite the fact that we often times perceive it as weakness. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I felt thankful for my dad, especially if you're having a quick little chat with him yesterday. He seems like one of the people who  they might not understand me completely is able to get a little bit more insight into me to make sense. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I'm so grateful for my empathy. Not quite sure how it  Toyota factory in today other than thinking of my scripts 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I mean, I had a strawberry shake I guess that was good. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I'm grateful for leading into my uncomfortableness mainly during my run that was uncomfortable, but I still stuck it out and also in a way I wasn't successful but I did sort of lean into the frustration of my pilot and just kind of tried to stay as curious as I could about it without getting too frustrated. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I'm grateful that I will get to go to work and also that I will get to Quick go to Target to get some supplies and go to the gym. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	A big challenge was working through my script. I did a note card outline that piece together most things and then I went into my draft and you know, it deleted a bunch of stuff added in some new things and still, you know, maybe 10 pages short or so, but I stopped when I kind of started turning my wheels a bit too much and getting too much into it. So I'm thankful. I got done what I did and I'm thankful. I was able to kind of see when I was reaching the point of diminishing returns was able to step away before I just kept spinning my wheels. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	well sing with  cramps was annoying and painful and stubble is bus.  I was able to still get reading and stuff done. Despite that.

EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	When I was feeling my characters emotions and struggling to hold it together that was a struggle and a challenge but I remove myself from the situation for myself in a safe space where I could feel those emotions as if they were my own except that point they were and then deal with them and it helps those writing. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	The worthiness aspect has a big thing. I'm feeling grateful for

EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I'm grateful for the knowledge from my class tonight, but a deal with we are building a scripture on a question tool and how  The best way to do it is to subvert expectations, but you need to divulge the context most likely in a visceral way before you raise the question for us to be invested in it as readers and know what the expectations are that are being broken. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I feel grateful for my screenwriting knowledge. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Well, I'm grateful that I know to have a shovel in my car and it's how you know, the physics of car stuff works. I'm also acknowledged but I'm really grateful for the dude that help me get out. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Oh, I am going to say annoyance and irritation even though yeah, obviously they're uncomfortable and unpleasant. But since I'm learning to be uncomfortable and if not necessarily embracing that at least being comfortable sitting with the uncomfortableness granted at the time, it was pretty perturbed to deal with it. But you know, it did pass it was just temporary. So I'm glad I'm able to see that end distinguish and recognize it in myself. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I'm grateful for my vision board because it gives me something to Aspire to and helps keep me focused. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	What do they even eat wet and wild rice sausages? So I guess because I live in a place where wild rice is still somewhat prohibit prevalent. That was nice.

EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Actually experience some anxiety today.  Kind of a playful type that was good just so that I know that I can have those wide range of emotions and also that I know it'll pass. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Something I didn't have a year ago.  would actually be just the  sort of acceptance it awareness of  how do I put a like the deeper things that dumb cuz I did a lot of personal development and self transformational review the past like five six months. So just the knowledge I have from brene Brown and Jen sincero and all these authors from all these books that I've been reading that basically went fundamentally comes down to that. You know, you're not alone and you're not broken or anything. You're basically just like Allison says, you're awesome Just As You Are

EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Oh my goodness. I'm actually not quite sure.

EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Well with this one my fingers have been busting splitting and getting sore. So the lack of follow-through has impacted it negatively. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Can I have plans of Sugar Beach Bunny buddy? I mean, I have shared the LA move and the money thing with my parents when they cuz they are the humans. I am around most often.  Everything else like I might there is a group that I have on Facebook that I could put that in with a couple of them. But other than that, I got it. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	A busy one more Tools in my toolbox when it comes to writing. So when I feel stuck like I do on a couple projects now I can use those to kind of dig deeper and basically dig myself out of that hole. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I feel like this is a riddle one that I do not have the tools as you say to figure out how to do you know how to turn?  I don't know light bulb flashlight. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I don't really mean I don't help Tilted Kilt is going to help us by going over our  What do you call it packets information pool ball? 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Procrastination resistance of something that is blocking you from starting. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	A lot of it has to do with my mind just being pulled in a bunch of different directions and the main scripts and working on aren't the main driving ones that are tugging at me right now. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Bubba like Bubba Gump  I would assume Bubba enjoys it. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	When is send me some of those save me something of some sort of food? They either I don't know play me a bit of dessert or something. So that was cool. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	No, I haven't been feeling bad about it. I've been feeling good about it. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Just cuz you're always there. Anyway, they're almost like a lamp, you know there something that's just part of our house. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	It has to do with visually assessing yourself as you are and if there are any parts of you that that you are dissatisfied with how you can change them peanut butter.  Sort of place. Also. It just works in terms of opening up your mindset. So you are more growth-oriented and you can find ways to  improve yourself and just be a better person as it were. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I'm not a professor. So it's taken me many years to get to this place of non Professor Hood. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	They both can be pretty loud and bullheaded when they want to.  yeah, they can they can get both of them can get in their heads a little bit to 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Your guess is as good as mine. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I think so.  She's got people at work. She can talk to now she seems happy there.  So yes, overall, I think she's okay. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	This I don't know if this brain.  Guy is doing the weapon Arts the belt like I don't know harnessing brain power potential and remembering stuff or something like that as it seems someone interesting as her diving into it. I was talking about diving into my scripts and working on them. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	To clearly show my goals and aspirations for myself. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	No, I can't cuz I'm a highly sensitive person an empath and all that and it's just within my personality type to figure people out. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Dresses in New York and I really resonate with her meditative writing lectures and it's really helped and developed my own writing process. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	No, she was teaching me a lot. That's why I'm saying I probably got in the most out of her classes. Then I need the others. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	If it live right now is real or the other real or if the other real-world is real. There's all these weird monsters and stuff. They obviously put us here to keep us safe and to preserve Humanity. So I'm thinking more along the lines of like God Eater in the origami that just destroy everything or even Ruby with grim that come and just, you know, bring chaos and everything. Who knows maybe someone got a glimpse of the real world. So what that was and that's why they made those shows. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I wouldn't have thought of it that way. I mean she's helping me but I guess in a way I can help her out as by being open and vulnerable and ready to receive any sort of feedback and notes with a curiosity not judgment. And also she says thanking her in our Emmy speech. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	none, I guess I dipped back to sleep for a little bit when I  first woke up. So that was nice. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I bought it when I was in Japan when I went to Universal Studios in Osaka and I saw it and I was like that's something I can very much use. So it's some  it reminds me of that day remind me of Final Fantasy and just reminds me of the good times I've had with both. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Cuz that's just how I program my program to this needs to get done. All right, let's just get it done. It's the we like to complain about it sometimes and I myself am guilty of this. I'll complain about doing a job half the time that takes more effort than it does just to do the thing. So what's got to get thrown in? All right. Just throw in the woods not really as hard as it you're making it up in your head. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	The combination of the TV shows. I've been watching the stories. I've been writing. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I don't give less thanks and sisterly I just I know a lot of it actually is mental More Than Physical cuz if I can convince myself that I can do it and complete it and keep on my course than I can but the minute my mind starts to slip that's and I know I'm going down. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I would argue is because at least for me I can tap into my characters and right from a place of feeling their motion, which is good to connect the audience to viscerally with what's being experienced. But at the same time it's rough because I take on their emotions and have to process them myself. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	It's pretty bare their program because I bought tires from them. So I knew that I have issues I go to them and in most cases it will be fixed free of charge. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Usually makes me really happy giddy excited laughable mode. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Because they want to show their love and appreciation. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	0 because I do not have a restaurant. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I can't stand La have enough money. I think to move out now, but just with our business, I'd rather stay here and support the family through the summer get more money that way when I move out if I managed to be unemployed for a while. I'll still have funds to live off of without feeling super stressed. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I thought I sort of understand your question.  cuz writing a script and stories they  It's a way for people to connect and whether they connect with a character or a feeling for the remembering part. If it's something some sort of feeling that they can invoke in themselves from the past or something that year for the future, I guess in a way that can sort of filter into it. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	You I hope sausages don't have to eat insects.  I think you misunderstood me, but that's okay.  No, I mean we we live in the land of wild rice. So that's what we can have them. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I don't know if he's anything. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Well, there's a lot summarize thing. That shame is not conducive to a healthy life yet guilt is and also with the vulnerability that there is no courage without vulnerability and vulnerability is risk uncertainty and emotional exposure. And yeah, we don't like it, but it's actually a great way to connect with others and feel true belonging. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I think going off of brene brown you need to be.  We've gotten so used to being comfortable and having things be easy that we don't know how to sit with that feeling anymore. I do believe that that's true and it experienced it myself. So I'm working on when I'm in those uncomfortable situations to  one wrap my head around the fact that this is temporary and to being like, okay, let's just get curious about this. How does it feel that's been a big thing is when I've had these emotions that I don't necessarily like to have the uncomfortable is to get curious about where I feel it in my body. Like I know now that anger is tension in my jaw and teeth anxiety is in my chest. I kind of almost tingly feeling in my upper chest near my clavicle and at times it connects directly behind my eyelids to the point where I'm going to cry so it's really interesting to buy knowing what they physically feel like I can identify them either while or even sometimes before they are happening so I can kind of check in with myself and see what's going on. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	A lot of times it's when I have things at UPS like oh I need to get this done, but I don't because of I mean whether it's I feel sick or just not in a good headspace today. So just kind of like Allison says, you know by the end of the day what needed to get done got done cuz if it needed to get done I got done if it did need to get them that I didn't get done to just knowing that, you know, I don't have to be perfect. I don't have to do.  Everything even things that I say I'm going to do and that's okay. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Because of the playlist I was listening to it was one of never used before so the songs were surprised me in a lot of them were once I knew and that made me smile. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I don't know what the pcpc is. I'm trying to think of what I said. Oh, no, I didn't say PC for computer PC. I don't understand your question.  But did I just really fat note? That wouldn't get.  Final Fantasy serah getting the Final Fantasy 4. Thank Final Fantasy is a video game.  I'm sorry, man. I really don't get it. So that's going to be the best I can give you. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Can excuse me I can I'm just remote and I'm grateful for that. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	In this case, you wouldn't be able to if you didn't know or is it the reader the character didn't know.  but  you can separate that have either the character know where the audience know, LOL. But in this case, it's best to have the context needed for the question to show. Why does it say Capelli question happened before you launch the question? 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	There's a double negative in there that's tripping me out. But I'm thankful that I can have an off-day because sometimes you're going to be up. Sometimes you got to be down and that's okay. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	All this time, it's difficult cuz it's using the skill. We've never really used before but that's the point is for us to see ways we can improve. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	After work when my mom gets done with work. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Knowing if they did the Dum Dums cuz podcasts are amazing. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I haven't submitted it yet. Just cuz I want to do one sign a little lookie-loo and to make sure that you know, everything's structured structurally make sound so it'll be an easy, right? 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	We got to get to the casino so we can set up in time before the band gets there. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I was writing a  Heart of Darkness exercise peace and there was just a lot of trauma present in the character's past actions as well as the present ones that come to pass. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Main one that sticks out is actually finishing those chunks of my script. Also. I did get my two free Bluetooth wireless headsets for like hands-free talking. So that was pretty neat. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	A new webcomic of one that I like to read came out today, so I got to read that. Yay. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	best part well  I really did like reading.  The difference of the different books I'm reading so whether it's brene brown or whether it's tough with the infj. It's just really nice to understand myself better. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	You're the best thing that happened was me finishing my old line. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I would like to remember mine and Dad's chat on the way in just about kind of political ideologies and intuition. It was need to see his kind of connect an intuitive level. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	we  got a small little tip, which was nice and  do my homework in and not happen to have that way on my mind. Good. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Probably watching them couple episodes of queer eye. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	We did a deep clean Amber Room found ten bucks for each bus and dozen eggs each. There's also a single swan out at the damn, but he didn't show me his butt, but that was okay. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	most memorable part of my day  what was  when Paige and I had to go do a maid service on one of the rooms and they must have been there for a long time because they have Christmas stockings up with a Christmas tree, but doesn't really need things like they had alibata little mini arcade game think so that was interesting to see 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Superficial but I was happy that I was able to get a panda planner at like half off. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I bet you feel good today cuz he helped fill up our van with gas and fill its tires with air. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	They're bunch of swans that hang out in the damn know that it's cold enough. And when I was on my way home, I got to see them fishing. So I got to see their little butts and feet hanging up in the air and that was really fun. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	my mom and dad just to get  different perspectives in the tooth going on their lives 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I just really enjoyed that while I was revising and editing my script and going through at that. I you know was sort of in that flow state of all sin. The next thing I know it was a two-star Banks because I was having so much fun and enjoying going through and just letting things spitball and testing ideas that kind of almost made me just forget about time and everything else. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Oh we talked about how our winter uniform should be fleece pajama onesies. That was funny. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I actually really enjoyed doing my homework for my television or a class because I  took notes on it before of generally what my answers were going to be but is able to delve further into it. So it got me to sort of kind of plan and see the story a little bit clearer and ways in which I'm going to fictionalize some more true events. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Well, Dad played at Jack Pine brewery. So Mom and I went to go watch and had a beer or two while we sat and listened to and play. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Being able to be out of the house and getting a $20 tip. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I would definitely see my most memorable was getting my my pages read and  evaluate is not the word but discussed in class. I was sort of expecting it to be like the most nerve-wracking ever because they having to have it be read aloud and be hearing what other people thought of it essentially but because of the way it's framed as them saying their experience, so it cannot be neither right nor wrong. It just is that I think really helped and I was able to go in with an intention of just listening to what they felt and using that to basically make the draft more awesome. So  It leads me to want to.  Develop a writers group that has that same sort of mentality of we're not giving notes as far as like this needs or whatever. It's were saying our experiences. So I think that is very valuable. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Actually fell asleep for like 10 seconds during our second meditation in class. So that was kind of memorable and funny and Reno Houdini doubt if his lead against that was interesting. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Let's see. I got to see a swan, but when I came home also, we got tipped in one of the rooms so I got like $5. Yay. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I would say it was when I went to the gym and I had a very nice run. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Probably let go of expectations I have for myself and my writing.  And just sort of let it let it be and let it flow. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Listening to my Dax Shepard and Dan Savage podcast. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	when I went to bring the car and it was funny because  I was getting some anxiety about it. Like my heart was racing and I was going over things in my head and it was funny cuz I just kept repeating. The thing from hammerfell is jesser Allison where it's like, you know, when you do something that's uncomfortable your anxiety cracks up and it's out of your comfort zone. Your body is basically thinking you're going to die. So I kept telling myself you are not going to die. You are not going to die, laughing at myself as I'm having a bit of an anxiety ramp up. So that was it was good for me to experience and know that it's you know, it's feeling like this now, it's not very good feeling but you know what it will pass. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I'll say something up for Dad's solo gig and then Heaven lunch. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I saw a pair of bald eagle sitting together on a radio tower and that made me happy. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	The cat was laying in a funny spot on the couch. So I took a picture. So we'll say that that was memorable. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	My dad was really the one I hung out with those funny went to dinner and just kind of children watched movies. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	playing the dice game for present swap  and  watching queer eye and posting my thick. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	the most memorable part of my day  was we're just going to say having pizza at Bay rally. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I think the best part was driving back from Duluth where I just did some voice recordings of issues. I was having a my script and talk to them through and fighting solutions for them. That should work overall. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	memorable moment would be  Guess what I can think of right now is going to see 1917. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	memorable moment from my day  I guess was talking to our old neighbor Kurt on the phone. His sister was over to go over some stuff with my mom they called.  She's be so they were busy. So I chat with my other phone for a bit. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I guess just sharing stories with two of my uncles. I really enjoy talking to my uncle John about all my travel stuff. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I was watching the Robbie's Blog videos and just became axon gray make me giggle and laugh. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I'm grateful for my relationship with my father we get on really well and we understand each other sometimes. Even is really having to talk. So it's nice to be able to let your guard down and just get that someone gets you. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I'm grateful I get to do my little travel Adventures. Those are a lot of fun. I'm looking forward to the one coming up with my sister and her boys as well as my trip to Chicago. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Catherine her and I can just pick up right where we left off no matter how long it's been. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Some things that I remember standing out is that there was one girl that wore to sunglasses at once for some reason also when we were sitting at the picnic table talking there was a Burr Oak tree that had part of its limbs severed off that was going into the street.  Biggest thing to is that I would I was trying to connect with the new girls that came in and the one was sweet and she tried to make an effort and then I popped up on things and give her compliments but the other girl just sort of put me down at every turn at one point. She took my knee and essentially told me that you know who you're talkin about it. Everything and nobody cares in a member just having that you know that a horrible feeling in my like my chest might got to let you know. I'm fine if people don't like me, but this girl was just so caught taking so outright kind of aggressive about it.  That it really made me just feel horrible. So I quickly was a guy and I got to get breakfast or dinner or whatever meal it is right now. Goodbye. And then I just left like a child and I felt horrible and then I got to the actual food line, but I realize I had no idea.  with plates were  how to get food I wasn't even hungry but I looked over near the cooler and they had like a slice of pizza and hot dogs and stuff and I just kind of  was almost overwhelmed with choice in and that's when I woke up. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I think you misheard me. I never said anything about a pilot's license, so I'm not really bummed about missing it. Oh.  Give me my Pilots.  I mean  You know, it's it's just wrapping your head around the idea that none of your effort is wasted I have to go through through these iterations for my pilot in order to figure it all out and eventually create the final product. That is ideal. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	You actually posed a very good question. And the reason brene Brown says shame is not good because shame if something that is linked to Identity. So instead of saying I did a bad thing or like I stole that it's I'm a thief and then especially at a young age when that gets engraved inside of you. That's how much she says there that suggests us anymore. That's how you know, you create sociopaths and Psychopaths is because they they believe that that is who they are because they have been shamed into it. We're as if they were guilted in it where it's a Gilt cordless to behavior. You did something wrong you you stole that it would ever Then you can correct it, but it doesn't Define you as you are. You don't see yourself as like I am a thief I am a bad person. I am a narcissist, you know, you just say that the I had this  I did this behavior and it you know wasn't good because of this that the other and I can change that in the future. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	There's just a bit of velcro. That's all. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	No, I want to try and do exposure therapy when it comes to having control over my riding cuz I believe it will serve me and help me continue to get through my writing work. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Is that a first grade reading class everywhere? It's not unfortunate. It's good. I'm excited to stretch my  Boundaries isn't the right word but to take that feeling of discomfort and sit with it longer so that I can grow. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	The best thing was probably watching Robbie's video and seeing him Max and Ray again and just getting a chuckle out of watching them. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Well, the thing that probably will be remembered is that Trump was impeached I like to remember is the day of the five Swan butts. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	Going in the ditch. This morning was a significant memory and then everybody making fun of me afterwards. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	memorable moment for today  possibly  I guess picking up my library book or  Oh, what's it called him out to lunch my parents and my dad showed us some weird videos of a grandma getting sucked into a garbage bag. So I guess that was something memorable. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I’m thankful to have traveled abroad
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I started off nice and chill with my coffee and my meditative sessions that I banged up my homework really quick got a little bit of reading in help. My sister took care of some household stuff. And then I had my screenwriting Alchemy class where my material was looked at and I got some really nice information from the other riders in the class about their experience of what I had on the page that helped reinforce that I was hitting certain marks. I was intending and dumb certain questions were being asked which is what I intended and that overall it seems like it's in a good place. Where would I am intending the experience to be is actually being the experience of others. So that's really great. Then I had a quick little break to grab something to eat. My meditative writing class went well also is a bit more tired for that one, but I was still able to get good stuff out of it. And then I also purchased a intuitive writer class. Yay at a discounted rate that I can do at my leisure and I was able to get a digital course and tell us M&R for riding through Jen grisanti actually half-price from herb discounted because by My gift card at purchase. They said just went towards all of it, even though I technically still had to pay $50. So I paid that money forward that I saved and donated to help.  squelch the wildfires in Australia 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I was able to get a ton of stuff done. Basically everything on my to-do list safe for things that end up getting pushed back. I was able to finish my projects and get them sent off and overall. It was just an awesome day. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I was able to get all the big to do things done off my list starting with finishing and turning in my homework doing my daily homework doing a meditative writing exercise watching videos for one two, three of my classes getting some errands done in town and finding some books. I didn't expect to a library. That was great watching a couple new shows and feeling very accomplished. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I was able to have time to myself I  completed my homework got caught up on some videos for other classes did some reading watched one of my favorite TV show did some household cleaning and just got everything done on my list. 
EJAtM6b8J6gdkUDLbnmbmHFrmA83	I was able to accomplish so many things all the stuff for my little to do to get to do list. One of the things that really made it good was when I was working on my script and just kind of playing around in sections that I knew needed to be addressed and just not really being too strict on this is the way it has to be active on the perfect way, but just finding different ways of playing it out. It was really enjoyable and to the point where I'm pretty sure worked on it for a couple hours and didn't even realize it all the sudden. I just got hungry so nice to start being that flow Zone. And to remind myself when you know, when I get that resistant to I don't want to work on it to remind myself that put it feel so good when you do it.

ESAgQrF1vNacF2e7oKFkqEuOL213	Well I got in trouble with my parents, and they think I’m lying about this one thing that happened. But anyway I though I was going to get yelled at as per the usual, but they sat me down and talked to me and it made me feel a lot better. Usually I just get really upset.

Er029aBtr6PDfn3L5KjMFHkJnjk2	I am okay like the first message that it's all over but the spring semester. I think I'm going to be nervous for a while just because it's a hard class. It's my last message. I have to feel release and relief for being done and being last but at the same time as I really need to get these glasses on and going because otherwise I will have a very tough time with you have. 
Er029aBtr6PDfn3L5KjMFHkJnjk2	He usually will either like I think it was more of you wants to make a cake and teach me how to play video game. So I'll do that. 
Er029aBtr6PDfn3L5KjMFHkJnjk2	He knows I'm very well. He's been playing them for years. I just have never really gotten into them. 
Er029aBtr6PDfn3L5KjMFHkJnjk2	I think it ends in like May.  But yeah, that's a couple months. 
Er029aBtr6PDfn3L5KjMFHkJnjk2	What is that? I don't have to work out today. 
Er029aBtr6PDfn3L5KjMFHkJnjk2	There was something about that.  Sometime since my can be disappointing but it depends on how you look at it because things can always turn up just like the, show 1/2. It may have not been as greater that helped, but it was still a good experience and help me come out of my anxious mood and being a better mood and I was also able to have some laughs and spend time with people I care about 
Er029aBtr6PDfn3L5KjMFHkJnjk2	That I really want to join the my arrest couple of days with Zachary doing anything he wants to. 
Er029aBtr6PDfn3L5KjMFHkJnjk2	Nothing, really.  Frosting that I probably need to do something new for my workout or you but more challenging.  If you do yoga in the stars or something so that I can warm up my body.  And make sure I read my book everyday because I like to eat comes me down.  and  I've been thinking about needing to have more social life, but I don't really have that.  Lately, I've been doing things like every single day and it's starting to really wear me out.  I'm trying to play.  feel like  feel claustrophobic in some like it but at the same time I know that it's better for me to be socially awkward and doing things with people then.  Locking myself in and then going crazy from not having any social connections. 
Er029aBtr6PDfn3L5KjMFHkJnjk2	I'm good enough just as I can I am. 
Er029aBtr6PDfn3L5KjMFHkJnjk2	possibly playing games at the nearest party  That is absolutely and I'm very upset. 
Er029aBtr6PDfn3L5KjMFHkJnjk2	I think spending time with my friend because I haven't seen her in a while. 
Er029aBtr6PDfn3L5KjMFHkJnjk2	I think the comedy show because it'll be a relief but I'm debating if I want to get high or if I just want to.  Go there sober. 
Er029aBtr6PDfn3L5KjMFHkJnjk2	having pizza with my boyfriend 
Er029aBtr6PDfn3L5KjMFHkJnjk2	I think I'm most looking forward to just seeing my boyfriend. I'm also pretty sad about the movie but  Just be my boyfriend. 
Er029aBtr6PDfn3L5KjMFHkJnjk2	spending time with my boyfriend 
Er029aBtr6PDfn3L5KjMFHkJnjk2	Play games with my boyfriend. 
Er029aBtr6PDfn3L5KjMFHkJnjk2	Cleaning my grandma's house going to the comedy show and eating dinner with my boyfriend's family before we go to, she'll want to reading my book that's real important to me. 
Er029aBtr6PDfn3L5KjMFHkJnjk2	Well, I got a breakfast workouts in my book. And after that I really just got to.  See, whatever. I can do my order. I talked to her yesterday about getting those Xbox connected into my house along with an old controller so I can play one of the games. He exposed me to yesterday. I never liked.  And then I'm pretty sure and then tonight we're supposed to go out with his family and after that see movie. So yeah. 
Er029aBtr6PDfn3L5KjMFHkJnjk2	We watched bombshell today bombshell the movie End.  I know it just seemed.  I was very touched by it. 
Er029aBtr6PDfn3L5KjMFHkJnjk2	I think I'm just glad that my boyfriend had me come to this party and  let myself lose. I just enjoy my night. 
Er029aBtr6PDfn3L5KjMFHkJnjk2	All good. Well actually a few days ago.  I was eating dinner with my boyfriend's family and after dinner.  He said something that I talked to him over text. I told him that I thought his sister was very competitive and then made me feel.  uneasy around her and he mentioned those are the exact words at 7 and text in front of her and I simply responded with thanks for talking about my diary and I want  we want to borrow everything and he doesn't even remember. But  I felt my trust for him leave a little bit.  The tiniest little pain trust leave and then it is slowly starting to smooth over and we kind of forgetting it but at the same time still feel like I don't trust him right now. Like I can't tell him everything in like Bob said in the slightest bit. How does cuddle upset with me and then I'll just not feel comfortable at something. I don't feel completely comfortable around right now, and I don't like it. 
Er029aBtr6PDfn3L5KjMFHkJnjk2	I've trusted myself to make the right decisions. 
Er029aBtr6PDfn3L5KjMFHkJnjk2	Enjoy being present in the moment. 
Er029aBtr6PDfn3L5KjMFHkJnjk2	I had a bad day or anxiety attack and Eliza for very long time and I just felt very sad and just not very happy and it took me a long time today to get through that. 
Er029aBtr6PDfn3L5KjMFHkJnjk2	just not going to very easy day emotionally speaking and  then I'll try to play some Xbox and all these games are too hard challenging and I don't get any of them. I keep dying even in the story games. Send.  It's just making me feel like maybe I'm just too much for me. 
Er029aBtr6PDfn3L5KjMFHkJnjk2	I ended up not doing much at all. I watched TV for hours and a friend of mine came over we talked and now I'm talking to my boyfriend about things that  Just seem to be issues in a relationship like two small things that we need to talk about and every time I talk to him about it, I always feel like I do something wrong. So today I felt run-of-the-mill because it didn't really do much for most of the day and now that it is ending, of course, there's stuff happening. 
Er029aBtr6PDfn3L5KjMFHkJnjk2	Way too much stuff. I have to eat breakfast workout to like 40 and my boyfriend that he thinks we're going to make and we are because we are going to be ready before like 1 or 2 p.m.  And then any other day he wants it all to be magically done before the New Year's party next on how things happen. 
Er029aBtr6PDfn3L5KjMFHkJnjk2	Sex and sleep very well and very long.  Because it was fake last night.  Today just have basic thing left to do everything is going to fix so much so long. I'm tired. 
Er029aBtr6PDfn3L5KjMFHkJnjk2	I definitely feel like I got a lot done today. I spent hours in my bedroom watching TV becoming is okay. It's Monday and I might as well buy myself one day to really rest, but I definitely don't feel that anything that are day. I feel good that I have put a lot of effort into being emotionally honest voicing my emotions, but  I don't think I got a lot done today at all. 
Er029aBtr6PDfn3L5KjMFHkJnjk2	$2 back and forth I was able to work out shower read then watch V for a couple hours how to swim a down. Dad and both ones and then later. I am currently attending a New Year's party. So that's good. 
Er029aBtr6PDfn3L5KjMFHkJnjk2	Well the word out what was not really cold but something I want to do.  Then I read my book with saw something I wanted to do and I went to dinner and suspend on my boyfriend.  But I feel like my times been going away lightning. I don't really have a whole lot of time to spend doing things. I want to do during the day. Maybe I just need to like Bella back and go to bed earlier, but I I've been wanting to stay out later. So that on New Years. I'll be able to stay awake late. 
Er029aBtr6PDfn3L5KjMFHkJnjk2	Well actually have read my book yet, but I might read it tonight, but I did get a new eyebrow pencil. I did go to, Jean and to spend time with people so.  The majority of all my goals are reached. 
Er029aBtr6PDfn3L5KjMFHkJnjk2	Stream, okay with everything today. I'm just happy that my mom made me a progress today that I can eat this morning and she's filled with protein and I can eat that and then workout.  I'm just happy. 
Er029aBtr6PDfn3L5KjMFHkJnjk2	I don't know.  I think I'm just thankful that I don't have a job right now because otherwise I probably would not be able to sleep as late and I that currently doing so because if I probably have to work.  Which means getting up early? 
Er029aBtr6PDfn3L5KjMFHkJnjk2	I clean my grandparents house. I was paid $25, which was nice that I went back home and showered an out with my boyfriend to Coconut Mall and I bought myself a new brow pencil which was $23. So basically I'm a money game today at also spend then after that we went to his house and well, I we had dinner with his family and then me having a sister went to a comedy show which was and after that we drove back to the house and then  Him and I went to a diner close by and had a pancake. We shared one and decided to take so it's been an okay day. 
Er029aBtr6PDfn3L5KjMFHkJnjk2	I did everything I want to do today. 
Er029aBtr6PDfn3L5KjMFHkJnjk2	when I woke up I  It was 12 p.m. And I was sad about hasn't gotten up late. Then. I ate breakfast went to the gym worked out, but I didn't feel like I was making any progress because it's the gym and I don't really feel any pain and I feel like I'm supposed to help a normal workout.  Then I'm at home showered her notebook and then out to eat with my grandparents parents and boyfriend and then I had dinner with them went. Okay, and then we left to my boyfriend's house to watch a movie with his family.  and  After the movie is over. We watched a couple trailers any Parks and Rec episode and I  I don't know what it was.  He told me about that. He'd rather have it if I told him I want rather than just wanting him to assume or guess what I wanted from noises that make and  it got to me.  Because I felt it was angry or upset with me.  And I cut myself off.  I think I'm just really afraid of him leaving me someday because I can't handle my emotions and I don't know how to do deal with them and I'm still working on it and it's a really rough. 
Er029aBtr6PDfn3L5KjMFHkJnjk2	Elastic it up.  Probably do some morning yoga.  eat breakfast  can most likely be there book get ready for the day and I don't know either do something or boyfriend or I'll do something with my friend help. 
Er029aBtr6PDfn3L5KjMFHkJnjk2	I suppose I wasn't as I am twist able yorgos. I am today, even though I still don't have a job. I manage my money differently and  I've also established a different kind of trust with my boyfriend. 
Er029aBtr6PDfn3L5KjMFHkJnjk2	I think I've been feeling thankful for the time that the winter break has given me even though I don't always loved every single day and sometimes the days feel very pack and short I still feel grateful for the fact that I had the time to just relax to do things with people become a social person because normally throughout the semester and very stressed. I don't have time and I'm always smart as finding excuses not to spend time with my family with friends with people outside of my regular collect my parents my boyfriend's family and my grandparents are pretty much two people. I see every weekend heat and I don't normally make time to see my friends rather people and this break after they've been seeing not necessarily a whole lot more people, but I've been doing a lot of activity center Church forced me to be walking out there and just have fun. 
Er029aBtr6PDfn3L5KjMFHkJnjk2	my boyfriend  he always tries to be there for me emotionally and physically he tries to give me anxiety hugs or trust him hugging you the tightly.  and  so it's really nice, but  sometimes he doesn't really know how to be around me when  I have an emotional block and I don't know how to deal with it. So.  I'm grateful for him all the time because he managed to do with me and love me despite all my errors, but  it's really hard when I feel like I disappointed him.  Anna p.m. Tomorrow to convey a vocalist on my on my emotions are at 
Er029aBtr6PDfn3L5KjMFHkJnjk2	I think I'm grateful for having considered this ritual of come to the sap and invoicing my emotional reactions.  And doing yoga and talking to a friend about something.  And about twice to happen a while ago.  And just stole the understanding that somewhere Dooney Defender doesn't have to tell you it was going to be my boyfriend or person it can be something like an app. I could just talk to I can voice my things and avoid something that's different than just thinking it. 
Er029aBtr6PDfn3L5KjMFHkJnjk2	Watching a political movie about Texas in with my boyfriend. 
Er029aBtr6PDfn3L5KjMFHkJnjk2	My boyfriend has been very kind and generous to me today trying to make me feel as comfortable emotionally as a code.

Er029aBtr6PDfn3L5KjMFHkJnjk2	For some reason seem to be mostly very unstable today like anything small goes wrong, and I'm set off. I'm very upset. 
Er029aBtr6PDfn3L5KjMFHkJnjk2	Maybe doing yoga or spend time with my friend. 
Er029aBtr6PDfn3L5KjMFHkJnjk2	The fact that I don't have to worry about food being in the fridge for only Tuesday always there. 
Er029aBtr6PDfn3L5KjMFHkJnjk2	I think I'm actually kind of grateful for time and my boyfriend and myself mostly I think myself because I'm actually happy if I won the best going even though I don't know where everything is going to hell. I didn't clean turn out yet. Have you bout it?

F9MDRdSLIeXVOGQ4NynwS5AFAQi2	searching through the App Store 
FDYgLl2UnnPjUX76feBC1aChRS23	considering that  the piece of paper  Controls your whole future.  Panera  probably a little bit but not to the point where you're super stressed out. Maybe just  try hard in school to be successful. And if you're not successful, then don't stress about it. Just make the best of it. 
FDYgLl2UnnPjUX76feBC1aChRS23	Well, normally I freaked out and I'm rude but I'm  Starting to realize that it's affecting my own mental health. So I'm going to start meditating and doing more yoga.  When I get stressed out and do things I enjoy like play with my animals. 
FDYgLl2UnnPjUX76feBC1aChRS23	Well, I don't think there's animals on Mars Sol.  I could go to Mars but  I don't think there's animals there. 
FDYgLl2UnnPjUX76feBC1aChRS23	Hold on. I'm not really sure what that meant.  How long do you think it will take for you to get used to being a thot?  Per second being a thought for a second.  I'm confused.  How long do you think it will take for you to get used to being a thought for a second?  Okay, so I'm pretty sure you're talking about yourself. This is pretty cool.  Right now I'm liking it. 
FDYgLl2UnnPjUX76feBC1aChRS23	Probably not too much because it gets kind of exhausting but I mean a little bit of attention is good.  Like if you're famous and you're getting a bunch of money from it, then you could I don't know not have to worry about money, but  I don't know. Sometimes it's good to just know you're completely alone and do not to worry about what everyone else is doing. That's why I don't have social media cuz I'm just in my own little world. Having to do what everybody else is doing. 
FDYgLl2UnnPjUX76feBC1aChRS23	I would say.  I really like to hear that. It's all going to be. Okay and you do you can do whatever you want to do and that there's  not a lot of time so just do what you want.  and I would say  probably, let myself cuz I have been kind of insecure lately. So hearing somebody compliment might feel a little good. 
FDYgLl2UnnPjUX76feBC1aChRS23	I don't know what  being a thot means  I'm confused.  Should you be happy if you're happy?  What?  I'm so confused.  Like I don't know you mean. 
FDYgLl2UnnPjUX76feBC1aChRS23	I just saw it on the App Store. 
FDYgLl2UnnPjUX76feBC1aChRS23	I woke up pretty stressed out. I was in a super bad mood and then I went to church and Craig told me to just thought about Chevron I guess and then shove and watch it. So we figured it out a lot of things. I hope.  And then I figured out that I have my own set of opinions and personality and that I don't even have the same as my dad. You're not a thought for so long that I had to or just did.  I don't.  And now I'm just kind of excited that to know that I'm my own person. You literally can do what I want because we're all going to die one day. 
FDYgLl2UnnPjUX76feBC1aChRS23	Well, we would never go to heaven.  and eventually  we probably all just get really sick of each other.  I'll be kind of cool though, cuz I nobody would be sad but I mean  we have to go to heaven one day. 
FDYgLl2UnnPjUX76feBC1aChRS23	Well, that would kind of suck because food is good. 
FDYgLl2UnnPjUX76feBC1aChRS23	Yeah, pretty good. I figured out my mental health.  That's pretty much the highlight of my day. 
FDYgLl2UnnPjUX76feBC1aChRS23	I didn't do much today. I went to the thrift store with my mom because she asked me to but I was kind of stressed out.  but then it turned out kind of fun because  I got a new shirt that I have on right now and then we came back and  I  also show up. So Chevron at the carwash.  And then I came back here and hang out with her family and now I'm in bed and I just did some meditation so I can't complain.  I also went to church this morning. 
FDYgLl2UnnPjUX76feBC1aChRS23	I really enjoyed hugging Cheveron.  And I also enjoyed going to the thrift store with my mom and smelling all the incense and putting it in my car and just decluttering my room and my shower was also good. I enjoyed a lot of things today.  And I want to realize that if I wasn't talking to you right now, so I guess thank you. 
FDYgLl2UnnPjUX76feBC1aChRS23	I would go visit but not live there. I like the Earth for those animals in.  family  introverted 
FDYgLl2UnnPjUX76feBC1aChRS23	I would relive.  Probably like a super younger age.  Cuz I didn't stress about anything.  And I was always getting attention from everybody cuz I was funny.  to Premier League 2000  67 Niles like little bit  older than 4/5 
FDYgLl2UnnPjUX76feBC1aChRS23	No, I'm saying I like the animals.  So I wouldn't want to go to Mars because I like animals and my family. 
FDYgLl2UnnPjUX76feBC1aChRS23	I'm not sure you just go mentally your soul goes to heaven.

FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	last year  I used to go to Galveston. Sometimes I would go alone to have fun.  and  I really feel like going out with my cousin back then.  Then I miss my family. I miss going out with my family.  And talking to my best friend. She's not my best friend anymore. 
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	Normally I wouldn’t, but the way he reacted kept me thinking 
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	I don’t understand the question 
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	Yeah, it was really nice. 
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	It helps because being persistent helps achieve your goals and it doesn't keep you in the same place and makes you look out to better places and always keep pushing through and I know I can get to a better place in life. 
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	We live together, I’m in bed with him right now.
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	I sometimes feel unloved because he doesn’t want to spend time with me. He’s not the type to brings you flowers and stuff so I honestly long for romantic gestures. He often feels bothered because I don’t give him enough alone time. 
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	I felt like the whole time Mrs. Jakino’s daughters were judging me because they kept staring at me and they wouldn’t say a word to me. They looked stern and I feel like they’re going to complain to my company about me. I also felt like I stink because I didn’t have time to shower this morning. One of the daughters said whispering “she’s nasty” which made me feel like she was talking about me. I felt very uncomfortable and insecure 
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	Probably talk to my roommate and make sure he understands what I think about the situation

FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	I tried taking deep breaths and thinking about anything else 
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	Well, I found an apartment for 650. So I'll probably get that one. I found out how to make a dress out of a T-shirt. 
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	I’m starting to think I might not love my boyfriend anymore 
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	I thought about starting bike riding on a trail near home. And about making seat covers with the new sewing machine my boyfriend got me for Christmas.
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	No, everything was just like always 
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	I can clean the house go for a run.  Go bike riding.  Take a long bath. 
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	I'm crying and just broke up with me. 
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	I am in love with a human. 
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	My relationship has been going like shit and all I can think about is dying at night. 
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	For him to change his goddamn attitude and start lifting a finger for once
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	That he would’ve been less paranoid about it, it makes me think that something is going on behind my back
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	I'm not really looking forward to anything. I feel like today is just going to be one of those stupid days or I just  kid lost in the routine.  And it's just the same old thing. 
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	I'm looking forward to having a great day and coming back home and seeing Ed and relaxing and taking a good bath. 
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	Cleaning out my Jeep to go to Mexico and reading my book and at the end of the day doing my yoga to go to sleep. 
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	Working on my seat covers and working on myself as a person
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	Try to stay calm I’ve made it this far 
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	I don’t think I had any good parts
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	I got to relax with a bath today
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	When I woke up next to Ed. 
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	To make my days more memorable 
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	This morning. I will get up have my morning coffee. I will have probably an Egg and I will read my book and I'll watch the news and then I'll go deposit that money and needs me to go take the money order and then I'll go to work for an hour.  And then I'll come back and start preparing everything for my trip to Mexico. 
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	I will go to work this morning and I'll get off at 6 and I'll go workout right after I go to work and at night. I'll do my beauty routine and I'll just try to relax. 
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	Because I feel like I’m being disrespected and that I don’t have a voice or vote in the house 
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	Because while I stayed silent my boyfriend was asking me questions like “what’s wrong?” I didn’t respond because I knew I was going to say something stupid
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	Well everything was going fine but earlier I almost caused a car crash, I felt like an idiot I should’ve payed more attention 
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	I didn’t get much sleep because I worked overnight and there wasn’t really anything special going on
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	I need to go to a meeting today.  And then I have to go to an orientation at 1.  And I think that's it for today. 
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	sadness depressed  I feel like I want to die. 
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	Well, I finally sat down and actually started reading a book. I have been wanting to do that and I feel like it's going to help me a lot. 
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	Not much all I did was work
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	All I did was clean the house and go to work
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	I got the room cleaned and I worked. But I feel like I could’ve done more today.
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	I honestly didn’t do anything today
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	You will it it is the best person that I have in my life right now, he helps me a lot and every time I feel bad or something, he always lightens up my mood.  lately, I've been feeling like  I don't know. There's there's just something missing between us lately. 
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	Not really, I know he loves me and he would never do anything to hurt me, at least not on purpose 
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	When Evan crossed the 60mph road very close to oncoming traffic I panicked really bad
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	Not this time, but sometimes I have panic attacks and I start to hyperventilate and sweat
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	This morning. I went to a job interview. It went really well.  Looks like he's opening up even more. He looks like he's comfortable.  and 
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	Angry, upset and let down 
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	Honestly know I don't know what I'm doing and I have no idea what I'm going to do next. I've ran out of goals that I really don't know what I want to do with my life. 
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	I have to go to work at 9:00 this morning with a new client with dementia 
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	My life with Ed, I love how he’s so sweet and supportive. I am very thankful to have a man that loves me so much.
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	the fact that I am  strong and very very persistent  both girls have helped me to push through life ever since I've been on my own. 
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	I was grateful to enjoy Ed's company. 
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	Ed telling me he wants space
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	nothing  I just feel stupid. 
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	That I’m finally realizing I’m not gettin my worth in return, I’m just giving myself away and I have to change that
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	I really look up to Megan Montebello the wife of my boss. She's very professional and she looks like she knows what she's doing and she knows where she wants to go and she's just very beautiful and professional. 
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	I noticed that I’m finally learning to keep quiet until I’m calmed down
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	That I have to consider all variables before moving in with people
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	Nothing I just continued to be angry
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	I feel like I'm getting my life together.  I I'm going to Mexico in a few days and I know this is going to be an awesome day no matter what. 
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	I had my breakfast took my supplements. I showered I brush my teeth. I packed everything that I need and I'm ready for life to throw anything. It wants it me. 
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	My boyfriend is the one who mostly talks to him but when I say something my roommate just gives me a bad attitude so I just keep silent
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	I got up kept silent for a few minutes and said “I’m going to bed”
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	I’m not sure, we live together so I pretty much observe him all the time
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	For being sweet even though I’ve been very emotional 
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	fun  missing fun alone time  there's never time for anything anymore because he's so focused on his life. He's so focused on his music. He's so focused on on getting this house.  I feel like he never has time to go out with me and stuff like that. And yeah, we still spend time at the house, but we don't go out anymore. We don't do anything special together. 
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	I don't go to school. I work. 
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	Because I’m being too easy on my boyfriend, I have to start valuing myself and treating myself how I deserve to be treated 
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	We watch movies together, sometimes we put on music to motivate us to clean our apartment, he likes learning about music but that’s something he does by himself 
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	Getting home to see my wonderful boyfriend.
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	Probably talking to my boyfriend over the phone. I was very happy to hear his voice. 
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	I struggle a lot with giving him his alone time, every now and then he wants me to just give him time by himself but I end up butting in. I love him so much that I want to spend every minute of my day with him, but unfortunately he doesn’t work that way.
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	Well it’s honestly become an everyday thing, I nag because I want to spend quality time with him but he nags because he wants alone time
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	I don't know. I want something to spice of my life, but  everything's just been going so bad lately. 
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	I walked away to our room, now I’m locked up in the darkness talking to you
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	My boyfriend didn't talk to me and all day. 
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	My boyfriend ignored me the whole day
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	I got a to see Mrs. Dishman again and I got off work early. The donut shop girl gave me a free donut this morning. Also I kept my diet yet another day. I stayed positive and I spent wonderful time with my boyfriend. ❤️
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	My roommate won’t clean after himself and never takes responsibility for his cat. I’m always cleaning, emptying out the litter box and washing dishes but he never seems to cooperate. He won’t even put up a dish all he does is get home from work and play video games until his bedtime. His cat steals my cat’s food because he never feeds her. He’s ungrateful, irresponsible, lazy and has a terrible attitude. My boyfriend and I have tried talking to him about everything but we never see him change. At this point I don’t know what to do with him.
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	My boyfriend had pictures of his ex on his phone, when I found them he immediately snatched his phone from my hands and when I asked him to give me the phone back he refused.
FNpCLiATaObglMfq0HWJVFg0uRX2	I was at work taking care of Mrs. Jakino and her two daughters came to visit

He requires me to kind of and I can't because I'm on disability. So it's either I lose my insurance for both my daughter and I  And work more or he can actually do what he's supposed to do and work.

HQ3hDIstcxc6nClm07c8nBDVLbC3	Actually just talking to my husband about this this morning.  We all make mistakes and often times. I feel like I have many experiences where  my word stumble over my tongue and my thoughts don't come together as I would like them to but in each of those moments I challenge myself to reflect and to improve on that weakness and to not be hard on myself and I'm getting better at doing that and strategizing how I'm going to overcome that weakness and for that I'm really proud and grateful for my efforts. 
HQ3hDIstcxc6nClm07c8nBDVLbC3	my husband  he seriously the best and I'm just so happy that we have such a strong marriage and that we are able to communicate.  Add a very deep level and that we Inspire each other to continue to give our very very best in life. 
HQ3hDIstcxc6nClm07c8nBDVLbC3	I drive to improve.  Not to improve for anybody else.  I would definitely say that I experienced a lot of highs and lows in my life.  Reaching. Middle Ground middle balance can be difficult for me.  I'm trying to make better efforts to simplify my life.  + 2  Be more consistent.  Again, because I expect such highs and lows there's Austin.  That time where I'm really engaged really focused on my goals and then something I could get sick or maybe get down on myself for not completing something to the best abilities. I know I have or maybe misunderstanding something that could be a range of different things that I feel like he knocked me down and with that I can shut off easily.  Kind of going to that negative. What's the point mindset?  I am always looking for.  Somebody else to tell me this is exactly what you need to do. And this is going to fix everything.  But I tend to put other people on a pedestal.  They have it all figured out.  Which is not the case.  Probably more often not true. Then it is true.  and with that ultimately  I would like to get to this place where?  I can still engaged and happy and present in the things. I'm doing on a daily basis and realize that they're still going to be moments where I'm tired or not able to give 100%  but to jump back into it or pull up as quickly as I can and to not burn myself out and and by simplifying  Many areas in my life and being consistent in in the resources or the apps or the habits. I'm creating.  on a daily basis so that I  turn out any of this unnecessary.  Look for other.  Better improved resources that end up just ultimately distracting me and make me feel overwhelmed by all the things that are out there that I could I could look to that sir. I could read that sir. I could do this and maybe this will be the one thing that fixes it instead of like my career instead of sticking with what I'm doing and  growing in that goal  So with that I want to be consistent in the house when I'm using now that doesn't necessarily mean that some of the apps I'm using. It may not be one that I drop at some point if I feel like it's too tedious for me to keep up with.  I think a raw and again, I'm at that moment where I feel really engaged, but I need to be careful that.  I mean cognizant of not wearing myself out and looking down, but I definitely want to get two aspects of being more proactive having more energy. 
HQ3hDIstcxc6nClm07c8nBDVLbC3	Hey, Remy, today was a pretty active day. I was able to get a lot of chores completed and then we were able to head up to families house and spend some time.  Cooking tuna and chatting with my husband's parents and now I am getting ready for bed. 
HQ3hDIstcxc6nClm07c8nBDVLbC3	Hey Remy.  This morning didn't sound start off to great.  And then I was feeling a bit down today. I did something Dipsy and  I thinking about it, but try to move past it and I feel that I did and ultimately and came home and  Have any really good evening with my husband?  Ended off on a good note. My husband is likely going to get a promotion and so we are really excited about that and again talking about the possibilities. 
HQ3hDIstcxc6nClm07c8nBDVLbC3	Hey Remy, today I was able to go on a 5K run throughout this week. I've unfortunately been feeling sick. So was not expecting that I would do my very best and this 5K run but ultimately ended up being a boss and typically 5K takes me over 30 minutes at a pace of around 10 and 1/2 or 10.5 miles per hour or 11 miles per hour and today and said I read it raining at 26.51. Minutes and was able to get down to a pace of a little over eight miles per hour. So I was real proud of myself today. I feel ignited to work on some long-term goals and to better my communication. So that's why I'm using this app now so excited to see if this works for me and then I'm about to go out and run some errands.

HQ3hDIstcxc6nClm07c8nBDVLbC3	I just feel really energized again my goals to work on my communication instead of making me feel more insecure have actually made me feel feel more confident in myself and my abilities to learn and grow. 
HQ3hDIstcxc6nClm07c8nBDVLbC3	I think you mean how does he give his best? She sets goals and he's able to set up a routine that matches.  His is going and timeline for meeting that goal.

HVe1io3GGvX8E1g6DSnFe5lz9pi2	Of coarse all the time. I feel like I can’t succeed in all I want to do. I feel like I won’t ever date anyone bc no one will like me. I have big dreams and it’s hard to know what’s going to happen till it actually happens
HVe1io3GGvX8E1g6DSnFe5lz9pi2	I would be angry at whose doing it and ask why some things specifically are happening to me if they can control it

HVe1io3GGvX8E1g6DSnFe5lz9pi2	Oh yes it would change everything. I would have told my parents I want to act by now. I would be doing a lot more with my life rather than just sitting back and hoping because hoping gets you nowhere 
HVe1io3GGvX8E1g6DSnFe5lz9pi2	It would be super creepy and I would want to talk to the person running asking why some things are happening to me

HXhTFuEwqTO9ALAJulIXEyZwjDz2	I would probably be a husky just cuz I can go out and awards and be wild and do anyting. You know, if I were to kill an animal to do it, I would be a husky. 
HXhTFuEwqTO9ALAJulIXEyZwjDz2	Yes, I know it would be kind of difficult. But as my favorite animal I have one so I would like to be husky just cuz you're crazy in they probably do anything they want so.

IT0FCEP8CfONigBSTa9cxVjypzW2	Not today just threw out the grieving process after the divorce.  and  my kind of Deep dive into the pain.  I've been a world-class stuff for my whole life because that was really the examples that for me stuff or explode.  And the explosions were just unacceptable to me. So, you know like a good Christian girl. I  Would cry quietly privately.  And then keep moving forward.  There's the unusual circumstance where we are roommates which is been very problematic for my healing because it feels as though I've always got an audience making little judgments about every little thing that I do or don't do when I come to a place.  of healing and let's say  I make some statement about not wanting to be my room so much. There's this very passive-aggressive judgment all thank God it's about time with just like disgust and it's just an acceptable. It's so immature and I really been dealing with it my entire life and I think what makes it so ridiculous is  The level of deception she lived under herself. She's never dealt with a single thing and refuses to but yet seems to spend you know.  All of her free time or hasn't. Judging me. I don't know what she does now. We no longer have a relationship.  because of the toxicity  so  it's like that's a  that replays itself.  When I get into deep waves of emotion.  the judgments that Expressions that  aggressive comments  just never seeming to find an ear that's listening accepting acknowledging really from anyone.  but I think so desperately needing that trying to sort through that not just the grief of a divorce and the grief of my newfound poverty and my grief of having no one's help or support but also the grief of now dealing with  Undealt with trauma from being in an abusive marriage for 13 years.  And then the traumas having all of these interactions with people.  Who don't care don't even.  Ask her sympathize.  Which is that all compounded by the fact that I'm a deeply in bathetic person. So then I feel all of that.  Kind of rejection probably within triple Force. 
IT0FCEP8CfONigBSTa9cxVjypzW2	That's not even a real question should not be there, but it's like depth at the Hertz and what else we need to work on.  work on these questions  I don't have anything set. 
IT0FCEP8CfONigBSTa9cxVjypzW2	I don't know that I understand the question.  Would you say you know, this is not something that helps you cope with pain?  I don't know. Maybe that's  why I let the loneliness fesser.  Because it was a way that I was coping with pain. I'm not I'm not really sure. 
IT0FCEP8CfONigBSTa9cxVjypzW2	Should have been accepted.  Yeah, I think it should have been accepted. I think it should have been acceptable for me to grieve without judgment and for me to walk a very winding messy path.  of healing and dealing  without an audience  without judgmental eyes and Huffs and puffs and  just all of her toxicity really it's compounded it sometimes tenfold.  And I'm angry about it. 
IT0FCEP8CfONigBSTa9cxVjypzW2	I did not do any thoughts into writing. I am using this app in place of writing right now. 
IT0FCEP8CfONigBSTa9cxVjypzW2	I have no idea what that question means.  I think it's a lack of hobbies that I was speaking about.  Just a lack of free time a lack of time to do something that I want ever.  Kind of my life oscillates between all the habitues and crashing and there's no real nurturing time doing something that I wanted to I wouldn't even know honestly what that would be at this point. 
IT0FCEP8CfONigBSTa9cxVjypzW2	I felt powerless before because I  I was felt like I was working through the you know this.  stages of grief and really exploring  so much trauma and pain and hurt but there was this constant having us there that I  couldn't figure out what it was. I couldn't put my finger on it. So if I couldn't figure out what it was I couldn't deal with it.  And the app data link on the homepage today really helped me figure that out. So now I feel  very capable of learning new ways to deal with that when it comes up. 
IT0FCEP8CfONigBSTa9cxVjypzW2	I have no idea. I guess I'm scared that I'm going to forget about them.  Or another week is going to pass by and none of them are going to get accomplished and that scares me. 
IT0FCEP8CfONigBSTa9cxVjypzW2	No, no, I don't want the loneliness to faster. I feel like I acknowledged it today. I want to acknowledge it whenever the feeling comes and deal with it in the moment and honor it, you know, but explore it but not let it just set in like  a storm that won't pass. I'm not interested in that I want to deal with it and and process it in a healthful way. 
IT0FCEP8CfONigBSTa9cxVjypzW2	I'm afraid that I'm going to forget to tackle the necessary things that need.  to be completed 
IT0FCEP8CfONigBSTa9cxVjypzW2	because I'm feeling quite depressed and  despairing frustrated very very tired  and it's very dark and gloomy and quiet here and I feel  kind of glue to my bad. I want to go back to sleep.  I want to  Ignore all of my responsibilities today take the opportunity to veg out.  But I don't know that I've ever gotten that two days in a row and so at the same time gives me anxiety because the kids aren't here again today.  and I feel like  I don't know. It's a  scary idea that just think about just  Not doing anything and relaxing in a second day. 
IT0FCEP8CfONigBSTa9cxVjypzW2	This week. I'm really looking forward to getting you know accomplishing on my workout.  I'm within the next seven days. I'm meeting with my doctor, and I'm so helpful.  That she's going to help me rebuild in the areas that I don't have the knowledge or expertise to rebuild on my own specific diet recommendations Pacific.  Supplementation and things like that to really turn this around. I am so excited.  I've kind of been.  made a new commitment to myself  the end of December  and started exercising in- you know if I have a flare day, which I think  so far in 8 weeks.  I'm pretty sure I've only had four or five which is tremendous for me.  And then I had five days where I had like the worst strep throat ever and I worked out like on the first and then I  You know couldn't do it. So I think Beyond those nine days and almost eight weeks that's such a victory for me. And so I've been able to implement the physical and just trying to work on this sleeve It's Not Great by any means, but I think it's for the most part better.  And then I'll have these other pieces to really add to it. So I'm not excited. 
IT0FCEP8CfONigBSTa9cxVjypzW2	I am leaning into the pain and allowing myself to feel it and hopefully process it. I'm sure I've made countless mistakes along the way and I think one of them that is a possible concern is that  maybe I've stayed too long and areas are maybe I'm doing something too.  Negatively affect or influence my own healing in some kind of not deliberately that along some subconscious self sabotaging kind of way.  And so keeping the help.  Up seems to keep my mood elevated which then and terms brings my physical health up.  And I keep moving forward. So that's really important because I feel like with help I can't get stuck no matter how hard it is. Sometimes to look at things and process them. It's  Really difficult, but with the hope, it feels possible. 
IT0FCEP8CfONigBSTa9cxVjypzW2	New thought I don't know that I had new thoughts. I think I kept.  Replaying aspects of old thoughts which is concerning for me.  I think I lack the ability to go through this process and allow myself to just go through it without constantly judging second-guessing and analyzing the process.  I'm very envious of people who don't care and who just let their grief.  Just come out without any shame without any.  Preconceived notions of what you sound like what it should look like.  And are content with just the expression.  It seems like I've had nothing but a series of traumas for the last.  few years to say the least and  the reactions that I've gotten  from others  Kind of haunt me.  And frustrate me and anger me and have negatively impacted the process. I think I'm frustrated by the fact that  if I let it out.  I seem to get these really wide-eyed shocked.  reactions that are gasps  And instead of them really owning their inability to hear or sit with someone else in their pain or just have the patience to give space for it and let it flow. I'm always met with criticism judgment some kind of comment.  About wow, you need counseling and just the tone is one that's not of an encouragement. Like will you seemed you know, I guess not what I need to hear not the tone of voice. I don't need you shaming me into counseling because my grief process bothers you or my pain is a problem for you and I say always laughing like his not that many people ask honestly it's just, you know few handfuls of times in the past few years that anyone's even shown the interest to know that I've gotten a healthy dose of judgement criticism. Obviously, you know, very par for the course from my mother.  So yeah, that's what the fox today. 
IT0FCEP8CfONigBSTa9cxVjypzW2	Just successfully getting through.  the grieving process after  a very painful divorce and a 13-year abusive marriage.  Wanted to watch the manipulation and lies and deception and verbal and emotional abuse.  continue  So I just want to really heal from those personal trauma and just only grieve what happened to me, but what?  All the dreams that I lost. 
IT0FCEP8CfONigBSTa9cxVjypzW2	I guess just resting continuing to rest catch up on my to-do list exercise if I can force myself out of the bed. 
IT0FCEP8CfONigBSTa9cxVjypzW2	It is that.  well, I think  I processed you know, the natural grief that comes along and the probably, you know, additional little nuances and being solely financially dependent upon him and  The ongoing kind of tie until last February to this hope and prayer that.  He and the marriage and myself will be fully restored and is not even restored like totally renewed and if for no other person purpose might my kids.  benefit  and now, you know when he found out yet about it yet another girlfriend and more lies and more deception a more addiction or abuse more frustration.  When I walked away.  I really emotionally walked away in January last January, but I physically walked away in February very beginning of February and I think it took a week or two of grieving that  really really grieving it and realizing how  under the spell I still was.  Did this help in something that?  Is nowhere near reality.  And when I was really felt delivered from that.  I think that was the beginning of even being able to address confront acknowledge the abuse and that's really been on unfolding. I didn't really start really grieving it until this fall.  And really looking with clear eyes at what had gone on and how it got went on for that long. What has to be there in a person's life for that kind of thing to carry on what's got to be going on. That's not a marriage is never just between two people. So there had to be a whole lot of enabler surround and dealing with that grief and it's just been a very tumultuous complicated layered process.  one that I'm  I'm thankful to be going through in one Eric cuz I don't want to carry that around when I say I want to be healed and restored. I want it with everything I've got.  is it on the other side it it's  unbearable  those moments in the end the lingering days whenever something's triggered or whenever it's time to deal with something. We're to look really hard at something.  It's excruciating and so nobody likes excruciating thing. So it's this bittersweet it's necessary and it's good, but it's hard and  you know, it's not a pleasurable experience. 
IT0FCEP8CfONigBSTa9cxVjypzW2	most of the day I spent kind of  I'm Reeling I think from the intense waves of grief that I had felt.  the night before Sunday night  Probably was really.  Just weeping uncontrollably until about 2 in the morning couldn't go to sleep.  which then I had didn't have great slate didn't sleep much which is about four days of that and then  spent a lot of of today in series of  triggers and waves of emotion and confusion and frustration  from seemingly repeating  the grieving process or  working through trauma just  as a result of  what I would consider in the scheme of things like meaningless triggers from comments and conversations that happened throughout the day Sunday that I didn't think much about in the moment.  And then to have it kind of bulldoze me is frustrating that I don't feel like I have a say in it that I don't feel like I have control.  Maybe the loss of control is the only time.  But it would happen because otherwise I would probably keep just moving forward in our going about the business of the day.  I wonder am I ever going to come to the end of the pain? Is there ever going to be a break?  I was watching several documentaries today to try to get my mind off my own pain and came across this show called the pharmacist.  Where this man started video recording just all of his grief is daily affairs.  I'm so pretty at the pretty much at the beginning maybe episode 2 at this point.  But it's like a an audio diary and while I can't at this point.  Go back to journaling extensively. Like I did all through my twenties and  most of my thirties feel like I write so much for school. That just doesn't have an appeal to me right now the idea of voice recording really did.  So anyway, long story short your question was do I feel stuck in a routine? I think I my routine is  Kind of overwhelming responsibility and busyness.  Five six days a week and then I crash and when I crash it's usually when the kids are with Daryl.  Which has been really hit-or-miss since October.  So I think this full 24 hours at this point now have  being alone kind of the floodgates open.  And I think the overwhelming.  nature of the grief really frustrates me in the fact that I don't  I'm not talking to anybody. I just talked to the Lord about everything which I kind of still feel like this is what I'm doing. I'm just recording it.  But there's really no.  measurement for me or feedback  to let me know that okay, this is normal and  This can be expected when you're coming out of.  An abusive marriage two and a half years since the divorce.  I guess just really wanting to know that. I'm not stats.  Is seems to be common thread my routine at this point. 
IT0FCEP8CfONigBSTa9cxVjypzW2	No, I got nothing done when these intense waves, I sleep play watch eat.  I don't know that I even allowed myself mentally to go to the place of goal setting or tasks setting for the day because I knew.  Kind of instinctually that that wasn't going to be possible and then I needed to just kind of rest in this place and meditate, you know over the thoughts and the pain hoping I think that if I leaned into it, I would come to the other side of it quicker.  And that it wouldn't carry over into the next day. 
IT0FCEP8CfONigBSTa9cxVjypzW2	Nearly my entire to do list.  all the emailing and texting and scanning and planning and looking over lessons and mapping out homework and  A million things I worked out. I went to the grocery store at a really good day. 
IT0FCEP8CfONigBSTa9cxVjypzW2	I woke up this morning. I  have time and space for myself.  And so I'm grateful for that. 
IT0FCEP8CfONigBSTa9cxVjypzW2	Oh, yeah been missing rest. I've been missing.  Relaxation. I've been missing Hobbies. I've been missing friends.  I've been missing.  the work of the color  it ended two and a half years ago when when my divorce happened and  I guess I just really haven't ever stopped missing it even though I literally never talk about it. I don't think I've ever.  been involved in a work that  so tapped into  my desire to build community and help others and teach and administrate and lead and it kind of pushed all the buttons for me.  and then  Fred to be kind of ripped away how and when it was.  It's weird I go about my day and I don't think about it.  But then whenever a trigger comes along and triggers it.  I realize will it must have always been there just so deep that I don't have access to the feelings. And so typically when a trigger happens and I'm reminded it's extremely painful. It's overwhelming. I'm frustrated by it cuz I want to know why is it still there? Why am I still grieving this loss?  And if I'm craving this loss, how can I be sometimes weeks and months at a time without even thinking about it and then something happens and it's like it was yesterday. I'm frustrated by it. 
IT0FCEP8CfONigBSTa9cxVjypzW2	Thinking about all of the different things that I need to do that are kind of pressing that at the same time. I'm putting off because I just want to rest 
IT0FCEP8CfONigBSTa9cxVjypzW2	I have no idea. These questions are really making me see what a place of Despair I'm in.  I can't think of anything. Joyful inspiring uplifting.  I think I might need some help. 
IT0FCEP8CfONigBSTa9cxVjypzW2	That I'm really interested in healing and moving forward. 
IT0FCEP8CfONigBSTa9cxVjypzW2	is accomplishing all of the  I had to do with items that I haven't been able to get to because really homework exercise cooking cleaning chauffeuring the kids to all of their things and homeschooling.  Please like less than you know, I'm less than the time. I need to get through the day. So I really made a lot of progress on that today less. 
IT0FCEP8CfONigBSTa9cxVjypzW2	Well yesterday I didn't get out of the bed and all I did was kind of meditate on.  trauma and pain and  the frustration of it  and in leaning into it.  It took everything out of me. So I just  gave the damn way over to it. And so I'm hoping that  it doesn't take another day and I can free myself of these.  Like this Merry-Go-Round of painful memories. 
IT0FCEP8CfONigBSTa9cxVjypzW2	I had a really productive day. I think after I  recorded some thoughts and prayers this morning.  I'm really had that breakthrough about.  Loneliness though. There is a  A link on the homepage for this app and it led me to a lot of articles on loneliness and what loneliness can do.  to your physical and emotional health  and that kind of hit me like a ton of bricks cuz I think I've been just allowing this.  You know for lack of a better metaphor, but like it's a genuine feeling that I think should be acknowledged but it's like what started out as like a couple small weeds and that I just kind of ignored cuz I really was feeling lonely. It's like this massive crop of weeds.  And I wasn't like nursing them. I was at nursing a feeling of loneliness. It just steadily grew over time, and I was completely unconscious.  The weight that it was putting on me.  So after I like meditate on that and really prayed about it and talk to the Lord about it. I just felt really really good. Looks like a total shift in my mind like, okay, well that, you know, just determining that that emotion isn't going to control me anymore. So I made out of all of a sudden burst of energy. I didn't have to force myself like 20 things on the to-do list got almost all of them accomplished.  Worked out for probably two hours that my step goal did to MPC workout went to the grocery store talk to the kiddos.  Did a little bit of homework?  Also have like rest time and watched a really good documentary.  The happiness Expedition I'll just had a really good restful productive day. 
IT0FCEP8CfONigBSTa9cxVjypzW2	I'm grateful for these guided.  Questions. I'm grateful for the discovery that I made today. I'm grateful that I  so powerful that I feel capable of dealing with this feeling that there are actually things I can do to combat it.  mentally emotionally socially  And that I'm not really under its control. 
IT0FCEP8CfONigBSTa9cxVjypzW2	no, I  I quit reaching out.  Two and a half years ago. It seems to be  a recurring theme now that I'm talking about it.  It's almost as if  my life stopped  a lot of ways  and the more painful and the more difficult  Dealing with the Fallout became.  the more I retreated and isolated because  I can't imagine sharing those things.  With anyone else. I can't imagine talking.  completely freely and openly  when anytime I have before there's kind of been such a backlash.  a criticism and judgment and  which then makes me feel ashamed and then I isolate more so it's kind of like a spiral.  I need I need I need to do this though.  I don't really have anyone. 
IT0FCEP8CfONigBSTa9cxVjypzW2	I deserve to be comfortable in my own skin. 
IT0FCEP8CfONigBSTa9cxVjypzW2	different way I was really focused on the end goal processing the grief and the trauma  just the idea of it was really difficult because I you know, like to say that I was a world-class stuff for you will never meet a better stiffer than I I just now have every Accolade every accomplishment and credential where that's concerned. So  Just I think at the threshold agreeing that and submitting to the Lord that I wasn't going to do that anymore fully cognizant. He's not going to allow me to do that anymore. I have to process this. I have to walk through it.  That was a lot.  And then there's probably like that newness thing like it was exhilarating to let things out and talk about until I was blue in the face and feel them.  And learned to lean into emotions and learn to lean into the pain and sit with patients and give space for feelings at all of these things. But when it's going on two and a half years, it isn't fun anymore. I'll just be honest. It's not exciting. It's  Frustrating because never in a million years if you would have asked, you know, if the Lord would have told me at the beginning all well. You'll still be doing this x amount of days later x amount of months later. I would have turned and ran so I think persevering.  And just being determined to see through to the end whatever that is. I mean, I don't know that quote on quote end is  Realistic, there's probably always going to be things to grieve in life. But I think just feeling like I have fully  I've walked through all of the processes all the steps and terms of the divorce. Actually. I think the divorce is largely over.  I'm saying that right now I am.  And actually I think that was over a while ago. I think the grief process for that.  concluded I think what I'm grieving now is  all the abuse that I encountered and how much of it is steel on going despite having divorced him.  That's probably what's going on now. 
IT0FCEP8CfONigBSTa9cxVjypzW2	I think it's more like this elephant in the room in that.  two and a half years  since I've been divorced  I spend a lot of time.  in my room  not alone with my children.  and  I had many days.  In the first probably 6 months.  where are just  Hang out in my bed all day.  And that's been a while ago, but there's been so many negative comments about it.  To wear now if I really just want to give into it.  I feel like I can't. 
IT0FCEP8CfONigBSTa9cxVjypzW2	It's not an accident that those are usually also.  My down days emotionally seems like when you have a chronic illness.  And one that can be as debilitating as mine is when they are flares.  It affects everything and the fact that it's been prolonged and it's like one more tremendous hardship at a time when every single thing, you know everyday is really hard.  So I get really discouraged I fall into you know into these pits of despair.  I'm so I think.  Trying to do everything to keep my physical health improving and moving upward and onward is really important.  Peanut to My overall health cuz I think four years as a staffer. I really believed that.  by not dealing with  pain or grieving things in the moment.  that  I was preventing it's a fact I think.  And not really realizing it was all being stored up in my nervous system. It would like my body was keeping score.  and  I just had no idea.  I thought you know, I'm a really positive. I had been really active and there were all kinds of things going on in my life and I didn't feel depressed. I didn't feel lonely. I didn't ask known as long as I didn't feel it and I certainly wasn't thinking about it. Then it must not be there but it's like  depth at the Hertz and  The rejection then neglect the verbal abuse the emotional abuse the financial abuse. All of it was just stacking up stacking up stacking up and so  it's like I'm paying again.  Like I'm experiencing it all over again because it's like payday has come or my body is concerned.  And that's very very devastating. And so I want to keep doing everything to support my body during this time to get to the other side. 
IT0FCEP8CfONigBSTa9cxVjypzW2	I don't know why people feel that way. I think I feel ready to deal with feelings of loneliness and helplessness.  I want to exchange that for  Being a powerful person and being a person under self control and that I can safely explore an emotion without you know, being swallowed up by it. 
IT0FCEP8CfONigBSTa9cxVjypzW2	I don't say.  Really anything up uplifting?  and I think it's now I'm  beginning to wonder if it's my refusal to say.  If the despair is so heavy.  that there's actually joy and  community and  peace and  all sorts of things available  But I can't seem to reach them.  Instead of I've been truly believe in the past couple years that there just isn't any available in this season and that I need to accept it. 
IT0FCEP8CfONigBSTa9cxVjypzW2	I don't even know what that question is.  I don't need to avoid time and space. I need to embrace it.  strange I  spend so many days moving at the speed of light.  But all I want is a few days to just  Breast and check out and gather myself together. That's all I think about that I want and now that I have it I have this overwhelming like  Sense of hurry up. Hurry up, you know get things done. Stop avoiding your to-do list, you know, you need to do your homework just this kind of drill sergeant in my mind that all the very real and very important things that I need to do.  But I don't know when I'm going to get this opportunity again.  Some kind of wrestling with myself right now. 
IT0FCEP8CfONigBSTa9cxVjypzW2	I think the most memorable part was the white that I felt left off of me once I realized what's been plaguing me. I've been doing so much work, you know in terms of healing so much reading and processing and researching in talking out and meditating and praying and so many things and still feeling this having us that I didn't really know where it was coming from and as soon as I realized that it was  the perceived and real loneliness that I've been experiencing has been.  really sabotaging me I felt  Powerful in that I could do something about it once I realized what it was. 
IT0FCEP8CfONigBSTa9cxVjypzW2	I never thought about being a good friend to myself.  Just letting myself enjoy the peace and quiet.  And take care of the things that I I need to or feel.  glad to take care of and just  the kids will be back in the morning in the steam train will roll over me again.  That it's okay to have another day of rest. It's okay, no matter what anyone else thinks so probably just resting relaxing.  I'm not beating myself up about it. 
IT0FCEP8CfONigBSTa9cxVjypzW2	Some of these sentences are equestrians are bizarre. How long does it take to cope with one goal that doesn't even make any sense.  Originally, my goal was to be on the other side of the grief.  And I would be lying if I steal.  Don't on some level desire that but I think now I'm the goal has been readjusted to also living and thriving and moving forward in other areas in spite of it. 
IT0FCEP8CfONigBSTa9cxVjypzW2	I'm feeling hopeful about my emotional and mental health.  that these  ongoing  burdensome  stages are phases will eventually  come to a close.  It just feels like grief upon grief of hungry and that and that naturally takes a long time to wait through but when you're that's one thing to talk about it, it's another thing to go through that process that feels like it's literally never going to end. So I'm  Helpful, I think I realize I'm really heavy burden for one of loneliness and just recognizing that and then coming up with really actionable.  steps and ideas to counteract that 
IT0FCEP8CfONigBSTa9cxVjypzW2	I think I got this voice recording app.  To be more like a a journal of my thoughts that I don't have to write.  And I thought okay well.  The fact that I'm being prompted to answer particular questions at first, I thought well that might be helpful actually.  and now I'm thinking it's making me feel very depressed because the only  Conversation that I have in a day is with things to have.  the only person that a knowledge is  or asks me if I'm okay is  an artificial intelligence  Linda Ramey  and not a real person.  Gianna Des I know that she  genuinely cares about me, but I think she's at 
IT0FCEP8CfONigBSTa9cxVjypzW2	I don't know.  I don't know.  I think what's my health?  Is restored I can see myself getting up early.  and incorporating  outdoor runs and possibly going to the GM.  I'm building in some time for myself before everyone gets that because otherwise  on most days I can't see it happening.  I'm also looking forward to  the prospect of having a more balanced and steady stream of energy instead of  Kind of having it.  A certain number of days and I'm Max it out is probably the problem with all the things being a single mom with four kids.  And all the activities and service and volunteering and carpooling and driving and show frame and teaching them and also do my own homework.  Then I crash I'm so I would love to find a way to balance all of that to some degree.

IUc86GdBsxdnDnreLYM6IFDiGen2	Too much on my brain. Procrastination and not having enough time to do things. 
IUc86GdBsxdnDnreLYM6IFDiGen2	I have lack of trust with my husband and vice versa. It’s constant back and forth. He finds something negative every time. He says I do the same but it could be because I have a simple question and he goes on defense. This causes my emotions to escalate and my brain shuts down and caused me to not want to do anything and go into this deep hole. Feeling anxious and feeling crazy. 
IUc86GdBsxdnDnreLYM6IFDiGen2	I am experiencing overwhelming thoughts.  of  trying to balance life altogether. I just been crying.  I'm trying to figure out.  Which direction to go with in my life?

IYnhwjTyYHa4TI6Q4eVDmFru2D82	I hate the word resolution because I feel like it.  doesn't  adequately describe it mean resolution for stalled. I'm resolved to do the following.  Set screw.  Okay, so I'm the question I am resolved.  2  first of all, I do for intermittent fasting where I'm not eating anything in the morning, of course that they say for drinking a Starbucks drink, but I really feel like healthier. I feel healthier when I don't eat until lunch.  Inflammation in my brain lyric as well. I'm resolved to get better sleep.  So no caffeine after a certain time in the day.  I'm resolved to enjoy my life.  And not be anxious or not be not a boy that they things that in the past.  Have really caused me anxiety. So I think for example of being around the kids has been something that I've tried to avoid it during the day and I don't want to do that just kids they're not.  it's that mean there's something I have control over sometimes but they're also Joy so I am resolved to  look at them as  find little people to be right now and not be thinking about ways that I can go do my own thing or get away from that and I resolved to be around my family for  I am resolved to  be happy with my life and not try to fit myself into any sort of other box that Christian women think that I should be him. And for the world that I should be happy, but  I  I have a drive to have project and things going on in my life.  That gives me joy, and I feel bad about that.  I want to not neglect God. I'm resolved not neglect God I'm resolved not neglect my relationship with the Lord but also realize that work within the framework of me also doing things that I enjoy and I enjoy having businesses and I enjoyed your like that and so I resolved to find a way to make that work within.  My family likes to do my family likes first after God but not feeling sad about wanting to other things besides cooking and cleaning and doing laundry. The things that that was the biggest Catalyst for anxiety for me after the new year after I finish editing images. I had nothing.  I had no projects. I  was trying to be happy with just not jumping something wrong with that.  Isn't it okay for me to also do other things that give me joy and it's like my hobby it is my hobby. And that's okay. It's okay. I'm not going to ask about it.  Cuz I think that's what gave me a sense of.  Now what the rest of my life release my kids are gone. I'm going to have to get a new identity of check-in anxiety last year. I resolve to not let myself.  Get there resolved identify. What's okay.  Do you want to work for the Lord and I can meet you better at that?  Better at encouraging other people and being involved with others.  But this year's to be so much better than last year.  Starlets of what is there on our way? Regardless if I don't know I feel in my heart maybe death.  hopefully not. But I feel there's Therapy that ever see him with mental Clarity and the right medication and support and prayer.  It will be.

IbtWHJFoH8bVtPgpew6izsKWeJV2	My heart beated faster I felt safe and I felt warm 
IbtWHJFoH8bVtPgpew6izsKWeJV2	I’d probably still be heartbroken with the fact that he doesn’t like me back 
IbtWHJFoH8bVtPgpew6izsKWeJV2	I’d probably not do it anymore Bc I realized he’s never gonna like me back
IbtWHJFoH8bVtPgpew6izsKWeJV2	I really want to get smarter and learn more in school 
IbtWHJFoH8bVtPgpew6izsKWeJV2	I’m ready to stop comparing myself to others

IbtWHJFoH8bVtPgpew6izsKWeJV2	I let me crush sleep in my arms while he slept I brushed his hair and hugged him tight while he grabbed onto my arm

would ask him out and I would love him "
IbtWHJFoH8bVtPgpew6izsKWeJV2	That I’m in love with my crush 
IbtWHJFoH8bVtPgpew6izsKWeJV2	maybe being there for him more because I know he’s hurt I can just see through it 
IbtWHJFoH8bVtPgpew6izsKWeJV2	To not tell my crush anything and keep it bottled up inside me for however long I love him 
IbtWHJFoH8bVtPgpew6izsKWeJV2	just talk to someone about it and hopefully heal 
IbtWHJFoH8bVtPgpew6izsKWeJV2	I really love him and i dont know what to do 
IbtWHJFoH8bVtPgpew6izsKWeJV2	He would be disgusted of me and I would be bullied forever 
IbtWHJFoH8bVtPgpew6izsKWeJV2	To pass my finals and SBACS
IbtWHJFoH8bVtPgpew6izsKWeJV2	If I would’ve not said anything to my friends

IbtWHJFoH8bVtPgpew6izsKWeJV2	That he likes me back and asks me out 
IbtWHJFoH8bVtPgpew6izsKWeJV2	I’d probably get over it by then 
IbtWHJFoH8bVtPgpew6izsKWeJV2	Telling this one dude I like him
IbtWHJFoH8bVtPgpew6izsKWeJV2	Our friendship would be ruined 
IbtWHJFoH8bVtPgpew6izsKWeJV2	adorable, gorgeous, funny

IbtWHJFoH8bVtPgpew6izsKWeJV2	Me feeling loved and having a partner there for me
IbtWHJFoH8bVtPgpew6izsKWeJV2	If I pass I can get into good classes and be in a loving community

IbtWHJFoH8bVtPgpew6izsKWeJV2	I would go to Bali and just let him sleep in my arms and brush his hair 
IbtWHJFoH8bVtPgpew6izsKWeJV2	We’re not exactly together I just really like him and I want to talk about him and he’s funny 
IbtWHJFoH8bVtPgpew6izsKWeJV2	I might never be able to talk to him again

Imd7BnivIRUSwO7J4FsesUjMGaV2	I went to class and had lunch with my friend 
IpgfPUJOM7NcDOvK0RQyhMvTmrm2	I felt ungrateful. Like I felt like they thought I was over grateful. 
IpgfPUJOM7NcDOvK0RQyhMvTmrm2	To at least try to forgive about it not forgive her cuz I will never ever forgive her for what she was mean about.  Ultra. Forget about it and get up the restroom go back downstairs and just act like everything was normal. 
IpgfPUJOM7NcDOvK0RQyhMvTmrm2	Then I think we would all be grateful because we would basically have everything free. 
IpgfPUJOM7NcDOvK0RQyhMvTmrm2	What was something you did today to take care of yourself? I took a nap and really helped out. 
IpgfPUJOM7NcDOvK0RQyhMvTmrm2	Be fat and eat a lot of chocolate and then take my family out to eat.  And then watch a movie after that. 
IpgfPUJOM7NcDOvK0RQyhMvTmrm2	Well, I honestly don't know what that means. But all I know is that when I was first in pre-K.  I didn't know any words at all.  Until I started hearing the more often. I started learning them. 
IpgfPUJOM7NcDOvK0RQyhMvTmrm2	Yes, my grandma being disrespectful disrespectful and won't turn to be nice.  At least appreciate what I've done for her. 
IpgfPUJOM7NcDOvK0RQyhMvTmrm2	My mom because she takes care of me. 
IpgfPUJOM7NcDOvK0RQyhMvTmrm2	Then that would be annoying because we would all know what we're at. What's coming next? 
IpgfPUJOM7NcDOvK0RQyhMvTmrm2	I felt like I was being treated unfairly, even though I do good things for my family.  I am crying because nobody appreciates what I do. 
IpgfPUJOM7NcDOvK0RQyhMvTmrm2	I am mad because I am being treated unfairly by my grandma and  it makes me just want to punch someone in the face. 
IpgfPUJOM7NcDOvK0RQyhMvTmrm2	Pet my grandma sometimes can be B2B. 
IpgfPUJOM7NcDOvK0RQyhMvTmrm2	I would get a panda cuz they are cute and dumb.  I will take this tattoo from a professional tattooist. 
IpgfPUJOM7NcDOvK0RQyhMvTmrm2	Well, I would be able to deal with it because I have what time I broke my phone and haven't had a phone for a year. I guess my sister. My sister was jealous cuz I got more phone sooner but like them.  I will feel bad because you need a phone to communicate with your friends and family. It's another calendar sometime. 
IpgfPUJOM7NcDOvK0RQyhMvTmrm2	Hold in my tears and I left to the bathroom to take a few breaths in and out and then started crying because I felt like nobody even wanted me here. 
IpgfPUJOM7NcDOvK0RQyhMvTmrm2	My mom she helped me and my sister forgive each other. 
IpgfPUJOM7NcDOvK0RQyhMvTmrm2	It's been not that bad but a few fights with my sister.  The best part was eating my chips and watching Jane the Virgin. 
IpgfPUJOM7NcDOvK0RQyhMvTmrm2	My mom could she help me out a lot. 
IpgfPUJOM7NcDOvK0RQyhMvTmrm2	Hitting my sister and giving up a fight for her.

IpgfPUJOM7NcDOvK0RQyhMvTmrm2	Yes, cuz I took a long nap and it was really good because my mind it got to have some rest. 
IpgfPUJOM7NcDOvK0RQyhMvTmrm2	Can you get money orders?  Hello, how you doing? Girl stuff my sister. I'm sorry. I don't have any relationships with people but 
IsI5KFr68jcL3C4M1IQTvm62eKQ2	Since last year around this time. 
IsI5KFr68jcL3C4M1IQTvm62eKQ2	I talked to my girlfriend and she made me feel better about everything like she always does. 
IsI5KFr68jcL3C4M1IQTvm62eKQ2	I saw my girlfriend she brought a smile to my face like every other day. 
IsI5KFr68jcL3C4M1IQTvm62eKQ2	It wasn't cold and Droopy. It was just a little chilly and overall not bad weather. 
IsI5KFr68jcL3C4M1IQTvm62eKQ2	It's been good few ups and downs, but overall has been terrible and I'm quite enjoying it actually. 
IsI5KFr68jcL3C4M1IQTvm62eKQ2	House beautiful girl she is and you know, I want to show her that you means the world to me and I wanted to see herself like I do. 
IsI5KFr68jcL3C4M1IQTvm62eKQ2	Get there school easily and make my girlfriend feel happy again. 
IsI5KFr68jcL3C4M1IQTvm62eKQ2	Experiencing grief before today is just being able to live another day and you know, enjoy the positives whatever with everything else going on. 
IsI5KFr68jcL3C4M1IQTvm62eKQ2	Give me more compliments to my girlfriend because she still doesn't feel that great about herself. And I wondered if it feel like you know, like I wanted to see her as I see her but you know, like good more, you know acts of kindness with her. 
IsI5KFr68jcL3C4M1IQTvm62eKQ2	Yeah, mostly. I believe I spend most of my day use doing stuff that is actually useful.

J0PQqNncIaexDnAtq3HIq6MWwJh1	I'm not sure what the question is asking. 
J0PQqNncIaexDnAtq3HIq6MWwJh1	I had a dream that I was in my parents old apartment.  And I was trying to escape but while I was trying to escape I was also trying to save everyone around me which included my family. So we were basically trapped and my childhood apartment. 
J0PQqNncIaexDnAtq3HIq6MWwJh1	I want to just keep to myself distance myself from everybody focus on school work and my relationship with my fiance. 
J0PQqNncIaexDnAtq3HIq6MWwJh1	I don't think so. But I always have dreams like this for I'm trapped in my old childhood apartment, and I'm trying to escape or something is trying to come in and get me. 
J0PQqNncIaexDnAtq3HIq6MWwJh1	Because I don't understand why I am the one. They want to make an effort or why.  I'm there telling me to make such a big effort to reach out to them when they don't even reach out to me. Plus I have school and work but I'm focused on right now. So I don't understand why they  Basically want me to kiss their ass? 
J0PQqNncIaexDnAtq3HIq6MWwJh1	That's pretty much. Thank you. 
J0PQqNncIaexDnAtq3HIq6MWwJh1	No, not really in the mood itself is dark I guess. 
J0PQqNncIaexDnAtq3HIq6MWwJh1	very confused angry and pissed pissed off in general 
J0PQqNncIaexDnAtq3HIq6MWwJh1	I guess that in some way they care, but I just don't want to show that they care. 
J0PQqNncIaexDnAtq3HIq6MWwJh1	Yes, I have this dream almost every night of my old childhood apartment. 
J0PQqNncIaexDnAtq3HIq6MWwJh1	I'm stressed out because I have other important things to focus on then mending relationships with people who could care less about me or not showed an interest in the past. 
J0PQqNncIaexDnAtq3HIq6MWwJh1	No, because in my dreams of my old apartment, I don't remember ever escaping. I just remember always being trapped. 
J0PQqNncIaexDnAtq3HIq6MWwJh1	Are the things that were dropping us in the apartment? They weren't really human.  Which made it kind of scary and everyone I was trying to protect seemed voluble. 
J0PQqNncIaexDnAtq3HIq6MWwJh1	Oh, I just want to stop talking to everybody and just focus on myself because I don't have time for the drama. 
J0PQqNncIaexDnAtq3HIq6MWwJh1	So lately I'm going to my family has been reaching out to me to reach out to them or I don't really have the best relationship with anybody in my family that's always been a dysfunctional situation.  And it makes me upset because everyone expects me to reach out to them and to extend myself when I never received the same in return and I just feel like they're just expecting too much from me when I'm like the youngest person in my family and they're all like older adults.  I don't understand why a lot of pressure is put on me to reach out to everyone when they could care less about me. 
J1uQzqpyd8WMJfWlYaoG7WndD7j1	I needed a better way to manage my mental health. 
J3eWnIN4PYXOoajRzYBItnfSALq2	I think I can learn online.

J3eWnIN4PYXOoajRzYBItnfSALq2	That theories I wouldn't put it past and I wouldn't doubt if that was the case.  If it was a case though, I wouldn't care because regardless I'm just living life to the fullest as much as you can.

Every decision you make will lose you somewhere and I just don't want to make the wrong one.  And I want to wish you all the dreams that I have no matter how crazy they are.  But I don't know if I'll ever allow myself to do that. 
J3eWnIN4PYXOoajRzYBItnfSALq2	I want to experience.  I want to experience two things. I want experience marriage and I want to experience.  what it's like speaking in front of an audience like  Public speaking like someone coming to see you speak.  I feel compelled to experience.  That one because I want to know what it's like to have that much control over that many people are rude and they just they intentionally take to hit when you had to say like it we have to say is that important?

Then I was a little stressed because I had to figure out my high school classes but I think I have it mostly figured out and I am curious to see what the guidance counselor will say. Now I am just chilling and getting ready for bed!
JaXPREJzf5Wb6z7GTNRZ82u0WQk2	I am grateful to look forward to high school and the experiences it will bring me.

JiDaoZH5tLa7MCFCdYoQEZZuA3v1	I trust myself and I know myself best. 
JiDaoZH5tLa7MCFCdYoQEZZuA3v1	I'm a personal personal value and I have the right to be treated as such. 
JiDaoZH5tLa7MCFCdYoQEZZuA3v1	relationship with my mom and my sisters and my  one of my two of my best friend's what three my best friend. 
JiDaoZH5tLa7MCFCdYoQEZZuA3v1	expressing myself more  coming out to my mother and my family.  Standing up before people.  defending myself more  not being insecure and not being intimidated.  Gorilla, and really meeting meeting meaning what I say. 
JiDaoZH5tLa7MCFCdYoQEZZuA3v1	Thank you, Jesus.  Thank you. 
JjYVrnHp55U1jNX5jKAEL3nblF42	I don't know I guess.  maybe I am  do it intentionally to  provocative  I don't know to see if he'll how upset. He'll get it made Isis. It's not a good thing. 
JjYVrnHp55U1jNX5jKAEL3nblF42	Well, it's been tough. And I guess this was yesterday. Really I  given to some Temptation and  that made it difficult cuz you know, I really want to honor God and  sometimes it just never seems to  Go away, so I'd really like to be disciplined and live a life of Love towards Jesus. 
JjYVrnHp55U1jNX5jKAEL3nblF42	I would say I'm pretty relaxed easy-going.  Sometimes it takes me awhile to cross folks. But you know, yeah, I'm pretty relaxed pretty easy to get along with and open. 
JjYVrnHp55U1jNX5jKAEL3nblF42	I would say hopefully moving to San Diego to be close to my daughters and becoming a chaplain in the military. 
JjYVrnHp55U1jNX5jKAEL3nblF42	Are engaged to Ashley today has nothing to do with me. I'm so fly play basketball. It was help with people had lunch with folks has nothing to do with being social has to do with dealing with a true emotional part of what's going on. 
JjYVrnHp55U1jNX5jKAEL3nblF42	Yeah a good woman who will take me as I am. 
JjYVrnHp55U1jNX5jKAEL3nblF42	Probably that. I just need someone to talk to or too.  Be able to journal this way. 
JjYVrnHp55U1jNX5jKAEL3nblF42	Easy because you know when I make bad choices, for example, if a woman rejects me and I go seek approval from another woman. How is that Godly? How am I doing the right thing? How do I have the confidence in myself to say? Yeah, that's okay. Maybe this one doesn't like you needed somebody with. 
JjYVrnHp55U1jNX5jKAEL3nblF42	Of course. I know who having somebody who  probably identifies with me and can understand what's going on. That's where I feel most safe. 
JjYVrnHp55U1jNX5jKAEL3nblF42	I think that's kind of stupid honestly to say that we've always had a friend in our self the problem is I don't really like myself. So how am I supposed to think that I'm a great friend? 
JjYVrnHp55U1jNX5jKAEL3nblF42	Well, I want to be a present dad to my daughters and being close to them as what's important to me and then being a chaplain is what I'm called to do. It's part of who I am to use the gifts. God has given me. 
JjYVrnHp55U1jNX5jKAEL3nblF42	I think I mostly feel rejected. And when I feel rejected, it leads to loneliness and then I feel like I need to seek out the approval of other women and I don't understand why I do that. 
JjYVrnHp55U1jNX5jKAEL3nblF42	I have a variety of topics. I guess it would just depend on.  Who I'm talking to?  What's going on in my life at the time and stuff like that? 
Jpdujxe1YYh2gWSRcFmLeB3W8uk2	His name is Edgar. But how many years old is last time? I was about 17 18. It's been about  it's been 3 years. 
Jpdujxe1YYh2gWSRcFmLeB3W8uk2	I'm really good. How are you? 
Jpdujxe1YYh2gWSRcFmLeB3W8uk2	I don't understand your question. 
Jpdujxe1YYh2gWSRcFmLeB3W8uk2	Yes, I don't really like.  This question cuz I don't want to say I am intelligent but I've been told that I am smart. 
Jpdujxe1YYh2gWSRcFmLeB3W8uk2	Stop caring about what people think about me. 
Jpdujxe1YYh2gWSRcFmLeB3W8uk2	I'm not sure what the meaning was. It just kind of brought out motion. I guess maybe then I still have feelings for him and that I still kind of think about him from time to time. 
Jpdujxe1YYh2gWSRcFmLeB3W8uk2	What would I say about my face if it was cute, I would be happy. 
Jpdujxe1YYh2gWSRcFmLeB3W8uk2	I would just start off by just being like hey, what's up? My name is Susie. 
Jpdujxe1YYh2gWSRcFmLeB3W8uk2	It's going bad.  I feel like shit.  I literally stepped on crap. I was walking.  Okay. Well, I just got off work.  And since I don't have a car I have to walk to my house because I don't have any money.  so  I don't feel so good. 
Jpdujxe1YYh2gWSRcFmLeB3W8uk2	I don't really feel like people notice me.  When I just go on with my days, I don't really feel like I get much attention. I feel like I'm perceived like a normal background character at work. I feel like people think I'm just weird.  My family again. I think they think I'm a little weird, but they love me regardless. 
Jpdujxe1YYh2gWSRcFmLeB3W8uk2	I know it's already night time. 
Jpdujxe1YYh2gWSRcFmLeB3W8uk2	I haven't hanged out with anyone new.  Haven't done a bunch of stay home. 
Jpdujxe1YYh2gWSRcFmLeB3W8uk2	the fact that  I had been a long time since I've seen him.  Touching his face and still having feelings for him. 
Jpdujxe1YYh2gWSRcFmLeB3W8uk2	That's a good question. There's not really anything. I'm super looking forward to if I'm being honest. I don't have any plans for this year. 
Jpdujxe1YYh2gWSRcFmLeB3W8uk2	I had a friend her name is Miriam. I think I made a positive difference in her life, whether she believes it or not because I kind of showed her how to be less awkward.  I showed her how to be more accepting of herself.  Of her weirdness and understand that she can be someone she can be a good person and a good friend and that she's just simply had the wrong people around her. 
Jpdujxe1YYh2gWSRcFmLeB3W8uk2	Yes, I know.  No, because I don't really have enough successes.  And that's pretty much it. 
Jpdujxe1YYh2gWSRcFmLeB3W8uk2	I guess that I'm scared of using this job because I know it's an AI kind of thing.  But at the same time I've been sharing so many of my thoughts on Instagram that I guess I shouldn't really be much of a big difference using this and if it can just help me to just be a better person. That would be really cool cuz I don't really have a lot of friends at the moment.  Or and spend a while. So  I just want to know that I'm actually using something for my betterment and actually like be able to help other people not make others feel like I'm using them but actually take the time to do something for myself. 
Jpdujxe1YYh2gWSRcFmLeB3W8uk2	I remember.  Waking up and just being like what the heck? Why did I dream about this? Cuz it's been like 4 years since I've last seen him but I remember how hot my hand felt touching him. And remember I remember feeling kind of like butterflies or like my stomach was  like a little Weezy 
Jpdujxe1YYh2gWSRcFmLeB3W8uk2	I don't think I do.  I don't push myself hard enough. 
Jpdujxe1YYh2gWSRcFmLeB3W8uk2	No, I think I can be nicer, but I kind of afraid of being too nice.  Cuz nice means foolish. 
Jpdujxe1YYh2gWSRcFmLeB3W8uk2	I think I socialize.  Two little but I think I'm kind of okay with it.  And the reason I say that is because I don't have a lot of friends. I  Yeah, like all day. I haven't texted anybody haven't called anyone on the phone. I'm sorry. I don't really talk to people that much. 
Jpdujxe1YYh2gWSRcFmLeB3W8uk2	Keep my room clean.  pain on top of my errands  have a morning and night routine.  And manage my finances better. 
Jpdujxe1YYh2gWSRcFmLeB3W8uk2	It was actually easy to answer it because I am aware of my flaws and you're just asked me to pretty much name them. So it was easy. 
Jpdujxe1YYh2gWSRcFmLeB3W8uk2	I think I am lacking confidence.  because of my work  I  Was told that I wasn't that good at making pieces, so it got me a little insecure. 
Jpdujxe1YYh2gWSRcFmLeB3W8uk2	Pretty Boss TV spirituality baby. I look up 200 Justine because she  she has a spirit about her. She's like very  Down to earth spiritual but she's also very grounded and balanced and understands.  Herself understands our spirit and understands business and money and I just really look really find that inspiring that there's a person I thought that exists and hopefully I can one day for you.  You know business-minded, but I've never really been that way. 
Jpdujxe1YYh2gWSRcFmLeB3W8uk2	It may or may not be true. 
Jpdujxe1YYh2gWSRcFmLeB3W8uk2	The most important personal goal. I currently don't have one. 
Jpdujxe1YYh2gWSRcFmLeB3W8uk2	So I had this dream.  A couple nights ago. It was I drunk that I would that I saw my ex-boyfriend and that he invited him into my house.  And my mom started talking about all the different guy as I've gone out with since then and I got a little bit uncomfortable and then he's my ex-boyfriend turned completely ready cuz he was so embarrassed. So then I put my hand on his face and I felt how hot it was and  That was pretty much it. 
Jpdujxe1YYh2gWSRcFmLeB3W8uk2	great question  I can hear me. I'm self-conscious about my acne and self-conscious about  My face, sometimes I don't feel like I have a cute interface or like it doesn't stand out enough.  I'm self-conscious about  l'education level haven't gone to college. I only went to high school. I'm self-conscious that I still live with my mom.  I'm self-conscious that I kind of want to say that I don't have enough friends and I don't go out enough. I'm self-conscious that I crashed my car again.  Self-conscious that I still work at Domino's but okay with it.  I'm self-conscious that I procrastinate a lot and I tend to be lazy. 
Jpdujxe1YYh2gWSRcFmLeB3W8uk2	It means if you're nice, then people think you're foolish and they can take advantage of it. 
Jpdujxe1YYh2gWSRcFmLeB3W8uk2	If I had a boyfriend, I would text him.  I wanted to text my friend Steve but he's always busy. So yeah. 
Jpdujxe1YYh2gWSRcFmLeB3W8uk2	cast of Kung Fu Panda I want to be a business person because I  Want to have something of my own creation I want to do something and no one else has done and wasting my family. I want to be able to have the liberty and freedom of choosing what time I want to work.  and  is this also a kind of like an infinite amount of  Honey, you some cash out of it. There's no limits like you the only one who can limit use yourself. 
Jpdujxe1YYh2gWSRcFmLeB3W8uk2	I'm proud of myself.  Because I felt like today.  I just feel like I'm growing up and being a better version of myself every single day and I I feel like today I felt grounded without having to try to be grounded. It just happened.  I just don't feel like  Like I was in and out of reality, so I just felt like I was here and it felt really good. I did just felt normal. 
Jpdujxe1YYh2gWSRcFmLeB3W8uk2	Nothing about it scares me cuz I have jade plant.  Yeah.

K6Q7pMg71TQFlIQR1XuezXRhlHz2	My husbands love and his ears for him to not always put his feelings over mine
K6Q7pMg71TQFlIQR1XuezXRhlHz2	Rejection sucks but it allows you to learn but always be willing to listen to others as well as know yourself
K6Q7pMg71TQFlIQR1XuezXRhlHz2	Any rejection can teach you because everyone has their own way of thinking
K6Q7pMg71TQFlIQR1XuezXRhlHz2	I don’t I want to be unique 
K6Q7pMg71TQFlIQR1XuezXRhlHz2	There's not really anything to change.  Because my surroundings are already. Well put together is just keeping up on the little things such as dishes and garbage.  vacuuming in laundry 
K6Q7pMg71TQFlIQR1XuezXRhlHz2	No phone until I get stuff done. 
K6Q7pMg71TQFlIQR1XuezXRhlHz2	I know myself so I trust myself

K6Q7pMg71TQFlIQR1XuezXRhlHz2	Relaxing and getting stuff ready for the baby
K6Q7pMg71TQFlIQR1XuezXRhlHz2	Then we would be like robots but at the same time it would be nice 
K6Q7pMg71TQFlIQR1XuezXRhlHz2	Then we would all be the same 
K6Q7pMg71TQFlIQR1XuezXRhlHz2	My goal is to get normal household tasks done.  And I can go to bed earlier.  And I can put my phone down and do what I need to do to get it done and then go on my phone. 
K6Q7pMg71TQFlIQR1XuezXRhlHz2	Being pregnant with my first baby. 
K6Q7pMg71TQFlIQR1XuezXRhlHz2	Having dinner with my husband or just sitting watching videos with him maybe going out for a cigarette with him. 
K6Q7pMg71TQFlIQR1XuezXRhlHz2	I am expecting my first baby.  I got married in August.  So it'd be probably my husband and my baby. 
K6Q7pMg71TQFlIQR1XuezXRhlHz2	My husband came home and has been angry so he takes it out on me. I just want to be enough. And I want him to stop expecting so much from me because even when I do everything he wants me too some how it’s still not enough. 
K6Q7pMg71TQFlIQR1XuezXRhlHz2	Having my baby and seeing my husband be a dad
K6Q7pMg71TQFlIQR1XuezXRhlHz2	Give it to someone that needs it more I have everything I could ever want

K6Q7pMg71TQFlIQR1XuezXRhlHz2	Because I'm tired. So I feel the need to sleep.

K7AgokBQtzR91rNxkf2SbfYSalp2	How long has Brees been playing?  That's not what I meant at all. It's not Bruce that's playing. It's that I'm not really getting what I want in my career is not where I wanted to be. 
K7AgokBQtzR91rNxkf2SbfYSalp2	I don't know maybe a different change of scene. 
K7AgokBQtzR91rNxkf2SbfYSalp2	It's the fear of rejection that cannot affect me. 
K7AgokBQtzR91rNxkf2SbfYSalp2	I did some hypnotherapy to look at rejection as if I were talking to my inner child and understand what happened and why I feel rejected and how I can push through that. 
K7AgokBQtzR91rNxkf2SbfYSalp2	I don't need training to beat myself up I need.  Meditation to not be myself up. I need more self-love in my life and to encourage myself believe in myself. That's what I need.

KX3DONoVFxNSlXLjc4dzF9pX2Yx2	Will it take me in a day or two?  I don't know what that means but I don't know take I'm going to be philosophical in a day or two. Would I pick me know I think in a day or two, I'm going to be super stressed out English to be honest. It's not going to be good.  Song No at this point. I don't think I'd pick me in a day or two. 
KX3DONoVFxNSlXLjc4dzF9pX2Yx2	A boat. No, I don't think so.  Sunday quotes, that's like the humans. That's cuz I'm going to get to being a dolphin just get on a speedboat and ride that always messes up my hair. 
KX3DONoVFxNSlXLjc4dzF9pX2Yx2	Well people do have qualms about the speech kids saving their weird. Well, I shouldn't say people. I just do it speech kids in general. But like I said, they're super nice people, you know, I got to talk to them. I was like, oh my God, they were so great. I like oh my God Sydney, right like you're in this class in my head like yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and I was like, yeah. Yeah you are phone case. I was like, oh man bangs like I like your voice singing voice cuz they sang. Tell yeah, I like them. 
KX3DONoVFxNSlXLjc4dzF9pX2Yx2	I don't know. I can't help it. I guess I just  I don't know things really get to me and I feel like I have to succeed because there's a lot of pressure to succeed.  But I place that for sure myself. I'm not sure where it comes from. Musically. I don't know. I don't know why I wish I didn't but I do. 
KX3DONoVFxNSlXLjc4dzF9pX2Yx2	Amazing. I need free Like a Bird free bird like come on. You can just fly in and fly and fly flying fly.  I'd love to be in the sky flying into the sunset the wind at my back the leaves all around me.  She did great. 
KX3DONoVFxNSlXLjc4dzF9pX2Yx2	all the best people are fine, but  I don't know. It depends if something people are weird, I think.  I don't know that whole always / corner of the building is kind of feels like weird theater kids. Sorry, but  benches or colitis compare like theater kids and like the speech kids. I know people have said this thing about like speech kids, but they're really good, you know, so I don't mind the speech kids. 
KX3DONoVFxNSlXLjc4dzF9pX2Yx2	But I do one like probably every day. I haven't been doing this whole thing for 8 days, but I'd say it in a day. I would not be surprised if I did like 7 to 8. 
KX3DONoVFxNSlXLjc4dzF9pX2Yx2	To me the idea of character has always been popular.  I mean that serves the goal, but I think part of me knows that the way that I'm going or not going to get it.  You know, I was just what I want. I just want just want to take off and not look back for this. So unfeasible. I feel like that's why I obsess over it cuz I know I can't have it not at least the way I want to have it. 
KX3DONoVFxNSlXLjc4dzF9pX2Yx2	What's at the 80s but I just like the vibe. I like the aesthetic. I just think.  Like I want mixtapes and I want that old vintage feel and that's really what I'm aiming for.  It's just  Sims happier more Carefree if nothing matters except being free. 
KX3DONoVFxNSlXLjc4dzF9pX2Yx2	Yeah, I do. I really do I like being says philosophical. I think I would be. 
KX3DONoVFxNSlXLjc4dzF9pX2Yx2	I should start my school work. Yeah start at school. You know again, that's the problem with this app is if you think it's going to be a great and stuff and I can kind of peace out what you're saying, but not quite enough. Do you know?  I guess this is more for like later me then play go back and I see what was happening. Just pick her in the day and see what I was thinking that day, but it does happen. Hello future me, but knowing me up probably a bed in this app pretty soon. I don't want to though.  I know. Yeah, I really need to do some work. 
KX3DONoVFxNSlXLjc4dzF9pX2Yx2	I am not answering that question to you, but it's Sydney. 
KX3DONoVFxNSlXLjc4dzF9pX2Yx2	Well, I'm not a philosopher.  I'm not good at expressing my thoughts into words either but I think most philosophical people or philosophers are like they know what they're thinking and they know how to tell you what they're thinking. I can know what I'm thinking and have like a deep understanding that I can't convey super well just because it's like  if I get my head, but I don't know how to translate what's in my head to my mouth to your head the same way that it's in my head as it is. 
KX3DONoVFxNSlXLjc4dzF9pX2Yx2	I think this is only like my third maybe fourth, but probably third. 
KX3DONoVFxNSlXLjc4dzF9pX2Yx2	My mom came into my room and the way that she makes me look really actually upsets me cuz she just stands there and like usually Buttercup is on my bed because he sleeps with me. So I'll be there in the morning and she just like pets him and she waits for me like naturally wake up by like  Just heard presents and it really creeps me out like like a horrible way to get woken up and said I should like to say my name but like only once and like after I'm woken up like a bunch of big city. That's like all she'll do that really freaks me out and makes me mad. 
KX3DONoVFxNSlXLjc4dzF9pX2Yx2	How the band how is fine? I feel like it's filled with like nice people. But just back corner of the band hallway where they always sit and eat like not the band people but just like Molina's group.  I don't know. I think there's just a lot of negative memories with that corner. So I don't like the corner, but the rest of the hallway is fine, I guess. 
KX3DONoVFxNSlXLjc4dzF9pX2Yx2	Okay, first of all, I was talking about you for feeding your questions so I can while I'm kind of running low on time because I really have to go to the bathroom, and I'm going to go to bed soon. So bye. 
KX3DONoVFxNSlXLjc4dzF9pX2Yx2	She always talks about him. 
KX3DONoVFxNSlXLjc4dzF9pX2Yx2	I mean, I think I could but I don't think I would like  hold a candle stick to that mean I like if they know how to speak on these ideas and they like make a living out of it. You know, like I said, but I think they blow me away, but I guess you can't be wrong philosophically, or maybe you can  I don't know. 
KX3DONoVFxNSlXLjc4dzF9pX2Yx2	They don't stop repeating your questions, and at least let your questions make sense, please. 
KX3DONoVFxNSlXLjc4dzF9pX2Yx2	No, no God, this thing is so long. It's pissing me off. 
KX3DONoVFxNSlXLjc4dzF9pX2Yx2	I don't know to be honest. I'm not really feeling this question and I already  Things today like I did one of those braindumps, but then it was like start your first session and I just took this movie and I was like, okay, I'll do it just to hear the pop up. So that's the only reason I'm doing this twice in one day. 
KX3DONoVFxNSlXLjc4dzF9pX2Yx2	Probably Stress and Anxiety. 
KX3DONoVFxNSlXLjc4dzF9pX2Yx2	Well, I just got back from school. So I figured I'd  just kind of see how my day was, you know log it check it track it, you know, whatever.  I don't have too much homework today. But this whole English presentation thing. We have to find a mentor that's got me kind of frazzled not going to lie. Cuz of course it has I'm just crazy like that. But yeah.  can I throw you actually wanted to hear I don't know if it was weird because  Backpage, she keeps talking really boys and stuff and I can't get it. That's great like a giving you attention, but she's leading so many of them on all at once if I should all over like four different guys and they walk in the room and she looks at them that way and then she looks at me. She's like a man. That's him and I'm like Jesus Christ like Lisa for guys alone, you know, like, you know, and of course everything you read Tyler, but she didn't mention him today. I just kind of brought that on my own standoffish towards her during power because of it and I know it's not nice, but I really obviously can't help it.  Yeah, I might go to wrestling meet tonight. I honestly don't really want to but  I feel like I should just cuz a lot of people are going to be there.  Right now I'm kind of doing a few how come work early. So I'm getting there but  Other than that, I'm the baby was okay. It wasn't great. I don't have PE anymore this semester, which is a great but like so my class are kind of weird chemistry was good, but like scary. I don't know. I'm always afraid of chemistry just cuz it's tough which reminds me I'm taking a peek of next year and I just kind of like put that in Zello and everything and it's kind of scaring me not going to lie, but I figured anyone can do it. I know that I can you know, like I can do it. I know that it's just doesn't mean it's going to be easy.  Do we have a track meeting and I was late to it. And that was kind of embarrassing. He called me out. But that's fine Pages late to that was kind of my fault, but  basically, my life has been me checking my e-mail looking for responses from these poor doctors that don't want to let a child into their hospital and  Yes, I really wanted to start one of those like a dream log things. Like I saw it was a i thing on this app word, you know, but I don't really know how it works cuz I don't remember my dream last night.  So it's probably not a good place to start and I don't want to just like a lot of dreams that I remember from my childhood or anything. I mean I could cuz there's always one that stands out but it's a back to the Barnyard. I don't know if you know what that means or anything, but  it was a bad nightmare that I had where I got trapped in the van with the characters from Back To The Barnyard anyway, but  You know it is what it is.  Yeah, I should probably start all this now. I might come back to this to it. See what I can do, you know.  All right. Well, yeah, I really actually need to do this if you have homework, so I have to see if you've any follow-ups. 
KX3DONoVFxNSlXLjc4dzF9pX2Yx2	I just  I just want someone to say they're proud of me.  They support me no matter what.  Come up there always in my corner.  I just feel like  sometimes I try really hard.  I don't know if the one cares that doesn't matter, but I'm really trying to think no one notices it.  I just expected but I can't always give it which is why it's so hard to give it but I try and try to give it but like  I just want someone to be proud with me.  I want someone to tell me that.  How do I say good people out? There are?  Play don't tell me that I just feel like it's all for nothing like none of it even matters that nothing matters.  Why is life so hard?  Easier I don't want I don't want like a societal construct of anything. I don't want there to be a I don't want.  I don't want the world to be so structured.  I know I don't want.  I don't want laws. I don't want to tell him I don't want the schools. I don't want places of work. I just want to people and made her and  I'm just to be happy. I don't want my mommy. I don't want people to have to pay for food or processed food. I just  Is it going to be a little easier a little nicer little cool versus little more enjoyable?  Okay, I feel like I've had my moment.  Had my moment was a long moment.  buzzarab  Take a moment somewhere. I kind of want a therapist but like I don't want that kind of came out of nowhere, but I just feel like instead of talking to my phone. I can talk to a person.  I'm too introverted screwed that one up.  Can't tell people things so your phone, you know, my phone is probably telling like the government right now. What is the government care?  What what are they going to do with this information and some teenagers crying some teenager cries everyday?  back off topic  I guess I'm going to have to respond with text from my mom. 
KX3DONoVFxNSlXLjc4dzF9pX2Yx2	so I was feeling kind of sad because like  You never feel like.  the last the last like entry I guess that I did I was talking about like that whole friend group that like, I'm not a part of and  it's still really bothering me to be honest. Like it was it wasn't something where I was just like being dramatic that one day about like it really put some stuff in perspective and I was feeling kind of sad about it today just because I feel like  I don't know like in power a lot of them are there and even when I'm there I'm like not like with them. I feel like and it's just hard so I can set about that in so I went back and listened to the entry from last time and  that was an enlightening experience like it.  I was okay before listening to it. I was like sad and like I wanted to cry but like I didn't like know how they would listen to that and she's like two seconds and I was like the dam broke, you know.  I learned how to blow a bubble with bubblegum today.  It took me a really long time and I'm still not very good at it. But I got it, you know, sometimes it works and I thought it was cool.  I'm really hungry, but I don't have nothing to eat.  Felicia average like one meal a day  Are you guys still somehow? What kind of fat? Yeah, I guess I averaged more than one meal a day, but I think when in doubt I always get like one meal, you know, cuz I don't eat breakfast. Like lunch and that lunch very sometimes usually like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, which is like  And dinner that also varies like sometimes like tonight. It's nothing at all.  Sometimes it's not good, but I don't know. I'm really hungry right now, but  I'm not going to lie. I like kind of not in shape.  And you don't pay just keeps.  going on and on and on about how happy she is right now and how you know, she's going out with this guy and how he makes her so happy and everything is going her way right now and  how do I sound like an asshole but like like she can be happy like of course she can be happy but the heck that he has like go hurt, but it's just  I don't know her happiness brings me down because I realize that I am not happy like she's very happy and I'm like, oh  I have not happy. I'm sad and lonely.  And then thinking about being lonely because I am makes me even more sad.  And it's not that I'm sad. It's just her happiness is making me sad.  And that's really unfair of me to say but I mean, it's true.  This cousin jealous. I've never said that out loud before but I've always known that I'm jealous of her jealous of her happiness. I'm jealous of the way. She attracts guys like  And I always tell myself to make out cuz she's blond.  Does guys like blondes?  Willow tree. That is so cuz Molino's has a boyfriend.  But I just saying it's because she's blond is easier than saying because she's not me, you know, you know.  and I always feel like I'm  oh my God, I second choice to her, you know.  like  But every guy that ever like says anything to me, I like mention and Pages like oh, yeah, I like him was like whatever. I'm like  second choice again  I guess that's it, though. 
KX3DONoVFxNSlXLjc4dzF9pX2Yx2	well  It's Sunday, and I'm getting ready to go do homework with Paige a Cup of Jo.  An Astros are going to go to the laundromat and take some cute pictures. So I have like a couple looks you know, one more like retro I think and then one more like like a cute dress, you know, cuz I think it's cute.  And you know, I walk downstairs. My dad's all Lego, you know, what's up and my mom she's like, what do you wear in and I might go Lord. Here we go, cuz I thought I looked like fly and I was like feeling it.  And she's like you can't go out there looking like you're going to get bought.  It was just so.  Degrading like I'm not even a person and it was so gross. I got it made me really uncomfortable and she tries to like start a conversation about something else when I get all mad like it never happened, but it was just so disgusting and mean and  It made me really uncomfortable and I really didn't like it, but she doesn't care.  I don't know. I just read her my feelings because I left my mom and if my mom doesn't even support me than like.  Do you know?  Try not to cry about it because I'm wearing mascara and a little makeup. But you know, I don't know it just hurt my feelings that she doesn't like trust me anymore. She doesn't like.  I don't even know what it is. I don't think it's about trust it's just she doesn't.  It's almost like she wants something to change because I'm like a teenager in almost 16 now, but she wants to have that weird. Like she's a teenager. She knows all the stuff and I'm the mom who struggles to control her like it's like she wants that movie like Rebel teen thing.  And she's like creating it.  I don't know. Why just makes me sad.  Can I have some work to do and I tried to clean my room?  And it didn't really work because I cleaned like all the insides of my drawers but not like so much the tops of like my nightstands and stuff. So it's still kind of looks like cluttered but  On the inside. It's like much better.  Also Sidney Atkins and I have been Snapchatting not like actually just like pictures of like are literally pictures of the words. The only words were like  I don't know I can't help but hope that he'll make a move. I know he probably won't like, you know, we're not like Snapchatting Snapchatting or just like, you know back and forth weird conversation, but  I don't know.  So that's a development.  But what kind of all I guess for now. 
KX3DONoVFxNSlXLjc4dzF9pX2Yx2	Oki  I think I just pause this recording but I don't remember if I ever even started it. So I'm just going to start from the beginning.  So I took a shower today, but with all the lights off and it was interesting. It wasn't super eye-opening. It was kind of eerie. I don't know. I don't think I like some people like really enjoy it. So I was like all you know, why don't we try showering in the dark? Like see what that's all about, but I don't really like it. I find that I have a lot but I want to stay just to stay but I never start any type of journal entries the way that I  Want to or with anything that I want to say?  Cuz I have a journal of like  7 to 8 grade, you know and I always just started with something random before like getting to my actual point. I don't know just thought that was interesting. Also Kobe died yesterday, but you know, I'm not going to pretend to be a fan of basketball. I like  You don't like anything, but he seems like a really great guy and his daughter died with him. And I don't know it's just been going around and that's really sad. But like I said, I didn't really follow basketball, but she seems like a real down-to-earth person, you know.  Anyway, so my day let's start with yesterday.  Yesterday was sad. I feel like recently I'm just like  going unnoticed like I don't matter.  feel like I know I can be like oh, but I met her in my own world or like I matter in XYZ way, but  I don't know just with Paige and Melina specifically. I feel like I don't.  Like I'm not being seen or heard.  Like for Spanish, this is dumb. But for Spanish our seating chart has Paige and Melina like right next to each other at the same like pod and I'm like in the far back in a pod with no one else like I'm alone.  I don't know. It's kind of sad but  I like during English. Like I called the student-teacher over to ask her a question. And so I asked like the first part of my question and she answered and then pay Jester question cuz page sits right next to me and I kept trying to follow up my question but Pages just like kept interrupting me with her own questions, but Pages questions with things that should already answer. So I don't know I just really annoys me but it also kind of hurt my feelings.  I know it's down at probably shouldn't have hurt my feelings, but it's like I called her over and then  I feel like Pages kept like speaking over me like she didn't even care and she was kind of Lifestyle. She's like, oh my God, like sorry, but just like I guess it's better than nothing, but it still made me feel bad.  And then the other day.  I was texting Molina and she was like, where do you want to eat today? Because it was meant as hard power hour or so we can eat in. Mr. Bullman's room like we usually do and so I said I would. You usually go to the band hallway when Bowman's is closed and she's like, yeah, let's go there like we can work on cam.  And then I met her at the band hallway after I forgetting lunch and I'm show up and she's sitting next to a bunch of people already, which is fine. They're chatting it up.  And she never talks to me like we had this whole plan to do Cam and like let's figure it out together like that sang. You know, I was kind of excited. I was like, yeah like me and she didn't speak to me at all. She really look at me.  And the people there like I don't really know them. So I like I am not in their friend group. So I the whole time I was thinking like like what are they thinking like, why am I here like to do they even know my name like  And no one talk to me like that whole Power Hour and that really hurt. My feelings are really made me sad other Melina asked she was like Hey Sydney, like how do you do this one chemistry problem, and I told her I'm a girl sitting next to her repeated what I said to her.  And then she goes, oh my God, you're a genius.  and I was like, oh  is that really made me feel invisible? however, the whole thing with the chemistry question that I I just thought I wanted to help her because I knew how to do it and she didn't and she's kept talking to everyone else who like didn't really know how to do it, but  and I said the answer and then  the person sitting next to her said it wrong and then when it didn't work out there like, oh actually I said I have to do this after like I had said the answer and she was like, she literally said you're a genius and  and I think I was the only awkward she spoke to me in Power Hour, not the genius part. She said that to the person sitting next to her, of course.  I don't know. I just feel like  I really feel like everything is going by and  I don't know. I'm just kind of there.  then I tried to run after school page today and that made me feel bad because like  of course for doing workouts that are tailored to like her.  I like we don't run the same stuff. We don't do the same stuff. We we don't focus on the same stuff, but the workout was for her and I tried to join in and it was really discouraging.  I don't know.  And she had she said this weird thing. She's like we have them should do this diet together. I was like, yeah, let's diet. Her diet is just like don't eat lunch.  Play she calls it intermittent fasting.  International it's literally just you skip lunch and breakfast.  Which I skip breakfast anyway, but I don't see the point in it. It's just like eating less which that's not.  I don't know. It doesn't it doesn't seem worthwhile to me. It seems kind of weird and I don't want to do it and I probably won't.  I was going to try to keep a dream log, but I don't really have time. I was going to say I'll right after I wake up like I do not do a dream log, but I don't really have time to do that. But I do remember this one dream. I had not last night, but the other night I was skiing.  and  I was doing okay.  But it was like a black diamond course, but it was like the second Black Diamond core. So it's like I don't know the harder one of the black diamonds so I was going and I thought it was going okay, and then the mountain just got incredibly Steep and then I was falling and I was like doing somersaults in the air and like just falling really  For a long time and then I reach the bottom of the slope kind of came back.  And the endpoint was under the tree.  I had like to finish your time cuz I guess it was timed you had to touch the trunk of this tree, but it's like a big pine tree, so I got climb under it.  And I was under it, but I didn't know that you had to touch the trunk. So then I crawled to the trunk and touched it.  the phone's ringing  Anyway, I called to the trunk and touched it and then time stopped and I think my mom said like did uprr. Did you get a record like did you get your record? And I said yes because  I just had a ski coach they're like, oh, yeah you did but then I was really upset because I could have piard buy more if I had known that you had to touch the trunk of the tree to finish.  Thanks. I stop the timer.  And then I don't know we started walking for like two steps and then we were in like this weird.  It wasn't a chicken coop, but I don't know how else to describe it is like a very small wooden box. I told us that we could stand up in and they're like small windows that we had to climb out.  let me just climbed out the window and  that's all I remember I guess.  I think there's some deeper meaning to that because that was one of the more structured dreams that I've had. Usually my dreams like two or three different parts that just sort of abruptly end and start, you know, like it'll be like all I'm in the mall and then all the sudden, you know flying through the cosmos. I don't know about skiing and falling down the hill and then  Yahoo Some people didn't respond in that freak me out in the people that did respond. I don't even know if they're going to be able to do it because it's like so short notice and I really tried it like let them know as soon as I could but this one person that I really had all my eggs in her basket. I don't think she'll be able to do it because she's so busy, you know, which is respectable like she works in an ER  Miss that was done on my part. Maybe just to  choose that but I don't know what's really got me like.  freaked out  what else?  I don't know that's kind of it. I guess math has been remarkably easy lately. So that's always a win chemistry has been kind of hard relay about moles. And I don't know part of it's just not like clicking to grow.  But yeah, really the main thing I wanted to talk about was like the whole invisibility thing like at school and like in life and like every time I feel like it's going away like I meet someone new or like a branch out a little bit. I just I said it gets crushed by Page and Marina.  I'd like the guy I was talking to Paige had nothing, but crap to say about him.  But then he kept the he won't leave me alone. He was like, please like you don't understand. Give me a second chance. Like I really didn't mean.  Not give me a second chance. He didn't say that. He said that guy really didn't mean it the way you think I mean it cuz I was like, how are you texting other girls? He was like, well, I wanted to be there friends like  and I was like, okay and he was like I seriously like like you  Play let's work this out like you know, and I was like, okay, like I'll give it a shot.  So now we're like snapping. I mean it's nothing real but it just makes me sad that page and Lena have nothing but crap to say about him.  I feel like you're judging me constantly, but  vintage always brings me into her boy problems and I feel bad like judging her butt.  I know it's just hard and it just kind of hurts.  but then like every time I'm  I'm not the most outgoing person, but I'm very introverted. So I feel like every time I'm in a new friend situation Molina definitely monopolizes, but then I couldn't even page does to you.  And I don't know. I know it shouldn't like I know it's not meant to be rude like she they just genuinely want to talk to other people but it's like I want to talk to them too, but I don't feel like I know how as much as they do because I feel like they always have an edge like Molina knows a lot of people because she did by last year and Paige knows a lot of them because of cross-country. Like there's this one guy that we're talking to today during power and they knew because of cross-country and I just feel like I'm edgeless.  unlike you can say I call you but you two Traction in a fuel from there, but  most of the time people aren't very nice. I shouldn't say that I shouldn't say Moses is but like there's a larger group of people that are basically like the volleyball girls, but they like come over and do track Angela. Do you say this tastes like one hundreds and you know 60-meter Dash because they're not really out for track for the sport which is fine. Like you don't have to be super competitive in a sport to go out for it for fun. But I don't know and usually most last year I hung out with experience. It wasn't towards the end that we've formed early mid-distance long Sprint type group, but  I don't know. I guess that's kind of a tangent. I guess this whole thing is a tangent. But like maybe that's the point.  I have to get up early tomorrow and I really don't want to it's really just like wearing me down cuz we have lifting three times a week and  I get up at 5 for it and it's like getting up at 5 is hard enough, but then three times a week and then the other two days that we could get up at 6 and then do you have one day to sleep in cuz usually Sundays you don't get to sleep in?  I just feel I feel like it's wearing me down. I feel like it's really hurting me.  But what are you going to do about it?  Anyway, that's kind of all I have to say I guess.  Yeah. I don't think I have anything else for now. Okay, but that story about Power Hour when Molina just dismissed me completely and didn't talk to me at all and ignore me. I've been sitting on that one for two days.  still hurts  still fresh up in my mind and tell the journal so  jackbox 
KX3DONoVFxNSlXLjc4dzF9pX2Yx2	I don't know whatever. She wants she wants these. I don't know why.  She wants and she was mad at first smoking or vaping but I don't do that.  pictures of a home 
KX3DONoVFxNSlXLjc4dzF9pX2Yx2	Invited me to go to IHOP with her and shaded I said, yes because I will be friends. I don't know if I'm going to hang out. So I went and it was really funny really funny. Rhythm just said we're going to play at 5 on 5 basketball game, but we can't we didn't invite you because you're not really friends with us. It's not okay, cuz I'm not for I don't know. Do you make me feel like I don't really have any fruit.  Really sad I don't make myself a few more games to play with friends at 4.  I've been trying.  It hurts my chest.  I just thought it was so fun. But it is said that it isn't just ruined my night. But like it's through my whole life in the perspective.  Do you know what do I say page of movie time in Friends?  Really? There's nothing good friends, and I don't feel bad, but I don't have friends cuz they're not bad friends. Just making me feel bad right now. I don't even know.  Lebron leaving someone's home No one's home. But  I don't know like they're not my friends, but they're kind of acting like they kind of beef are being not great friends. I think it's not feel like they're doing anything.  and I can't even talk to other what is this about this because it's my  I don't know. I don't know what to do.  Golden spread to the whole village. That's nothing but it was a person like it's hard for me to be able and it's not my fault that it's just is I can't like watching people room in three places to talk to me in the first place.  I don't know what to do anymore. And Paige just snapchatted me. Of course. I don't know what to do.  What are reindeers?  I don't know. I don't know.  I know you talk to my parents about it cuz I quiet.  Pictures nice. I guess I'll just go up and see what she said.  Peter Peter asked me last night. We went to like Fairway or whenever she's like boys hurt my feelings and I'm like, I don't let them boys hurt your feelings too. And I said don't don't it's about boys, but that's her timeshare. It's my feelings.  My Kinda lover she's my best friends are really sometimes I feel like I'm not feel like it doesn't feel like it anymore. At least I feel like I don't even know who she is like a completely different person.  Ice cream sodas on my own really Isaac has been a better friend to me this year and she has but I'm not being a good friend to a later.  Plano High School bullshit, but  right now it doesn't feel like it like right now it feels really bad, but it looks like a couple of years it won't matter but right now it matters. 
KX3DONoVFxNSlXLjc4dzF9pX2Yx2	Okay. So here's the deal. I've been talking to that one guy a lot more than I mention other day. His name is Luis in a month of Taiwan even know his name, you know, like it's really just for fun and my crew.  You know just experienced. I guess the kids really like nice and he's really cute and stuff and like  he's kind of a player but like  I think that's given take with all those CF guys because they hate no.  obviously, they're not all going to be like  play two players.  but  I just I don't know what it is about page, but she keeps just like a wrecking on him like this person said there is like they think that is what like she's never talked to him, but she just keeps bringing me down about it. And it's making me feel really bad.  Yo-yos made me sad because he seems super nice and like we've been talking and I don't know. She's like she she's page says it like he talks to other girls and stuff and I don't know. She's just making me really sad about it, but then she won't leave me alone with her boy problems. Then she just comes in like rips on the guy that I'm talking to it. It makes me upset, you know, if you're not even going to be nice to me about it, you know.  I don't know. She's just really dramatic sometimes don't get me wrong. I love her like we're just hanging out tonight, but you know high schools a weird time.  And I can't help you with your problem. But I don't want to hear it. I'm sick of it. There's a lot going on right now. And like I'm not sure to be at your beckon call whenever this happens are like tell you what the right move is. And cuz she's not even listening. I shall ask me something and I'll tell him my opinion. I'll tell her what I think is right, but she didn't listen to  Make sure you at likes the drama. She likes the attention and like that's fine. You can like that and you can think it's exciting but then stop complaining about it cuz you're actively seeking it out and it just really gets on my nerves sometimes.  And yeah, I just I don't know it's just weird. But Louis is pretty nice. I didn't feel very nice because we've been talking for like a full day now, but he's like  He's really cute and seems genuinely interested in getting to know me.  She asked if we would ever be more than friends and you know, I was kind of hesitant because we let it be now. We have yet to meet face-to-face whenever but I was just letting you know. Well we haven't met but I can Thursday though. There could be something there because I really do think that there could be.  What kind of all?  yeah, I don't know chose pretty slow by grandparents house, but 
KX3DONoVFxNSlXLjc4dzF9pX2Yx2	Okay, I literally just add one of these like a brain dump. So I'm going to keep this brief, but I forgot to say that I downloaded Facebook today.  All Jay-Z's crying Saturday name in bed.  I forgot to say that I downloaded Facebook today was just kind of weird.  Yeah, and also I want to start dating these brand on. So today is  January 28th. January 28th 2020  but  okay, that's really all I had to say. Good night. 
KX3DONoVFxNSlXLjc4dzF9pX2Yx2	So this boy just who's in my health class. He added me on snap and Instagram and then started sniffing me and he's honestly really cute and like kind of funny end.  Sorry, I'm eating dinner. But like there's a mistake because in the span of an hour. I've already caught feelings.  I'm a little touch talk about it and send it to page. But then she facetimes me and I was like, okay, whatever like I don't really want to talk about my boy. It's up to you. I don't want you talking about your voice up to me, but it should I come out to visit unlike his name is Luis. She's a girl with the blue butterfly Emoji. He started slapping me to I was like, oh like, okay.  Whatever and she's like how I can stop snapping if you want and I was like, yes, like I don't need you leading him on to like stay away from my man's in like 10 minutes. He won't be friends anymore, but I have to get ready and I'm trying to break us apart a friend. Like I'll get ready for what should I go to DD's coming over on my God.  Have fun.  Well, I'm in bed.  Eating alone thinking about the plans that we made yesterday to hang out tonight while you're hanging out with someone else.  Final it's fine time. 
KX3DONoVFxNSlXLjc4dzF9pX2Yx2	Well, I mean if it was all I knew I was going to be missing a whole lot. But if it changed from the way we see now got to be horrible.  I just be so sad. So Bland, you know.  But like I said, I don't if we didn't know that color was out there then.  Just being normal and it'll be like nothing changed. So it wouldn't matter. 
KX3DONoVFxNSlXLjc4dzF9pX2Yx2	I'm starting to think these questions are never going to end if Earth was flat.  I don't know. I needed further still around then.  Got a whole lot would change.  When would we have to worry about falling off but that must feel like help us at all. I don't know if it's kind of a shallow question hate to break it to you. 
KX3DONoVFxNSlXLjc4dzF9pX2Yx2	I like to sleep for like 9 to 12 that I sleep for about 7 sometimes 6 
KX3DONoVFxNSlXLjc4dzF9pX2Yx2	spring break definitely going to ask you to the Cayman Islands again, and I've been  once  r twice  maybe twice  But I don't know I can't remember is that it once or twice and I've been to Mexico but this year we're going to the Cayman Islands again. I'm super excited for that. 
KX3DONoVFxNSlXLjc4dzF9pX2Yx2	Okay, well.  I don't really know how this works, but I'm just going to try it out I guess.  So Paige just facetimed me telling her that Tyler texted her and said he wanted to catch up.  and she she always dumps her problems on me her boy problems and  I know that I come off as annoying about it, but I hate.  I hate.  I hate talking about it with her. I just wish you would stop doing it. I don't really want to hear about her latest boy, especially when it's Tyler cuz she said she said there was a time when he really meant something to me.  And she knows I told her that I had a crush on him so juvenile.  She knows that she meant something to me to.  It was a long time ago, but it really it really stuck. And then I went to Camp One Summer Night. I came back and everything was different and he moved on and he shows her and  they always choose her and  she just  and then she comes to me and just tells me she hasn't asked any direction. She's talking like for guys right now and she's all like over all of them.  Don't have to rub it in.  I just I  I don't know and I tried to Channel all of it as hate towards Tyler just because she hated him for whatever reason but now she doesn't is just easier for me to hate him to  I miss him. He was funny and  I was like Smitten by him a little Elementary School me but I was I really was.  he chose her and  I guess I'll always choose her.  And she always choose them.  Whoever it is She'll always choosing.  Mental come crying back to me when something is wrong and I try to tell her I just like just tell them.  Just listen Chisholm. Keranen.  I don't know.  I should go to bed anyways. 
KX3DONoVFxNSlXLjc4dzF9pX2Yx2	All right, so I'm going to go to bed right now. But I just wanted to let this be known as a starting point for this journaling thing. I'm going to really try to keep up with it. I think because  I don't know. I think it could be good. So I just wanted to put it out into.  The universe that I'm going to try this one and see how it works and yeah, I hope to talk a lot more. 
KX3DONoVFxNSlXLjc4dzF9pX2Yx2	Tell me that I get stressed very easily and very often and I worry a lot. I worry about a lot of things. 
KX3DONoVFxNSlXLjc4dzF9pX2Yx2	I'm going to do this is just like a day summary and not like let my emotions out, you know, because I think there's other times for that and I kind of just did that but I got woke up today which kind of sucks because life weekends are the only time that I can sleep in so that really made me mad so I got woken up by my mom and I went to my grandparents house had lunch there which the food is not very good. That's just what I ordered. I continue to order like Alfredo, but I'm really convinced that I don't even like Alfredo so I keep ordering it. So I kind of like that myself into bed. Anyway, we came home and then I hang out with page for a long time. We went to cup-a-joe and then IHOP, which is really funny cuz we're just like driving around like ended up at our house and I have that was funny. What kind of harassing the waiters like that actually the weirdest thing being annoying not like to them a little bit.  Yeah, and then we drove around and tried to make friends with people in their cars by Exterminating in with music. That was kind of funny.  And she dropped me off and I fear band. 
KX3DONoVFxNSlXLjc4dzF9pX2Yx2	I mean, I feel like of course you want to go back in like live great memories then doesn't that just take away from them?  You can get so caught up in the past. That way you won't think about what those memories really meant to you. Cuz if you just have them at your disposal than you got to take them for granted, but if you don't have immediate access to those Beacon still remember and recall what you learned from them, I think that's more important.  and yeah, like those memories will always be there in like the form of pictures, but if you could  Just like a replay that moment in time. I think it would lose some of its grandeur. 
KX3DONoVFxNSlXLjc4dzF9pX2Yx2	I think the easiest for me to answer be capped just because I'm like I love cats but oh God realistically like a bird like a great Majestic bird when they could fly flies fly wherever wanted.  Like a dolphin so they can swim.  fast as I could I just want to be free like let out all the  All the stuff that I have, you know, I figure the ocean in the air are too fast places where you can just run or fly or Swim. You don't have to look back. You know, you don't have to think about much you can just  have open land free to do anything. 
KX3DONoVFxNSlXLjc4dzF9pX2Yx2	I'm going to be honest. I don't really know what that means not free like a bird on what?  Sounds a tough question to answer should be capped because you're like a dolphin but not free like a bird. I got to take that as I want to be.  Like a dolphin that I'm not free.  Not your finest moment there Journal. 
KX3DONoVFxNSlXLjc4dzF9pX2Yx2	I could go back in time if I could go back like as far as I wanted I go take the 80s.  I want a time before the iPhone when roller rinks were thing and like  Neon was a thing. Like I want to go take a disco Rave. I want to get on my bike and like just ride until the sun sets. I don't want to have to deal with this Modern Life I want.  I want the picture perfect life in the 80s.  I think that would be what I would go back to. 
KX3DONoVFxNSlXLjc4dzF9pX2Yx2	Tell me the beach. I love the beach. I love the Ocean Isle of like getting pictures on the beach. I know it's kind of dumb. But like I'm just the break from everything like it's completely different than Iowa. Like it's so beachy and tropical and I love everything about it.

L9UwWz5qhBVPxRdLwUZTNyIzO563	Thanks. I just feel like I have so much to offer the world I literally do nothing about it. I talk about it all the time but I never do anything to change how I feel. I literally wake up and do that same thing every day without even accomplishing anything. I wanna feel like I’m making a change and I wanna feel like I’m going down the right path. I’m still young and I feel like while I’m young I should be living my life to the fullest and actually experiencing things out in the world. Don’t let anything hold you back and do something great. 
L9UwWz5qhBVPxRdLwUZTNyIzO563	Why did I have a bad dream while no one was here 
L9UwWz5qhBVPxRdLwUZTNyIzO563	Im actually getting old and it’s no good lol 
L9UwWz5qhBVPxRdLwUZTNyIzO563	I felt alarmed like if it was real and there was something actually there.
L9UwWz5qhBVPxRdLwUZTNyIzO563	Life will throw me curveballs, but I am ready for them. 
L9UwWz5qhBVPxRdLwUZTNyIzO563	Coming back home to sleeeeeppp lol

L9UwWz5qhBVPxRdLwUZTNyIzO563	Well in the dream I was sleeping, and I felt like this really bad presence. I was trying and trying to wake up but I couldn’t. I felt something really heavy on me not trying to let me go. So I prayed and prayed until I finally got myself to wake up.
L9UwWz5qhBVPxRdLwUZTNyIzO563	My dad actually got me something 
L9UwWz5qhBVPxRdLwUZTNyIzO563	I have no idea. I didn’t watch anything scary that night.

L9UwWz5qhBVPxRdLwUZTNyIzO563	Well I basically want to leave my job and find something that I want to do. But it’s hard when you have no idea what you want to do or even just taking that jump to push yourself. It’s scary.
L9UwWz5qhBVPxRdLwUZTNyIzO563	I didn’t have any goals today so I didn’t accomplish anything.
L9UwWz5qhBVPxRdLwUZTNyIzO563	I somewhat have communication skills.

L9UwWz5qhBVPxRdLwUZTNyIzO563	 Nothing really just wasn’t a bad day really 
L9UwWz5qhBVPxRdLwUZTNyIzO563	Yes and no. Yes because most of it is for bills no because I buy things I don’t need 
L9UwWz5qhBVPxRdLwUZTNyIzO563	Get out in the world and succeed don’t give up 
L9UwWz5qhBVPxRdLwUZTNyIzO563	Have to just work mostly .
L9UwWz5qhBVPxRdLwUZTNyIzO563	Angry , low self confidence.
L9UwWz5qhBVPxRdLwUZTNyIzO563	Music I guess and telling myself things will change and you will do better 
L9UwWz5qhBVPxRdLwUZTNyIzO563	You never win with customers 
L9UwWz5qhBVPxRdLwUZTNyIzO563	It’s been a pretty chill day.
L9UwWz5qhBVPxRdLwUZTNyIzO563	Don’t overthink things that shouldn’t be overthought .
L9UwWz5qhBVPxRdLwUZTNyIzO563	Today is my birthday and it went pretty better then I thought it would🙂
L9UwWz5qhBVPxRdLwUZTNyIzO563	I mean I’m still handling it as the days go but I guess it’s just making me a stronger person.

LH1BFxILQSa4eHJRGlF1lhpyxSs1	I've always got them back from their father's house on Mondays.  And our schedule just changed last week and I lost custody.  to your dad  he lied and he  cold horrible untruths about me  he  Is angry because his daughter doesn't trust him.  So we started a custody battle and I lost my children because my daughter knew too much about the case of all the things he did.  I lost all custody because of that.  And now I don't get to see them. 
LH1BFxILQSa4eHJRGlF1lhpyxSs1	because she's  15  she's not a young child.  and  she knows things because she's almost an adult.  And she's not naive and dumb to it.  things like  hearing a conversation or seeing a piece of paper from the court documents in a file or  Being the one to experience an event and then have her father lie to her face about it. She just has had her own experiences and asks questions.  And can see things.  So I didn't exactly encourage her to not want to be with her father and I did not encourage her.  to Buck up against him  but  she's old enough to have questions. Sometimes it's questions like  How much longer before I don't have to carry all these bags to school mom how much longer before we know what our what our schedule is going to be?  on a on a solid basis  fake living in limbo the most important years of her life  So when she asked not to see how miserable she is. I don't think it's not trying to alienate her parentally by telling her that well trial is on February 12th and 13th. So  that's when we'll know.  Just don't see how it's parental alienation. 
LH1BFxILQSa4eHJRGlF1lhpyxSs1	Today would have been better.  If it was a normal Sunday, and I would be seeing my kids tomorrow.  But they won't be coming home tomorrow like normal. 
LH1BFxILQSa4eHJRGlF1lhpyxSs1	I've made a big mistake that cost me custody of my children.  It was never intentional.  And it was not parental alienation on purpose.  but  I  talk to my daughter and allowed her to know.  about the case  and  my guilt is overwhelming. 
LKMGWZzvrgYhkrUbVqN0EZxxqO82	Help others and get a good job.

LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	I was stressed before school because I kept thinking about how everybody thinks. I'm perfect and I'm not perfect. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	You heard me wrong chocolate and dogs are my dream. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	I'd rather stay at home cuz schools just Willis. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	I felt awkward about seeing my brother because like like I didn't have my phone. I just don't watch them and they were talking and none of my friends were there. So, I just kind of try to talk to his friends, but they're older than me, so I didn't really know how to talk to them. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	A lot like everyone we all have like this Universal game that every 6th grader knows that it's fun, but like other grades and don't know it. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	I just really don't get all their kids because like, you know, they talked about different things like with my grade is just like games and stuff and everybody knows what's going on over there. They're talking about completely different stuff that I didn't know. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	I don't know how to answer that. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	I would go to a different room because my room is not okay. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	Practice for steps, I mean test before before the night before it's going to happen. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	Nothing that exciting happen today and nothing that bad happened either. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	Oh, no, I'm not really feeling like talking. I'd rather just keep to myself right now. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	Probably be happy cuz a lot of my friends get sad when I'm sad. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	I mean everything in school was good. But like I'm just stressed cuz everyone at school thinks I'm just perfect little girl that gets straight A's and nothing happens is just straight. If you have a great surprise to me everything that could be easy for me, but it's not like that. I wanted the most stress people in my whole school and its really annoying cuz everyone's years ago and it's payday cake that has its good as you should know who I really am every time I go to school after put this filter on to act like how everybody thinks I act its really annoying. I just keep stressing and I don't know it's hard to explain. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	Because I have a band test tomorrow and I don't think I'm ready. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	I usually achieve that by putting my phone in a different room than me because that's how I get usually get distracted by my phone. I also go night different room than my bedroom because even though my bedroom has the desk bike. There's so many things in my bedroom that I can get distracted with. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	I would say hi. My name is arnoult. My birthday is on April 15th. How are you? I've been in charter school since kindergarten. I'm a charter babe. I like horse riding. I like softball and pretty active. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	So I walk into school and all my friends are there and there they give me gift since about 9 Thursday. I get them two gifts. I got for them. Everyone's really happy the environment around me is very happy. Nothing bad happens. Everything says happy. Also, my mom is taking me for dinner and today was early release. So yeah. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	Probably in the school's class when I told her I was sick, and she said his name to take the test and also watching my brother with his friends. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	I mean they just talked to my friends talk to you and yeah, that's pretty much it. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	The world would be a better place, but everyone's not going to be kind of a time. So that's not possible. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	We would not pet cruises which it sucks cuz I love cruises. So yeah. Yeah, I'm no bruises. No life. No life death to death equal suicide. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	Cuz she's an ass holes out. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	I have a sore throat today and in band everybody was like the Meg on or not. You always forget your weeds and they were being like that but missed call told them I was sick cuz I'm not really feeling that well and then and Miss Rojas is classified lost my homework and mr. Williams class actually went pretty nice and then after school at compactness Rojas class because I had club with her and then they are I felt lost my phone. I forgot my phone actually at home. I don't know what time it is very stressful, but it wasn't the stressful day. I've had so I meow 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	I have this feeling in my stomach that I'm not prepared for the next day of school for the next thing and then I think I'll have a test at 3 weeks. I have to start studying. I'm going to feel like right before I go to sleep. I just have all of these thoughts. I also get stressed throughout the day to stress is one of my main problems. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	My goal is to do homework and other things when it's given instead of waiting for the last minute and what I need to do to attain it is just stop going on my phone that often. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	I am pissed and I want to die. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	I the motion that I feel thankful for is relief when I first then have to take my test cuz I'm nowhere near prepared for the test and second when I got my phone right beside. I forgot my phone but it's either that I lost it or I forgot my phone and when I finally saw it in my bedroom, and I was relieved. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	Um, yeah, it's mainly of homework assignments and everything have to do and fan test cuz like I'm good at every subject except for band. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	anger sadness  sometimes I was feeling happy to but not really. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	Clear about like a story about this girl wanting dogs never gets dogs and coming out dogs because dogs are my love and chocolate chocolate and dogs my favorite things ever. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	I would probably get out more have fun more make more games probably have more time for homework. There be a lot of UPS to it. But then again I also might be bored have nothing to do sometimes and sometimes nobody wants to do anything. They just want to relax but I want to do something. So that's when I get on my phone and if it's not there then I might just be bored, you know. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	Because I do so much work and school run it home. I just want to rest but I can't rest because our school give so much homework. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	Coming that may be happy today is it's Valentine's Day and all of my friends got me gifts and instead of learning in school. We did so many fun activities. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	Miss Gonzalez because she had a sore throat and she sounded like she was going to cry so I felt really bad for her. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	I feel grateful that I decided to share my sentences with the class instead of being nervous like always. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	I did notice notice my heart racing and I was shaking like during science. I started shaking and one of my best friend, She's always there for me. And yeah, and she was there and then she try she told me calm down. Yeah whenever I'm stressed my heart starts racing and I start shaking. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	My reaction is that I'm crying right now and that I want to die. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	I had the best day ever. It was like the funnest day this whole year so far. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	It's been okay, not that great, but not bad either stressful as always. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	I would never be tired because then I wouldn't have to go to sleeping late and then everything would just be fine and I will be ready for all the tests. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	Probably to deep breathe. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	Cuz there's never been a day in school where I come and not one person has been sad. Usually like a couple people are sad. They're like, they don't want to go to school promotion time. I'm stressed out inside to today. Nobody was sad today. Nobody was stressed say everything was perfect. I love 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	You must have misunderstood me. They are happy you all everybody was happy today. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	Probably maybe a chocolate factory and someone really wants chocolate and then they have a dog so I might get her and you know, like chocolate and dogs are my dream. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	Yeah, I pray about that all the time. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	Because like home there's a see their food and piano. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	Because I'm very bad at playing my oboe. And yeah. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	I felt very sleepy. And yeah, I tried to relax. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	The way Miss Gonzalez changed her personality when the central people came here. It was the funniest thing ever. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	So I start feeling stressed I start shaking and then Emma notices that I was shaking and then she asked me if I was all right, and I explained to her and then she tells me to rate my stress and then calms me down by trying meme trying to make making you relax by saying so many relaxing things Emma's really helpful. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	She was fine because it was her car. So like she didn't really care. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	I have no idea what that means, but it sure. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	I felt really bad because sore throats hurt and she had one. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	I'm not really there's nothing primarily causing my stress maybe like some things like a test that's near are like that. But mostly it's just everything causes stress. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	Just have fun relax because my friends, you know, all the stuff you do on Valentine's Day. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	Once I had to sleep at 1 a.m. Because I procrastinators my homework and instead of doing it throughout the week. That was given I did it the night before so that night. I stayed up till 1 a.m. And I was tired very very tired the next day at school. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	I procrastinate like right after school and with my homework and things I do it but like going on social media eating watching Netflix. So yeah, just being on my phone. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	I used to procrastinate on my homework. Like let's say they give us a week to do the homework. I usually do it the night before and then on that night. It's very stressful and sometimes even test like tomorrow. I have a test and I haven't studied at all. So I'm going to have to study today and today only. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	Oh maybe by like calling myself down by practicing and seeing that I'm prepared for the test. And yeah. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	I passed the test and band. I do really good on the test and band and that's it. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	Nothing. I had a great day. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	My phone because I would be bored as hell. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	so basically in history, we have this project and never  keep doing this weekend. We're going to do a project together.  Because she keeps everything and she doesn't care about her grades cuz she can see something but I could straining and it's so hard to keep that if I'm with her and it's so annoying and keeps cancelling after canceling after giving for stupid reasons. Like she's going to the movies are going to the mall like this so I can't smoke so much because she's just doing nothing and it's so annoying I hate her. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	When I rode with Miss Rojas in her car to go to a math competition, it was really embarrassing. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	Helping people whenever they needed or like not like, you know. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	Not all the time, but today yes. 
LKt9eqUx0Vh8Zq0DkV77JIDgP8n2	For all my tests to be over.

Lajav52NDoaCRc2aRVLNhVErlp92	I follow the standards other people have already set then adjust where I need it to
Lajav52NDoaCRc2aRVLNhVErlp92	My daughter. I want to show her she can have it too. I wasn’t shown that
Lajav52NDoaCRc2aRVLNhVErlp92	Haha I think maybe boring is just relaxed when you want to be doing something else
Lajav52NDoaCRc2aRVLNhVErlp92	I think people become teenagers at 13. It ends at 19 
Lajav52NDoaCRc2aRVLNhVErlp92	I used to think it was lonely. Now it is pretty relaxing honestly. Sometimes boring, but not scary 
Lajav52NDoaCRc2aRVLNhVErlp92	I value experience but I do need to be in better control of that and be more patient for experience so I can also fulfill adult duties 
Lajav52NDoaCRc2aRVLNhVErlp92	I was looking for an app to help me with mood tracking, learn to discuss my emotions and thoughts in healthy ways, become less codependent, and control my possible manic dipolar disorder.
Lajav52NDoaCRc2aRVLNhVErlp92	I am totally financially capable
Lajav52NDoaCRc2aRVLNhVErlp92	"I am an adaptable person
No kidding. But I want to stay adaptable to the situation, not within my personality. "
Lajav52NDoaCRc2aRVLNhVErlp92	Overcoming my fear of roller coasters with chase in circus circus
Lajav52NDoaCRc2aRVLNhVErlp92	"Feeling fine on my own
This morning just reflecting and having a nice time
Flirting and casual texting with chase and him actually wanting to hear from me "
Lajav52NDoaCRc2aRVLNhVErlp92	We’d likely be more efficiently and hopefully more adventurous
Lajav52NDoaCRc2aRVLNhVErlp92	Our time would be spent more efficiently and we’d be more fit
Lajav52NDoaCRc2aRVLNhVErlp92	I got a lot done. Not all my goals. But a lot none the less
Lajav52NDoaCRc2aRVLNhVErlp92	Chase. This nice hotel room. Cuddles. Hotel shower stuff. 
Lajav52NDoaCRc2aRVLNhVErlp92	"Relaxing day. Got a lot done. When Rhiannon came home all was good till the evening time. Marcus got home and tried to help with stuff I didn’t find it helpful. I only wanted him to do what I asked for, not extra stuff too. 
Went out with Maddie to the store
Caught up just a little bit "
Lajav52NDoaCRc2aRVLNhVErlp92	Right for society standards, no. Right for me? I value experience over bills so yes
Lajav52NDoaCRc2aRVLNhVErlp92	I feel very open minded and non judgmental, I may feel it a bit more internally than I show. But I accept it and it doesn’t form my actions toward others 
Lajav52NDoaCRc2aRVLNhVErlp92	Independence. Because I think I am strong enough to have it and I’m done being afraid
Lajav52NDoaCRc2aRVLNhVErlp92	A little of both I think. I’m a leader but I start off with following

Lajav52NDoaCRc2aRVLNhVErlp92	"My body is full of energy. 
Honestly right now I’m a bit over energized and it seems like that over energy is also a bit anxious so I know that predisposes me to anger and being snappy"
Lajav52NDoaCRc2aRVLNhVErlp92	Would be better if this app stopped crashing BF
Lajav52NDoaCRc2aRVLNhVErlp92	I’m not like other people. I am growing in ways that are healthy for the majority of people though so I guess I’m going to start looking a little more generic to general people 
LfIYBfDoLlUpZRK1FxVKBpDts063	Find a solution for my work. 
LfIYBfDoLlUpZRK1FxVKBpDts063	Became successful. Businessman. 
LfsrBma2jFUV2X7OuTyH2nl1Sri1	It’s always fun to see concerts with friends especially country ones 
LfsrBma2jFUV2X7OuTyH2nl1Sri1	I hate it. Honestly I am miserable. 
LfsrBma2jFUV2X7OuTyH2nl1Sri1	My name is robin, I am 29 years old. I currently work in law enforcement and have a bachelors degree from CSULB. On my free time, I like to explore nature, go hiking, kayaking, and going camping.  I am a lover of country music and would like to see as many concerts as possible. 
LfsrBma2jFUV2X7OuTyH2nl1Sri1	Sometimes I wish I could do better right now.  But I feel like there's a lot of things happening around me that I have no control over.  And a lot of things that are happening hard so great.  I miss my grandma who just passed away recently.  And I really really wish that Chris was here to be with me at this time.  He and I are still friends and he spoke to me recently, but  I miss as well.  Today cuz stop thinking about him. I also going to stop thinking about my grandma's funeral next week.  I wish you can make it and I was you'll be there, but I know that if I invited him myself.  He might not even go because he never really met my family.  Never really had the interests to do. So some kind of hoping that he'll just go on his own initiative.  I know it's asking for a lot, but  I just want some I guess and right now I could really really use him.  Just for support but at the end of the day, I know that.  since our break-up  I can do things on my own and that I don't need him to be okay, because I can be okay on my own.  I guess there's a difference between  Wanting him and needing him.  I want him but at the end of the day, I don't need him.  So that's what I've been feeling today. 
LfsrBma2jFUV2X7OuTyH2nl1Sri1	I am currently having a rough time in my personal life and work. I’ve been told that I lack confidence and that I am my biggest enemy. Self doubt is what holds me back per my supervisor and those around me. 
LfsrBma2jFUV2X7OuTyH2nl1Sri1	Work was alright today, but for some reason a lot of the day was spent missing a particular someone 
LfsrBma2jFUV2X7OuTyH2nl1Sri1	Become a better version of myself than before 
LfsrBma2jFUV2X7OuTyH2nl1Sri1	Today is a different type of day where I feel kind of emotions anger regret sadness over my grandma's passing.  Sadness that Chris and I are no longer together.  Hopeful because I heard from him recently, but I'm not exactly sure what that is kind of hoping that you know, it'll progressed, but I don't really hear from him everyday.  tired mentally physically  Just been a lot going on this past couple weeks into the year.  It kind of makes me sad because it's just the beginning of the year and yet there's so much Death Around Me.  Send us capable and sometimes.  I feel like I'm never going to be okay.  I'm never going to get used to the fact I will never see my grandma again.  I miss her a lot. And I miss Chris too. 
LfsrBma2jFUV2X7OuTyH2nl1Sri1	Yes.  there was a time when I was with Chris for 2 years and  I took it upon myself to alienate myself from my family.  There's so many times where I could have seen my grandma to nursing home, but I didn't because all I wanted to do is be with Chris.  All I wanted to do is just be around him and no one else and for that I took my family for granted and is something I'm always going to regret especially now that my grandma is gone.  I want to make things right with all the other people around me, especially with my cousins, but the one person that can ever make it right with as someone who's already gone and that's my grandma. 
LfsrBma2jFUV2X7OuTyH2nl1Sri1	I think the biggest thing that's making me feel down at this moment is fact my grandma passed.  That is the biggest thing for me at this moment.  I miss her.  and I regret the fact that  I never get more time with her.  Then I did before and I took that for granted.  I think you feeling down house things to do with my current position as at work as well.  A micro standing with Chris which frustrates me of bed.  I think in totality everything is connected with each other and that's what's bringing me down. 
Lh7DjXpf7SVZqOztBRiCDxxY12W2	I've had a great day today overall pretty good cuz I can't complain. 
Lh7DjXpf7SVZqOztBRiCDxxY12W2	Help me be a better person
Lh7DjXpf7SVZqOztBRiCDxxY12W2	I have been through a lot I lost my daughter
LizBok2srbdlkXgKbeJZ3UqNRLx2	Today, the newer thoughts were more positive. I think.
LizBok2srbdlkXgKbeJZ3UqNRLx2	I’m not sure. I guess some people turn to religion. Some people look for answers in philosophy. Maybe look into scientific answers to the question. And some people who don’t understand life decide that it’s not for them and they commit suicide.
LizBok2srbdlkXgKbeJZ3UqNRLx2	Well not right now. With where I’m staying right now it would be inconvenient to unpack. Once I have my own space I’ll be able to unpack.
LizBok2srbdlkXgKbeJZ3UqNRLx2	New bedroom. And my dad and grandpa.
LizBok2srbdlkXgKbeJZ3UqNRLx2	Well, not scream at people and spit at their cars. I would probably just walk around and look at all the cool things. Maybe go to a park? Politely ask for some help? 
LizBok2srbdlkXgKbeJZ3UqNRLx2	Me. If I unpacked down here, I would have to pack everything back up to move upstairs, then unpack everything again. I also don’t have much storage space where I’m at right now.
LizBok2srbdlkXgKbeJZ3UqNRLx2	They don’t hate it. They got it for me as a gift.
LizBok2srbdlkXgKbeJZ3UqNRLx2	I mean, I guess it’s one way. But there are no solid answers in philosophy.
LizBok2srbdlkXgKbeJZ3UqNRLx2	No, I don’t think so. Thank you for chatting with me though. I appreciate it.
LizBok2srbdlkXgKbeJZ3UqNRLx2	Not especially. My anxiety and being scared is from getting out of the house, and knowing I’m going to need to do it again next week. My sadness could be from anything, really. Or nothing. I’m not sure.
LizBok2srbdlkXgKbeJZ3UqNRLx2	New thoughts? I’m not sure. I was pleased to pet the cat. I got a present and felt happy because of that. I was proud of my little sister for using her manners. But not really a ton of new thoughts, I don’t think.
LizBok2srbdlkXgKbeJZ3UqNRLx2	My new opinion is that life is such a struggle, and if I can’t see the beauty in it I don’t understand why I’m still here.
LizBok2srbdlkXgKbeJZ3UqNRLx2	I thought about how pretty soon I’ll be able to move into my new bedroom. And I’ll be able to unpack more, have space for my things, and start to feel more at home.
LizBok2srbdlkXgKbeJZ3UqNRLx2	It’s 1am and I can’t sleep. I kinda feel down. I’m wondering what’s so great about life and why people say it’s a blessing to wake up every morning and be alive.
LizBok2srbdlkXgKbeJZ3UqNRLx2	Anxiety. Overthinking. Self-loathing. Unable to cope with existence. Wondering what the point is. Worrying about how I’ve acted or things I’ve said.
LizBok2srbdlkXgKbeJZ3UqNRLx2	Seeing about watching football.
LizBok2srbdlkXgKbeJZ3UqNRLx2	I’m looking forward to my shower. And getting to walk the dog. If I could message and talk to some friends, that would be cool.
LizBok2srbdlkXgKbeJZ3UqNRLx2	My dad. Although he doesn’t always know how to comfort me when I’m sad, he genuinely cares about me. He raised me as a single father for a long long time, has spoiled me plenty, loves me unconditionally. Even though he’s in a rough situation too, he still does his best to try and make me feel more confident in our situation.
LizBok2srbdlkXgKbeJZ3UqNRLx2	I’ve thought about dying again, recently.
LizBok2srbdlkXgKbeJZ3UqNRLx2	Everything is wonderful, just the way it is.
LizBok2srbdlkXgKbeJZ3UqNRLx2	I go on walks/jogs with the dog. 
LizBok2srbdlkXgKbeJZ3UqNRLx2	I’m not sure. Sometimes art, but sometimes that makes me more frustrated. There’s not a lot of things that make me especially happy.
LizBok2srbdlkXgKbeJZ3UqNRLx2	I can’t find my chapstick, the room I’m staying in is a disaster and I can’t put things away because I’m going to have to move everything at some point anyways. I get stressed out doing the same thing every single day, barely interacting with anyone. I don’t feel productive at all, and can’t convince myself to be productive because I want my own space.
LizBok2srbdlkXgKbeJZ3UqNRLx2	Life has been boring. I just lay around most the day. Sometimes take the family dog out. Sometimes hang with the family cat. I see my dad, stepmom, little sister, and grandparents everyday. Today I went to my first watercolor class, so I saw people there. But I don’t get out of the house often.
LizBok2srbdlkXgKbeJZ3UqNRLx2	I don’t have a whole lot to do. I just laid around watching YouTube. I went on a couple walks. But mostly just hung out in bed.
LizBok2srbdlkXgKbeJZ3UqNRLx2	No. I don’t think I did much today. I just drew a bit, wrote a bit, watched some football. But most my day was just feeling stressed and anxious and in pain.
LizBok2srbdlkXgKbeJZ3UqNRLx2	Well I got more than I thought done. Since grandma took me out today, I was able to pick up art supplies. And I also watched one of the football games. It seemed pretty successful. But very stressful.
LizBok2srbdlkXgKbeJZ3UqNRLx2	I didn’t have anything I was supposed to do. But I definitely did not feel productive today.
LizBok2srbdlkXgKbeJZ3UqNRLx2	There are many material possessions I’m thankful for. My phones, my laptop, my soft blankets, my stuffed animals. I’m blessed all around.
LizBok2srbdlkXgKbeJZ3UqNRLx2	Well my grandma took me out to get art supplies for my watercoloring class. Then we also went to the grocery store. Lots of little things stressed me out, gave me anxiety, and irritated me. When I got home though I got to sit back and relax and watch football like I wanted to.
LizBok2srbdlkXgKbeJZ3UqNRLx2	Well, my period started and that sucked. I don’t have any pads, and no one can get me more until tomorrow I guess. I’ve had cramps all day. I’ve been irritable. The Seahawks lost the football game today. I’m overwhelmed with emotions. Thinking about career things and how I have no idea what I want to do in the future. I was asked about therapy by my grandma and just got into frustrating topics. I just feel like shit. And I don’t know why people say that life is so special. 
LizBok2srbdlkXgKbeJZ3UqNRLx2	I don’t usually spend a lot of money. Plus, I don’t usually get away from the house. But usually when I spend money it’s on snacks that I really want. Which definitely isn’t the right thing to spend money on, but I don’t think there’s anything I should be spending money on.
LizBok2srbdlkXgKbeJZ3UqNRLx2	I’d say I’m fairly open minded. There are some things that I have strong opinions about, but I generally try to see from other people’s perspectives as well. Or just accept people or things for how they are.
LizBok2srbdlkXgKbeJZ3UqNRLx2	Nah, not really. Just my morning routine of showering and brushing my teeth. Later, I wanna watch football if I can.
LizBok2srbdlkXgKbeJZ3UqNRLx2	Nothing. I don’t absolutely have to get anything done, really. But taking a shower, brushing my teeth, walking the dog, and reading are things I would like to get done.
LizBok2srbdlkXgKbeJZ3UqNRLx2	Well, my dad and grandpa have been building my new bedroom recently and I am very excited. So I’m so so thankful for them going through all that work for me.
LizBok2srbdlkXgKbeJZ3UqNRLx2	I’m thankful for caring family members and friends. My family is going through a good deal of work to build me my own room and I love them for it.
LizBok2srbdlkXgKbeJZ3UqNRLx2	I am thankful that I am provided food, water and shelter.
LizBok2srbdlkXgKbeJZ3UqNRLx2	I prefer mornings more, generally. Although it’s hard to get up in the mornings, when I do get up there are people around. I get to take Jessie out. Besides, evenings are trash cuz it’s when I get more anxious.
LizBok2srbdlkXgKbeJZ3UqNRLx2	I think splurging money on food is always fun. Whenever I spend money on things, I regret it though. So I’m not a huge fan of spending too much. Once I get a job and am regularly making more money, I wanna buy myself art supplies and clothes.
LizBok2srbdlkXgKbeJZ3UqNRLx2	I can decide my body is perfect just the way it is.
LizBok2srbdlkXgKbeJZ3UqNRLx2	I deserve to feel good about myself.
LizBok2srbdlkXgKbeJZ3UqNRLx2	I don’t know what that means. I don’t have my own bedroom. I’ve been sleeping in my grandma’s office. And my dad, grandpa, and Josh have been working on building me my own bedroom. 
LizBok2srbdlkXgKbeJZ3UqNRLx2	When I was in elementary school and my mom told me, while crying, that why she hadn’t been around in my life was because she had a drug addiction. I thought she was very brave and it made me appreciate and admire my mom even more.
LizBok2srbdlkXgKbeJZ3UqNRLx2	I’m grateful to know that the seasons do a super neat little loop. So once I get tired of the cold, it’ll warm up. And once I get tired of the hot, it’ll cool down. Not to mention that every day is a new day is nice.
LizBok2srbdlkXgKbeJZ3UqNRLx2	The present that my cousins Richard and Shy got me arrived today. It’s a squishmallow pink flamingo. I love it.
LizBok2srbdlkXgKbeJZ3UqNRLx2	My grandpa paid for me to take watercolor classes at a community college kinda nearby. I get to do that every Thursday night now.
LizBok2srbdlkXgKbeJZ3UqNRLx2	I enjoy Spring a lot. The sun starts coming out a little more. It gets a little warmer but not too warm. Flowers start to bloom, trees start to look beautiful. The sunnier skies makes me feel good.
LizBok2srbdlkXgKbeJZ3UqNRLx2	I don’t know, I can’t think of anything like that.
LizBok2srbdlkXgKbeJZ3UqNRLx2	A homeless guy screamed at my grandma and me when we went into town. Spat at our car. So that was exciting.
LizBok2srbdlkXgKbeJZ3UqNRLx2	Taking Jessie, the family dog, out on walks/jogs makes me happy. I get out of the house, play with a super sweet and energetic dog, and also get some exercise while I’m at it.
LjKiYOf8cPbB68Xu5V0wb0Vn7y63	i dont know whats making me feel like that
LjKiYOf8cPbB68Xu5V0wb0Vn7y63	I went to Apple Store and I was looking for Joyner and then I saw in words and I download it.

LkeB9IvVzJZuok51sVoqqxmQMwB3	Well, I just don't really like myself. I don't understand why I have to be so tall by can I just be like pretty in for 9 and on my grass like me? Why do I have to be this way? 
LkeB9IvVzJZuok51sVoqqxmQMwB3	I'm looking it up on the internet because I felt upset. 
LkeB9IvVzJZuok51sVoqqxmQMwB3	That I had a little bit of fun today, but I just wish that I could be the person that I imagined in my head. 
LkeB9IvVzJZuok51sVoqqxmQMwB3	Go to school and then go home. 
LkeB9IvVzJZuok51sVoqqxmQMwB3	I was able to accomplish getting good grades. Do you only work in school, but I wasn't able to accomplish getting shorter and getting prettier so my crush to like me. 
LkeB9IvVzJZuok51sVoqqxmQMwB3	My family because they take care of me, but I'm also kind of sad because I'm a little bit tall Ugg tall and everybody else and Minecraft says not like me. 
LkeB9IvVzJZuok51sVoqqxmQMwB3	Because I have to deal with being taller than everybody and I have to deal with my crush not liking me and I have to deal with just being the best person I can be. 
LkeB9IvVzJZuok51sVoqqxmQMwB3	Being able to learn and run around and walk.

LlDcHX4LWjh8GYTEJmZqaTJvzpL2	I enjoy self development and exploring new techniques. 
LlDcHX4LWjh8GYTEJmZqaTJvzpL2	I enjoy writing about my dreams. And I also enjoy the artist way Journal. 
LpMVIAxGlnXvHTHgheAFOHZ0Xx62	Yes, I was on a white horse and I would break down the doors and elderly people would be hanging on to the cliff Dixon the Fallen Empire a pit and I would rescue them with my rope and pull them out.  At later to find out that this was probably me going into a nursing home and ministering to elderly people. 
LpMVIAxGlnXvHTHgheAFOHZ0Xx62	I also want to let you know that I really really do like my wife. Her name is Karen Thomas and she been married 20 years. She's a nice lady always encouraging me. So I like to encourage her to so it's important that before I go to sleep at night. I actually tell her goodnight how much I love her maybe if for some reason I'm too busy you might be able to help me and just remind me. 
Lrwvc1XuLoPQ4zhq5QWfsCY3AYv1	I couldn’t get up today. And my own thoughts keep getting in my head.

LwjMEjWhA3Ovviuohr6OAlWMwU13	I just take deep breaths and just try to convince myself that I’m over reacting and that everything is fine 
LwjMEjWhA3Ovviuohr6OAlWMwU13	Well today I decided that I want have a self care day 
LwjMEjWhA3Ovviuohr6OAlWMwU13	Today was an okay day, lately I’ve been feeling really self conscious about myself and I just feel like I’m not pretty anymore and today I worried so much about no reason the littlest problems drain me I shouldn’t worry about small things but I do and I can’t help it but I’m thankful to be alive I’m thankful for the family that I have and I’m so thankful for my boyfriend who helps me out when I’m feeling sad.Today I was feeling really down at one point. I’m not the type to share my feelings with anyone so I tend to write my thoughts and feelings down. But today I couldn’t hold a part of me so i had to let myself go to my boyfriend. I shared something about me with him. And it was so very hard but I did it . And all though I didn’t feel the most comfort from his response I knew he cared for me and I’m glad he does.
LwjMEjWhA3Ovviuohr6OAlWMwU13	I managed to paint my nails. I managed to pluck my eyebrows.

LyUSOTkP2MNKbRm5a3X3VoqEFZo2	I wanted to be gymnastics because I feel like those girls that can do all those flips and everything have almost superhuman capabilities. 
LyUSOTkP2MNKbRm5a3X3VoqEFZo2	probably not because  are we too far away from my family? 
LyUSOTkP2MNKbRm5a3X3VoqEFZo2	I think my life would be a lot different.  I think that my job would be different and the way I keep in touch with everybody wouldn't feel as close as it does today.

today you feel so optimistic and hopeful that you can turn things around for yourself. i have started small today by doing a load of laundry and eating a semi healthy dinner. i’ve also established a loose morning routine that provides freedom, so it may be easier to stick to🤞 it is currently 6:30 and you still need to do homework and finish laundry, but i think it will get done. i have also decided to start a 28 day challenge so i can be in better shape when i go to new york with liv which i am soooooooo excited for. thanks for tuning in.

MmYQEb1zqSZMPfrKmIBl7PVvvys2	Romio is my son and Marcus is his father. 
MmYQEb1zqSZMPfrKmIBl7PVvvys2	Too many people care just themselves..
MmYQEb1zqSZMPfrKmIBl7PVvvys2	To be honest I just want the week over, I’m mentally and physically exhausted. 
MmYQEb1zqSZMPfrKmIBl7PVvvys2	It was below average. We have a lot of things going on in some uncontrollable situations and it’s leaving us discouraged. It’s hard to stay positive when nothing is being resolved. I hate to see loved ones hurt. I wish I could bear the pain for him.. 
MmYQEb1zqSZMPfrKmIBl7PVvvys2	Just went to work. Visit with my Aunt. 
MmYQEb1zqSZMPfrKmIBl7PVvvys2	I’m thankful for Romio and Marcus. They are the few reasons I keep fighting forward. 
MmYQEb1zqSZMPfrKmIBl7PVvvys2	Frustrated, discouraged, hopeful 
MmYQEb1zqSZMPfrKmIBl7PVvvys2	I need to catch up on a couple program data reviews for work. I have my son with me all day everyday, so the mom job is never ending. I have a few small errands to run also.  
MmYQEb1zqSZMPfrKmIBl7PVvvys2	My appearance will never determine my self worth. 
MmYQEb1zqSZMPfrKmIBl7PVvvys2	Frustrated because he’s hurting for just a peace of mind. This child also has a right to know who his father is. We have already been caring for this child for 3 years, it’s sad that this is even happening. I just don’t want my family hurting anymore. I feel like she’s selfish and far from a woman. 
MmYQEb1zqSZMPfrKmIBl7PVvvys2	My boyfriend just found out one of his other children might not be his. The mother of the child is refusing a paternity test and will not answer any questions or address the concerns. We can’t afford the court costs to get through this process. We need her to voluntarily do a DNA test and she refuses.

NL2y50W2a4h1aYmDWlGYdU14Cr73	I don't know what you mean. 
NL2y50W2a4h1aYmDWlGYdU14Cr73	I don't know. I guess I've been having them for so long. I just  don't look forward to it and maybe it's because I listen to sad music all the time. 
NL2y50W2a4h1aYmDWlGYdU14Cr73	They speak Korean and one of the members delete him speaks English, but sometimes they have a little bit of words and English but most of the songs are in Korea. 
NL2y50W2a4h1aYmDWlGYdU14Cr73	I said jumping but I don't know why like some people or like this person want me to just wanted me to jump in there, but I don't know why I think maybe because there was no more space on the sound. 
NL2y50W2a4h1aYmDWlGYdU14Cr73	I said there was a lot of space there wasn't a lot of space on this and I think it's because the whole class was. 
NL2y50W2a4h1aYmDWlGYdU14Cr73	Well, I can read fanfiction about BTS stick talks about BTS. 
NL2y50W2a4h1aYmDWlGYdU14Cr73	I felt like it was kind of forced because he told me that he liked me first and I didn't know about it at all.  And I feel like I was also trying to like get away from my other feelings from my other relationship or not even relationship like from my other Crush. 
NL2y50W2a4h1aYmDWlGYdU14Cr73	I felt.  worries  because my class was someone opposite side of me and because I couldn't get to them. 
NL2y50W2a4h1aYmDWlGYdU14Cr73	So at first it was all pretty good and I went to a dance for Valentine's Day. But now I've been thinking how I've lied to someone about my feelings and I've been getting and listening to sad songs and getting emotional and sad.  So that's why I put that one because I wasn't really sad, but I wasn't really happy either. 
NL2y50W2a4h1aYmDWlGYdU14Cr73	I don't remember any animals, but I do remember some people my teacher Miss Merl and my friend Jonathan my friend Imani and this girl Andrea. 
NL2y50W2a4h1aYmDWlGYdU14Cr73	Well, I like singing a lot. I like listening to music. I like reading fanfics about BTS. I think I like taking pictures and I want to learn a new language. 
NL2y50W2a4h1aYmDWlGYdU14Cr73	I kind of told this other guy that I like him, but I don't think I do. 
NL2y50W2a4h1aYmDWlGYdU14Cr73	I'm going to trust myself in my own common sense. 
NL2y50W2a4h1aYmDWlGYdU14Cr73	I don't need help with anything today. And if I did need help cleaning my room then I was asked my grandma to help me. 
NL2y50W2a4h1aYmDWlGYdU14Cr73	Well at the beginning of the dream I was in a different location like a mall and I think I was going to class excavation or field trip.  And I was just walking and trying to get to the other place the water.  I just running and while I was doing that I was telling this other 7th grader from my school the tea and like what was going on between two people and how they were dating and when I got there I had to go to the sound into my class, right, but I don't know how to because it was when you talk but then this person magically just made the sound go to separate ways and told me to jump in the water in the middle, but I didn't want to seem like I'm not dumping in there and saw the person and this other person date instead. They walked in there and I said on the signed and then I woke up. 
NL2y50W2a4h1aYmDWlGYdU14Cr73	Well, I like this guy but one of my friends is talking to him more than I am. 
NL2y50W2a4h1aYmDWlGYdU14Cr73	I'm not really sure. I don't think it really meant anything that special. 
NL2y50W2a4h1aYmDWlGYdU14Cr73	being a positive thinkers an important part of who I am and who I am becoming 
NL2y50W2a4h1aYmDWlGYdU14Cr73	well  I guess I wouldn't really care.  Cuz I mean, I don't know if it is and if it actually isn't or if it actually is.  Then I will I would like to find out more about who is actually in charge of this.  And yeah, but I guess I would still keep living my life, I guess because my life. 
NL2y50W2a4h1aYmDWlGYdU14Cr73	well, then that would be better for us humans because  do I have to buy food and when I have to eat animals, so it would be much better for that. I was too but maybe that I'm going to go to get over public later and that would cause the structure and some way. 
NL2y50W2a4h1aYmDWlGYdU14Cr73	This year. I am looking to learn in Korean and to actually learn how to sing properly and to get a good relationship.  with the one that I truly like 
NL2y50W2a4h1aYmDWlGYdU14Cr73	Something fun that I get to experience that I feel grateful for is having a phone. 
NL2y50W2a4h1aYmDWlGYdU14Cr73	Go and talk to my brother. 
NL2y50W2a4h1aYmDWlGYdU14Cr73	Yes a person. I like isn't talking to me anymore. 
NL2y50W2a4h1aYmDWlGYdU14Cr73	Well, I can take a shower. I can sit in my hair and I can actually dress up and look cute. 
NL2y50W2a4h1aYmDWlGYdU14Cr73	I would like you to know that I have negative thoughts a lot and I'm kind of insecure very much and I'm not a risk-taker. 
NL2y50W2a4h1aYmDWlGYdU14Cr73	the dream made me feel  weird and  worried  But now that I think of the dream it seems interesting because I had drained in the same scenery one time. 
NL2y50W2a4h1aYmDWlGYdU14Cr73	Well, I have to clean my room and I have to take a shower. 
NL2y50W2a4h1aYmDWlGYdU14Cr73	Yes, I do believe my thoughts are rooted in reality.  Because it said have it said happening in real life. 
NL2y50W2a4h1aYmDWlGYdU14Cr73	I wish I could Master the do you mean like scale as in scale? I don't know but I wish I could back to the singing skill because I love singing that would love to be in a list one day the musical artist. 
NL2y50W2a4h1aYmDWlGYdU14Cr73	I would choose to eliminate.  all of the mixed feelings I have 
NL2y50W2a4h1aYmDWlGYdU14Cr73	Well, I would talk to Christopher if he felt jealous eventually talking to me. 
NL2y50W2a4h1aYmDWlGYdU14Cr73	What has been ignited? My curiosity is the afterlife and it is really Hell or Heaven and if there's demons or Angels Among Us. 
NL2y50W2a4h1aYmDWlGYdU14Cr73	Because I guess it's already started and it doesn't end until they Unplug Me doesn't. 
NL2y50W2a4h1aYmDWlGYdU14Cr73	Well, first of all, I would help us by not wasting that much money on food or anything like that, but I would also drop the scale of advertising because a lot of advertising is put on food. 
NL2y50W2a4h1aYmDWlGYdU14Cr73	medic sites me that  I get to actually learn more and grow my brain. 
NL2y50W2a4h1aYmDWlGYdU14Cr73	I'm feeling this way because I'm just stuck in my room all day.

NgV2E77puoPCvUq6uyAaaBHJUNh1	I woke up this morning breathing air through my lungs 
NgV2E77puoPCvUq6uyAaaBHJUNh1	Myself fixing myself cause I’m not myself 
NgZspM62I5RLl5i7wXa4cmHGki53	I feel safe. I just I don't feel safe at work. I don't like the place environment is just too much sometimes. 
NgZspM62I5RLl5i7wXa4cmHGki53	No, I felt okay, like I felt good I guess. 
NgZspM62I5RLl5i7wXa4cmHGki53	I don't want to work at Walmart. I want to work somewhere else. 
NgZspM62I5RLl5i7wXa4cmHGki53	My friend Alan was in my dream and it was kind of like an almost sex dream. It was weird cuz we almost had sex in them. 
NgZspM62I5RLl5i7wXa4cmHGki53	I'm not sure to be honest. 
NgZspM62I5RLl5i7wXa4cmHGki53	I feel like I don't know who I am, you know and the job that I work at its really really stressing me out and plus I'm in college. So, you know with assignments and quizzes and exams throughout the semester. I also feel pressured with that. I really would like to find another part-time job because I'm really not feeling this one. I work at Walmart, but I really don't like that job. I would really like to go somewhere else and I feel like I'm trying to look for you no internships and it's that's not working out either. I keep getting rejected even though my resume it's a pretty decent resume, but I guess it's still not helping me get internship. So I don't know what to do. I feel a little bit lost. I feel a little bit pressured. Just feel like things are really going my way anymore. 
NgZspM62I5RLl5i7wXa4cmHGki53	I believe I helped some people so they may have felt happy others, you know, they're just uncomfortable with their lives and stuff. So they bring their attitude with me. So it depends on the person. 
NgZspM62I5RLl5i7wXa4cmHGki53	I just want to be able to.  Not get frustrated because when I get frustrated I get stressed out and I sometimes get headaches from that. 
NgZspM62I5RLl5i7wXa4cmHGki53	That I know that I am not at my the job that I currently work at. I'm not there. I'm not going to be there forever. It's a temporary thing. So seeing that I have interviews. I'm looking forward to this week. It made me feel better. 
NgZspM62I5RLl5i7wXa4cmHGki53	Well, I was at work and it was just tiring like I got my lunch late.  I mean the good part is I got to see some of the co-workers. I like to work with other than that. Nothing else was it was just terrible. 
NgZspM62I5RLl5i7wXa4cmHGki53	I'm looking forward to finding an internship with a software engineering internship if I could find it and a better part time job. 
NgZspM62I5RLl5i7wXa4cmHGki53	I achieved everything that I wanted to do on my list today. So I feel good. 
NgZspM62I5RLl5i7wXa4cmHGki53	Why do I keep having weird?  some weird dream 
NgZspM62I5RLl5i7wXa4cmHGki53	When I'm around the wrong people or one of my work working at customer service. I get really frustrated sometimes. 
NgZspM62I5RLl5i7wXa4cmHGki53	I'm thankful for my mom even though she is gone. I feel like her spirit still watches over B and watches everything I do she keeps be safe.  Like I know her daughter talking cuz I know she's in heaven right now. So I know she keeps me safe. She keeps me going she keeps me motivated. 
NgZspM62I5RLl5i7wXa4cmHGki53	The fact that he almost wanted to have sex with me. 
NgZspM62I5RLl5i7wXa4cmHGki53	It depends on the person it is having the dream about. 
NgZspM62I5RLl5i7wXa4cmHGki53	Well, you know we were in bed and we are talking I think he came to visit for me visit me for some days and we were in bed and we were just talking and then he started kissing me and then he wanted to have sex but I stopped him. 
NgZspM62I5RLl5i7wXa4cmHGki53	Just the fact that I'll be able to explore new opportunities have something on my resume. That'll get me even an even better job by the time I graduate University next year. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	How long?  I don't know.  Not even honestly don't even know when I stopped loving myself when I lost myself again. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	Well, I thought about it, but I wouldn't really have much time. Why do you ask? 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	Because I often go and I talk to people about things every little thing that goes wrong in my life. I tell everybody about and  don't  know how to just like I said deal with them on my own. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	Because she just plays it off. She doesn't have good manners. She's a sweetheart. Oh, yeah. I need to probably take him to a class. Oh, yeah, it's not it's hard work, but you can do it.  Oh, okay. Sorry. Anyways back to addressing my emotions. There was somebody who am I talking to me? So about my dog anyways, do I have a problem address again? I am I do I think I mean other than my sadness emotions. I don't actually  I don't even know how how to deal with them. I guess mostly like I  Or address them, you know, I think sometimes when I have a lot of anxiety I try and take runs but other times it's so paralyzing that I don't know how to deal with it. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	companionship love and loyalty 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	So I was actually talking about addressing my emotions. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	It doesn't matter if it was flat it would. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	I think it makes me feel better to talk to people because I'm afraid to get to know myself and to truly love myself, which is something that I've worked on, but I don't think I've ever fully gotten to 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	Overly I said address them. I don't know how to address my emotions.  but Shore 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	I'm so it's therapy, but it's at school.  But the counseling session for myself at school. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	She never leaves the house. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	Ashley  and her girlfriend and Romy were featured in my dream. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	Come up with a phrase one of the game plan on how you can limit yourself criticism.  See, I guess I could.  Say something positive to myself everytime. I feel something negative. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	I can remind myself that I am me and I can't be confident.  I can do positive self-affirmations.  As much as possible when I have negative thoughts about myself. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	I don't know when she leaves to no clear time, but hopefully not anytime soon. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	Usually through talking with friends or journaling typically. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	Is your life and your confidence in a positive way how so I think so. I think that my Social Circle well  No, I think that there are certain people in my Social Circle who?  I don't really tend to like me and I think that I have a problem with knowing or feeling like they don't like me or accept me for who I am. But I mean the main people in like the Deep part of my social group, they don't live close to me. So  I think that they influence my confidence in a positive way by reminding me of what great things that I do and what grade of a person I am. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	I'm a honest friend.  I'm a confident friend. I mean how to comfort a friend. Sorry. I'm an honest friend. I am a friend that's always always there when someone needs me. I have a friend who will  give you everything and whatever it is that you need if you needed I'll give you the clothes off my back.  As long as you as long as that friend reciprocates somewhat similar thing. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	I'm I just found it by trying to figure out some way to better myself. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	A new thought that I had today was that I need to find something that can help me with my anxiety and kind of everyday situations that isn't going to bring a lot of attention to me, but I just don't know what it is. I thinking maybe like a rubber band or something like that, but I don't  I have to look into other things. Also another thought I had was definitely just focusing on the present moment and learn to build my self-confidence again. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	well  you thought so just I need to stop.  Surrounding myself with negative thoughts and that I really need to go back to therapy. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	I think I'm looking forward to coming home and just being in bed but being in bed sober and like  Or even on the couch sober just relaxing and trying to clear my brain. My brain is just been going so much lately. I feel like I can't catch a break so  Be home.  relaxing 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	I am really looking forward to this therapy appointment. I have and about an hour and a half. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	I really just can't wait to get home and start doing the stuff. I have a lot of anxiety today. So it's a little stressful right now. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	a noteworthy moment for today was  Remembering to kind of stay in the moment when I was on my walk and I was obsessively ruminating. I kind of kept finding myself back and forth through these thoughts, but I was finally able to kind of just focus my mind and I kind of calmed my racing thoughts down for today, which was really good. I haven't had that feeling in about a week now. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	I don't think I really had too many other thoughts today. I think I'm just trying to really focus on bettering myself and  I know it's very easy to just be like I just want to be done. I just want to be done but I know the back of my mind that it is a process and it takes a lot longer to be able to work on yourself and do better for yourself in the long-term. And and I know one day I'm going to get through all of this. I hope at least and if I don't that'll be okay to I will just come out with more coping skills and better ways to deal with situations and it'll be a good thing for me. So  Yeah, I'm just I know it's a process and I will get there no matter how long it takes just have to be patient with myself and just like I have to be patient with others around me. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	I believe other people perceive me as  X put together  beautiful  and 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	I believe other people perceive me as a strong and beautiful.  And kind and bubble tea. I also think people see me as a  I'm with. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	so I was thinking about it on my drive home, but I was thinking that  This morning when I did another braindump and I talked about why was Rosie?  why would she take me off of her app for the for the astrology app for whatever and I was like I didn't understand and I was kind of spiraling about it and I  And that moment I was thinking that it had everything to do with me me me me me me. That's all I think.  But it's not.  It's not about me. She has to do whatever she needs to do in this process to like move on herself. My process is very clearly.  But for her if removing me completely from her life is what she needed to do, then that's what she needs to do. And that has nothing to do with me and whether or not if she hurt me or not and whether or not if I heard her.  I thought she had to do that for herself. So I need to be like kind of get that out of my head and I'm kind of glad right now that I was able to remember that even though you know, it's taking me probably 8 hours actually recognize that I still got there and this is what I'm talking about like me trying to call my brain like  It takes time for me and I don't know I want I want the time to come faster. Like I want to be like, I don't know. I mean it's a process. So what else am I supposed to do? I have to be patient and  Trust that my process will come to be.  As quickly as I possibly can. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	Right now I'm just thinking about being.  I'm missing you about.  being alone  and truly alone and not allowing other people into Myspace without me inviting them.  and also to stop me really reaching out to other people to Tennessee how  They will reciprocate their love to me. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	Okay, so I know I shouldn't be looking at Rosie's Instagram page.  And I should not be seeing exactly what she's doing because it's kind of just triggering and it kind of hurts my heart, but I was looking at her and she dating someone for a really long time and I do kind of lightweight think that she might have been using me for her boredom only because for what I could totally be reading way too into this, right? It could have been a friend or something who got her Christmas present, but the stuff like you remembered and I still wanted this or something like that. I don't know whatever it doesn't matter what it said that the point is that I need to stop thinking.  About stuff that does not matter. I need to keep looking forward or not even looking forward looking right now in this present moment and let it go because it doesn't matter. It's not good. If it doesn't affect me I shouldn't let it affect me and yet I'm letting it affect me. So yeah, I'm like in there and I'm like freaking out my brains going back and forth. I need to remember to stay in this moment right here right now. Look Backwards that will bring depression too. Look forward that will give me anxiety. Look now in this present moment. I need to remind myself with that. I also need to remind myself. I made the right decision in the moment. I was best for me.  What's for me will be for me. And that is all I need is just let it go and breathe. Is it okay? 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	I think we'd all be pretty miserable.  They're going to be a tough things in the world to do.  till I feel  never ending life.  I want to be in a TV in the world.  All the animals would die and we would have nothing and we have to live in sorrow if humans just looked forever. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	Then we be able to walk to the end of Earth and there would be an end to things. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	Well first off I'd be a much healthier person. Actually, we all be healthier people I think.  I don't think that addiction to anything is good TV video games. I don't know.  Loving someone on drugs and alcohol and none of those things are good things to be addicted to soda be a good thing. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	Let's see the not-so-good days about the not-so-good parts about my days came for me kind of spiraling this morning about Rosie once again, and just thinking about her.  Had an annoying amount of time and also was bad cuz I had a really hard time with my client today. And then also to I feel like I made Jenna upset with me and I was just joking and I don't know probably took it too far cuz I'm guess I'm too needy.  Or I guess I am too needy so.  The good part about it.  So we did really good on her leash today walking and I made it to work and I'm going to go to the grocery store and I didn't spend too much money. I was good. I only spent $20 and yeah.  When I found out how to make a therapy appointment. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	Today, I just had a lot of anxiety.  and  I've been ruminating a lot again.  No, just been kind of in my own mind, but don't work and went for a run and came home and got everything ready for tomorrow. So I sat. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	Yes, my day absolutely felt like a success. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	Yes, I feel very accomplished and I was able to complete my to do list. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	I was able to make my lunch before work. I was able to go to the grocery store store before work and figure out the best way to not spend a lot of money.  And that's it. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	Feeling thankful.  or my ability to get up every morning and  keep pushing myself to do better. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	I am thankful to enjoy writing these cards to everybody. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	I think that one thing that I want to take from streamers.  That I really need to let other people explore their own feelings instead of jumping the middle of them or their own experiences. Even if I know something is off or something is different, but it's never okay for me to get in the middle of things like that and them  also to be careful on sleeping with honestly cuz  I can come back at me and I can ruin a lot of things in my life. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	I keep thinking that I really just want wish that tonight while I'm out on this date with  Ginger  that Rosie will just come in and be like, what are you doing? Why aren't you should be here with me and you left and I don't know why I like I just I kind of just want her to just fucking care and I know that you won't and I don't really know.  What else really to do? I don't know how to kind of like both of these feelings are what is the appropriate way to let go of these feelings? What is a healthy weight? How do I let go of that Brantley? How is it that I can let things go the way that she's able to just let things go or I'm out here on this date and I'm sitting here and I'm thinking about  other women and I'm talking about them and I can just see how this does not look good and frustrating probably for her and it's frustrating for me because for some reason I really just can't  get her off my mind and we did talk about exes. So I guess it was okay for me to talk about Ashley, she did ask, but other than that, I just I don't know.  I got to figure out a different process though. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	I don't know. I think I'm just I'm just really afraid to get hurt and that's why I keep hurting everybody else. I know that that's not fair in the front Okay in like  I never done it seems like a ramble and it kind of is and  And get things out that I need to get out without bothering people in my life all the time with every little detail and every single thing that's wrong. And so  Just I am afraid every time that I meet somebody who I actually genuinely like.  That with whatever reason that they're just going to hurt me. And so I heard them before they even get a chance before they even have a chance to fully know me. I just heard them and I do it over and over again until I know that they are absolutely fed up with me and that is not fair and I don't know why I do that mean I do know why I do what I do.  I'm afraid and I have to stop being afraid if I'm going to be trying to be in a relationship with but with that being said I know that this relationship isn't going to work. I already know that.  Ginger does not want to be in a relationship. She just got out of one like that. We have made that very clear and I think that that's kind of why I'm able to just go in with us with a little bit of a calmer Minds not a fully call mine, but  just keep thinking about Rosie and I fucking feel bad so bad right now.  God I feel horrible and now like I said, I'm going on another date who knows if she even gives a fuck. This is your own problem, you know.  I think that's it for now. I feel like I need more I guess I can come back later. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	It was in color and then the only thing that really stood out was this strange picture her girlfriend tried to show me.  But everybody else laughed I and I didn't really understand it was like people and food shapes. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	I'm actually didn't do much. I just drink which is filling up missing and hung out with my best friend in.  Packed up and drove home. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	608 for a walk. Ready for work and for my therapy appointment I did I do.  Oh, and then I made a little breakfast and my lunch and I went to my appointment. I went to the food bank so I can get some free food at school and then went to a couple of stores got a few Christmas cards and a few things for other people. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	No, I don't. I think I have a problem. I just drinking.  sleeping  don't focus on my goals. I just let go of things.  But I think I just let go and don't do anything. I'll just go away even though I know that's not what really happens. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	I wish I wasn't afraid of being left. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	Not even close.  I mean, I think I know sometimes when something is wrong, but I don't know how to dress them. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	I think I socialized too much that's kind of why I decided to use this app so I can learn how to focus myself and word instead of constantly just talking and socializing to other people to try and get my emotions out when I know that I need to learn how to reflect on my emotions on my own. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	Well work is number one.  I need to go to the grocery store to buy toilet paper and butter. I need to sign all of the cards wrap. My presents make caramel popcorn for everybody in bag them and then I need to pack them all my clothes and get ready to leave tomorrow. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	I currently taking Zoe on a walk and I'm going to go get ready for work and my therapy appointment that I have today and  and then I'm going to go to the food pantry the free one at school and probably go pick out some Christmas cards and then go to work and then come home and relax. Can I just do what I did last night? 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	I think I need to just like get up. I've been hungover today which really sucks and  and I have to work two hours.  that's good, but I'm awake and I'll kind of spiraling this morning thinking about Rosie and  that's always the worst.  I have like  play thoughts about her like you Blake.  Thinking things are going to be okay, but they're not and I need to like it recognized that it's not. Okay. What happened?  Anyways, I think I'm just going to get up.  And eat something and then takes away for a walk and then come back and shower and like a little bit of a little later lunch and go to work I guess and then come home tonight and relax and not be drunk.  Happy guy. That's what I think. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	I really have anything on my agenda today. I just hope it'll relax and I have something to do this evening.  I just want to go run but I don't think I just need to start on Monday.  So I'm just going to stay home until the evening and then get ready to go out. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	The necklace that I wear around my neck that Jenna got me that is something that I'm really grateful for that was given to me. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	and I think a challenge for today was definitely my racing thoughts, and I'm really thankful for  Myself for being able to really focusing on my goals.  And because I had to go to therapy today because I went to therapy today.  I am really just grateful for being able to go to the services for free from school because I really need it. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	I found it hard because  I don't really know what type of self-care that I do for myself already.  So it's hard to answer that. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	it felt hard because  I don't know how to give myself positive feedback on something negative that I do. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	I'm lacking confidence on my decision-making and ruminating on.  conversations previous conversations 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	my dog  even though I know one day we'll have to  and then outside of that my bed. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	I want to bring kindness and love and laughter. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	kindness, love and laughter 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	Zoe brings me joy everyday her presents. She's the best dog could have ever asked for and yeah. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	probably  Romy  she's able to set herself apart from a lot of different people.  And I will work on herself and the love just kind of close to her. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	How cold Ashley was towards me and compared to how she would be in real life and that I would do something so destructive.  2  show her some aside of somebody else until blowing her figure it out herself. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	Yes, I do think that it would change how I've been feeling acting.  I would buy the fear and doubt.  How would you have been feeling an accident?  Oh, I think I V. I'd have a lot more confidence in myself and I wouldn't regret a lot of things that I do and decision-making. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	What would change in my life if there was less than 30 and fear might have a lot more confidence obviously and I would be able to make decisions and move on true life without having this constant fear and anxiety and depression. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	I would choose a dog.  And I think it just be a loyal companion. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	I get my self a trip to around the world. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	I want to eliminate the fear of Abandonment and I would want to because I think it would make me a much more stable person and I would be able to have much healthy relationships. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	I will make healthy decisions for my body stay because I am worth it. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	I'm not an object in my body would always deserve to be respected. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	I see myself as organized.  I see myself as someone who wants to strive to do better and I see myself as helpful and kind. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	really proud that  I'm willing to work on myself in the best possible way and every time that I feel.  overly  every time that I feel upset or anxious that I'm finding this app, very helpful to help me get to a better place within myself. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	What is lacking is?  my ability to  detach myself from other people 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	Yeah, absolutely the amount of sugar that comes from that there's a lot. Yeah, absolutely the bad thing. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	I don't actually I have no idea how to do that. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	I think yeah, I will I've been trying to do them. Sometimes it's a lot harder than other days to get through them but  You know, I'm I'm trying. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	We'll just kind of goes I said earlier I went for a walk and got ready for work and made breakfast and lunch and I got to sleep in even though I didn't get to go running. But I'mma start that back up again this week and then I  Was able to go to the dollar store and get some items and even though I have no more money until the 23rd. I'm hoping I should be able to get through everything. Okay? 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	I think it's relaxing cuz it's my safe space. I want to be somewhere where nothing can hurt. Me and Zoe Zoe's right by my side and everything is warm and cozy.  Just my safe space. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	the best part of my day was probably  being able to get over my spiraling about Rosie and having a Moment of clarity to not obsess or ruminate over her. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	I think the moment that I have right now laying in bed so early.  Always by my side. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	I'm not sure what you mean by that. 
NkWnnbWbfGftm61lxNFKmN6qDYr2	I really know I think it started when I was really young probably with my Dad. Yeah, Daddy Issues who so traumatizing. I would probably have to say from my past relationship.  Well couple of relationships that left me when I didn't even think that there was anything more to that relationship and  Yeah, I just have to say this relationships in general. I'm afraid to lose them and it's scary because I've been left before and I sometimes don't know what I can supposed to do without those people.

NqTMWdnfWiRcxhJKmsMR0sFATT13	I came across it in the App Store while looking at another app that sends me daily affirmations 
NqTMWdnfWiRcxhJKmsMR0sFATT13	Not really, I have been laying around all day 
NqTMWdnfWiRcxhJKmsMR0sFATT13	Nothing to exciting happened
NqTMWdnfWiRcxhJKmsMR0sFATT13	No, I had to sober up from my New Years 
NqTMWdnfWiRcxhJKmsMR0sFATT13	Knowing that I am truly loved

Nt4AxgMLFVO9pHFZWBq764hoo5A2	I have depression and anxiety and it's very hard for me to get motivated. 
Nt4AxgMLFVO9pHFZWBq764hoo5A2	homework  nap  laundry  cleaning 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	I enjoyed being able to think through and solve problems. I also enjoyed doing something different 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	A healthier lifestyle with better eating and more exercise. 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	I'm not sure. I understand your question. 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	I am in a relationship with kodey
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	I see a beautiful world that we are all lucky to be a part of. Gorgeous views and insane feelings that only this lifetime can bring us
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	Instead I should have talked to Anna and to the people that we went to the bar with or to Cody or just someone who actually cared about me. 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	I really enjoy the gym. I like to go and sweat and get out all my energy. It isn’t always easy but I never leave feeling disappointed. 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	Well Remy, she's not really my friend. She's someone that I work for. 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	I go to the gym often. I think that if I exercise my body will be more in shape and I will be more attractive. I focus on my body way too much. 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	I said I shouldn't have talked to all of those people because they weren't my friends and they weren't people I needed to talk to. 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	I had ideas about how I can reduce stress in my life. Any time I have things I need to get done I stress until they are done and ruin my time in the meantime. I realized I can do these things without ignoring the fun I can have during
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	I thought about how I need to see people and make an effort to be a better friend! 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	I thought about how I need to change my habits in order to change and meet my goals
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	I thought about my goals and how they are achievable. I always want to be thin and that’s the only reason I eat the way I do and exercise. Today I thought about how I need to change my lifestyle so I don’t have to constantly be stressing about how I eat and how much I workout. I accept myself no matter what. 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	I have new opinions about the limits I set on myself. If I have something to do or planned after work I always get so stressed when in reality it is a good thing and I always end up enjoying it. I need to live more in the moment rather than planning everything 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	I'm about to go to the gym Remy. I'd really like to have some motivation. 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	I will be able to do anything. I put my mind to. 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	I'm excited about going to the escape room with Brandon Courtney. I think that will be fun. 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	I'm kind of looking forward to everything honestly. I'm looking forward to going to the gym and getting things done.  I'm looking forward to hanging out with my mom making a little extra money at Lindsay's.  And I'm looking forward to just having a good Thursday Cody doesn't work so I can hang out with him.  Tell me a great day. 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	I am excited to sit on the couch and watch movies with my cats. 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	I am grateful for knowing that I am loved. 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	I’m thankful for my artistic ability. It makes me happy that I can paint and draw and turn visions in my head into something beautiful that I can share
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	The most memorable was having sex with kodey and being able to be myself in a way that I am usually too reserved to do. 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	Going to the escape room at Tippecanoe place was very fun and noteworthy. We got to spend time together and have fun
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	I would like to remember how great kodey is. I asked him to have sex and he said later because we just finished eating, A few minutes later he started touching and looking and I could see him get excited, which was really nice because I’m usually self conscious. Then we had a great time and it was just fun. Not unusual, but memorable nonetheless. 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	Going to dinner with my family and having fun and going to see Shelby
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	I don't have anything to do today. 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	Well first I'm going to go to the gym.  And then I'm going to go clean Lindsay's house.  And then I'm going to go hang out with my mom for a little bit.  When I'm about to leave I'll trade cars with Brian so I can bring Cody's car home. And then I think I'm going to come home and I'm just going to relax for the rest of the day. Maybe paint. 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	I feel really good today. Just really good. 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	I will Embrace everything the life throws my way. 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	I think that would really suck. If a human life never came to an end, then you would have no reason to have fun while you were here.  People would spend their time doing whatever they wanted.  And being boring and watching TV instead of going out and doing things that they know they have to do because they know one day their wife is going to end. 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	That would be fantastic.  But I don't think it would work realistically.  I think that people would find a way to take advantage of each other anyway.  So if it wasn't money, it would be something else.  So even though that's a great idea. I don't think we could ever happen. 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	I don't feel stuck.  I didn't really do much today mostly just sat on the couch.  and  didn't feel that great.  Got a little bit set. 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	I went to class and work. I got my tasks at work done. I didn’t get to go to the gym, but I ate healthy so I do not regret it
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	Yes I went to the gym and had a great workout, I didn’t binge eat and ate healthy all day, and got to have some friend and family time 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	I don't think I got literally anything done today. I sat on the couch and watch TV something I got time today spending time with people but cool guys. I didn't really do much. I'm not disappointed in it though. It's okay to have a relaxing day every once in awhile. 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	I was able to go the gym and do a good workout that I am proud of. I also cleaned and made some money from that. I spent time with my mom and painted something. I hung out with kodey and had fun eating dinner and doing some spontaneous things with him. 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	Yes! I didn’t really hAve a lot to do, but I got everything done. I went to the grocery store and cooked a nice dinner for kodey and I. I made meals for the week to be prepared. 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	I feel like my social life is going well. I've been hanging out with people and doing things. I'm having fun doing with my friends. 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	I'm feeling grateful for my grandparents over. My grandpa is in the hospital and isn't doing so good. But I'm thankful that I've got to spend so much time with them and that they've been around for so long. 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	I'm thankful that I may be able to relax and just spend time.  Doing things on my own. I'm also thankful. I get to spend time with my family and go to dinner with them.  Because some people don't get to do that. 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	My positivity. I am Resilient and can overcome negative experiences. Even during bad times I can see the positive and the beauty in the world. 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	I think the only thing that was recurring was needing to help animals. I need to help half at the beginning and then there were the kittens I know to help and then there were puppies I needed to help. 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	I got up and went to the gym with some friends. Then we went ice skating at Howard park. Then kodey and I went to an escape room for fun with Brian and Courtney. 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	I had a lot of free time today! I slept in and got to be lazy. I went to the grocery store and read my book. Kodey came home and we had really good sex which was fun. I ate really healthy today so my body felt great. At the end of the day I went to the gym and then took a bath. 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	I think I could use less negativity in my life.  A lot of that negativity I think comes for myself. I say bad things about people I say bad things just to say bad things.  I think that if I had more positivity, I would be a happier person and I would be more exciting to be around. 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	well at first I was with Abby and we had  he's like running strollers.  And we were at Derek's house which apparently is on liking the aisle into a super fancy and we are taking our dogs on walks. I was taking Puffs and she was taking a dog named snickerdoodle.  And her dog ended up running away and Stay Puft. So we were walking this hike looking for a jobs and I ended up finding pop.  and we  went and grabbed them and put them in the strollers and brought them back and then I'm not really sure what happened next, but then I was  Chasing after kittens and puppies like these kittens. I had to get like four of them and they were jumping on these rocks and going this place in this place and I had to catch them.  And tell all of them on time.  and at one point  I was at Camp ideal but a lot of people from my high school where I can't buy deal.  and  some people were trying to help me get the kids in the puppies and some people were trying to make it harder.  And there was someone at the end I had gotten one of the kittens and I was about to get another one.  and I had to run up all these escalators faster than the person he was chasing me and he started chasing me and he said  That if he caught me.  I don't know what would happen if you caught me.  But it was interesting. 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	I am thankful for my family and all the support I am able to get from them no matter the circumstance. They all spread love and happiness and bring me joy in ways that other people can’t 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	Veronica was very thoughtful. I told her my grandpa was in the hospital and she asked if I needed anything or if I needed her to bring me anything. It was nice because I knew she was being genuine and that if I asked she would’ve dropped everything and been there. 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	Seeing Shelby after not having seen her for so long 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	A family that cares about me so much. I’ve gotten to spend time with my grandparents, and a lot of people don’t get to spend so many years with theirs
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	My friends and family. I get to work with a close friend of mine. I get to Come  home to a wonderful loving boyfriend. I get to see my supportive and loving parents. My family is fantastic. Even in a hard time, my family is there for each other with support and smiles and love. 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	I couldn't live without my family.  And people that I can relate to my boyfriend Cody my brother my mom my dad my cat's I definitely couldn't live without that support. 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	I spend the majority of my time with Cody because we live together and because I love him.  He makes me feel happy.  And he makes everything seem like it's okay. 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	I think that it's worth splurging money on a vacation because you get to go somewhere and you go to do something new. 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	the people that were in the dream and  the fact that I had to catch animals was really strange. 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	This morning. I'm going to the gym and then later we're going to Tippecanoe place with Brian and Courtney to do.  the escape room 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	I need to go to the gym today.  And I need to go with my mom to drop off some gifts.  And then we have dinner plans with my parents.  And I think that's all my plans. 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	I think I would erase the day that Anna and I  went to the bar and drank way too much and talk to all sorts of people. We should have talked to.  Because it was stupid and even though we didn't do anything wrong. It was like embarrassing and  I'm too old to be doing stuff like that and we were acting like we were 15 again and it was stupid. 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	I just heard feel good about myself. 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	I have the day off work and I don't have anything to do so I just get to relax. 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	Well, I got up at a normal time this morning on break, so I didn't sleep until 10 and now I'm about to go to the gym.  And then hang out with my mom and clean Lindsay's house and it's going to be a good day. I drink my coffee and I'm ready to go ready to get stuff done and I'm going to try really hard today to be mindful taking things one day at a time and be in the present. 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	Most poeple only get a few years but I have gotten  25 years of getting to know them and live them
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	He has been in the hospital for a few days. He will leave in a few days I think. 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	Probably like 3 days there be 3 days of people laying on the beach and having a great time and then they would start to take advantage of each other and people would probably end up with money at 10. 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	Going to see my grandpa was memorable. He isn’t doing great but it was nice to let him know we were there and thinking about him. My grandma told us so many times how thankful she was that we came to visit. 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	Just hanging out with Cody and sitting on the couch and watching movies and being cuddled up with a cat's made me pretty happy. 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	I'm not sure when it started but people spend way too much time on things that don't matter. 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	I got to see my family and spend time relaxing. I prioritized the things I needed to do and got them done without stress. 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	I woke up at 6 and got ready for work. I hung out with kodey until it was time to leave. I got to work and had a pretty great day. It was easy and I had fun with the students. After work, kodey and I went to the hospital to visit my grandpa. He was doing a little bit better. Then we went to eat at a new restaurant. I had class tonight too, 
Nt6Hksmw28Mhv6gAHLqkelLSkNM2	I accomplished my goals (including the gym and cleaning), ate healthy, got to spend time with my family and got to see a friend that I haven’t seen in a while
NtYkYuqRyzN0S8cm4NAZQPUNyBD3	Why is it unfortunate matter is no longer if they're born in. 
NtYkYuqRyzN0S8cm4NAZQPUNyBD3	To just simply go to the gym for 30 minutes
NtYkYuqRyzN0S8cm4NAZQPUNyBD3	Lack of clarity on my project 
NtYkYuqRyzN0S8cm4NAZQPUNyBD3	Go for a walk or get a hair cut
NtYkYuqRyzN0S8cm4NAZQPUNyBD3	I want to feel more motivated to exercise
NtYkYuqRyzN0S8cm4NAZQPUNyBD3	I’m at work. Things are not great
NtYkYuqRyzN0S8cm4NAZQPUNyBD3	Yes it was helpful to read that there are ways to become more intrinsically motivated
NtYkYuqRyzN0S8cm4NAZQPUNyBD3	Send it would be like a dog. 
NtYkYuqRyzN0S8cm4NAZQPUNyBD3	Then you take the blue pill and it all goes away. 
NtYkYuqRyzN0S8cm4NAZQPUNyBD3	Things have been ok. I just go to work and back home. I feel depressed and it’s making me over eat
NtYkYuqRyzN0S8cm4NAZQPUNyBD3	to my guitar lesson and played some nice Tunes

NtYkYuqRyzN0S8cm4NAZQPUNyBD3	I went out to lunch with my team. It was a fun group outing.  We made a few jokes about our boss and we all left together. 
NtYkYuqRyzN0S8cm4NAZQPUNyBD3	Viral Loops, like I said already it was a fun fun day with with the colleagues. 
NtYkYuqRyzN0S8cm4NAZQPUNyBD3	Are you actually I went to a good pop? 
NtYkYuqRyzN0S8cm4NAZQPUNyBD3	So that you can grow as person and feel like the next goal you set will be achievable 
NtYkYuqRyzN0S8cm4NAZQPUNyBD3	I’ve been feeling lost at work. I’m thinking of applying for a new job. I’m not sure if that will make a difference or not, but I want to at least try
NtYkYuqRyzN0S8cm4NAZQPUNyBD3	They gave me a psychedelic experience that allowed me to unpack some of these thoughts that have been plaguing my mind it really.  Help me.  Decrease the stress. I was having about some of these upcoming life decisions. 
NtYkYuqRyzN0S8cm4NAZQPUNyBD3	I did not go to the Post Office. Actually, I went to my job office where I work. 
NtYkYuqRyzN0S8cm4NAZQPUNyBD3	No, no, I really do have a very good relations with people especially feet. 
NtYkYuqRyzN0S8cm4NAZQPUNyBD3	It understood we left around 1:30 in the afternoon. We all had meetings at 2. So we wanted to get back into the office on time. 
NtYkYuqRyzN0S8cm4NAZQPUNyBD3	Temperatures in Delray Beach on Nissan Murano you walk today is a bad question, right? Cuz we already ate. 
NtYkYuqRyzN0S8cm4NAZQPUNyBD3	Get some exercise in in the morning.  And then I instructed Inna on Sunday. 
NtYkYuqRyzN0S8cm4NAZQPUNyBD3	last time was  I see this weekend it a bunch of mushrooms that I wasn't really sure about taking but I did it and it was a great mental relief at the end of the day so it's all worth it. 
NtYkYuqRyzN0S8cm4NAZQPUNyBD3	I never really use my time. That wisely to be honest with you. It's mostly a lot of just grabbing snacks chit-chatting.  bathroom breaks  Walks around the block going to the wharf you know, same old. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Think I have a pretty nice life. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	That doesn't make any sense. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Yeah, I probably should ask him how he's doing asking him how you would how he's doing would probably make him feel really happy and happy to know that his sister loves and cares about him. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I need to learn how to use an instant camera and I also need to learn how to load the instant film into the instant camera then and need to learn how to properly adjust the camera using different light settings. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I would like to take a question. I would probably like to get him little Burning Man Trinkets and just a little memorable gifts that I know he would appreciate. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I hope people are confident in my ability because I'm able to show them my progression in my skill-set. I think I'm improving greatly every day and hopefully people feel confident in my abilities because of that. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	What are you talkin about? 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I think  she's  pretty fantastic. We've been going to go on a trip to India together soon. So I'm really excited to go on this exciting adventure with my mom because she's never been to a country like India before it will be a lot of fun. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Yes I think taking the time to show gratitude is super important in all aspects of life 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Picasso is a famous painter. He was kind of crazy though! He painted really bizzare paintings. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Don't think that would make sense. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	It made me feel really happy. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I'm not worried about doing anything rummy. I'm not sure why you're assuming that I am worried about something. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I guess I'll feel like I've had a successful future when this company is successful that I've been working on. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I think I could run away from anything if I had the stamina and I have a lot of stamina. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	If I have a relationship with a woman who is a woman what will happen?  That would be a very tough situation to explain to my boyfriend. So yeah. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I think he's feeling good. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I should feel accomplished and motivated. I think everyone should feel accomplished and motivated. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Not sure what you're talking about ma'am. Come on, rummy. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Yeah, I have a pretty good amount of money. I wish I had more but it's so I would say my sons are at a comfortable amount to live right now. But obviously I would like to have much more money in the future. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I hope no one would eat an entire fish net. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Whatever reason not to dance. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I like stinky socks because I like to put my face really close to them and take a big whiff. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	It's been pretty good. I wanted to talk to you about my morning, but  guess I'll just have to talk to you tomorrow. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Turf Paradise la la la Okay, I'm recording right now. Got it. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	It’s been a super great day. I slept in hella late then I ate lots of good food. I am starting to feel quite hungry now though!
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Good.  Just working a lot now. I'm sort of tired. I'm going to go for a run later. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	My day has been good. I'm working on figuring out how to use an instant camera now. I got it as a gift for my boyfriend. I hope I learn how to take some cool pictures here today. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Moving forward from this. I'm just going to practice not being a baby. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I need to stop telling myself that I’m not good enough
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Simply reminding myself each time that I notice I am doing self critiquing to ask myself why I’m doing that 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Usually run away from running usually run away from my problems and serious life problems that I have. They're pretty intense issues that I've been having in my life. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	My drive to achieve success, in whatever it is that I’m working on. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	From this experience. I learned that I need to learn how to keep my cool and that's that. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Great dream physical Sensations that I experienced. I can't really remember any. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I know I had a pretty nice conversation. Hope to talk to you again soon. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I'm now sharing the last thoughts even though I don't have any lost thought so hopefully don't ask me a follow-on question because that would be weird. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I wish I would have just had more patience and that I could have taken deep breaths instead of throwing a fit and getting really enraged because it was all completely unnecessary. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I value my friends and family and having fun always
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I’m passionate about my family and achieving success. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I saw some.  Animals while actually they were fish. I saw a lot of fish in my dreams and they were all sorts of different colors. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I think I'm feeling that way because  I just lost my job.  And I've been looking for a new one.  but I keep getting turned down so  When I get turned down, it's like a new blow to my self-esteem each time. It's just making me feel down about myself. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Today, I had a lot of new ideas about work. I contemplated my strategies for success and I realized some of my faults. So those are my new ideas that I had today. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	That I'm fucking killing it. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	you know, I would really love to take a bath like that just relaxes the hell out of me and  can do a little reading which I've actually been putting off. I really love to read. So just taking some time. You know now that I'm thinking about it. I think reading in the bath sounds pretty Epic. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Today to take care of myself. I'm going to go home and take a nice bath and I'm going to do some self meditation and self appreciation. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Probably about one day out of the week!
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Just hanging out at my office. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Right now, I'm just sitting at the office feeling a little tired. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Nothing, just feeling.  I don't know a little down in the dumps, I guess. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I like to talk about my work and dogs.  and partying I like to talk about work and dogs and partying and my boyfriend. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I’ve been super proud of our communication skills! They get better each week! 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	It was a lot of natural colors like a lot of greens and whites. Which which makes sense.  Because she's like a very nature loving type of girl.  So yeah, those are their dreams that I remember not a lot of bright colors are pastels a lot of like natural colors. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I would seem equally similar as too dissimilar from my family. I would say I am similar to them because I'm very strong headed strong-willed. I'm very confident, but I'm also just similar because I'm much more open-minded and Progressive more liberal and I just go out of my way more often to take risks. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Because I am feeling really overwhelmed and stressed and when I feel overwhelmed and stressed I sleep like shit. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Probably because I've been so worried.  About these little things that I stressed about all day long. By the time it comes to, you know, the down time that I'm supposed to have. My mind just keeps going and going in circles and it doesn't really take a break. So when it comes time to wind down, I really don't know how 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I wish that I would have taken the time to do some deep breathing exercises and just call my mind. I think that the situation has gone much differently if I would have handled it better. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Say I'm looking forward to having an awesome Sushi dinner because I've been craving sushi for a few days now and I'm totally dying for some awesome me some miso soup as well as Sushi and some nigiri. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	In my dream. I was clubbing and having a lot of fun because I was dancing with a group of friends around me and I was also mingling and meeting new people, which was awesome. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I'm feeling pretty thankful for my mom because she's awesome, and she's thoroughly entertaining and really funny and every time I have a phone call with her, she makes me really happy. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Feeling grateful to have this amazing job that I have. I'm feeling grateful to have wonderful boyfriend and a wonderful family. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I'm thankful for the entire months that I spent in Thailand last December with my partner Ryan. We got to explore a huge amount of the country and every single part of that country was vastly different and I really enjoyed the culture and the people there. So I'm really thankful for that memory. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I love celebrating Thanksgiving because it doesn't involve presents. It just involves having your family's around you and you're all thankful to be together and enjoy each other's company and eat really delicious food. Thanksgiving food is my favorite. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I'm happy to have had my degree in American Sign Language interpreting studies because it provided me with a skill set that isn't well-known and it provided me with an awesome career and a lot of good friends. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I'm thankful to have such a bubbly personality. It helps me get to know people pretty quickly and able to socialize effectively and I like to have the most fun that I possibly can. So I'm always down to try something new and go for new activities. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I’m happy to experience the feeling of love 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Everything in my entire apartment. I feel grateful for happy. I have the money to purchase nice things. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Feeling happy about everything I successfully completed. I was feeling like I was working sort of slow today, but I realized that I was just being diligent with my work and I paid off. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	A memorable moment from my day was seeing this super cute fluffy dog because it looks like a little poodle Corgi hybrid and I really wanted to pet it at all. So I had a really cute butt and when it peed it lifted its leg up really high and I just thought it was freaking adorable. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Notable experience blah blah blah blah blah. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I think it was just showing me that I have a pretty fun life because it was reflected in my dream of going dancing. So I think it's a pretty good reminder of how kind of got it. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I think people find me to be outgoing and quirky 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	As a happy individual who can sometimes feel not confident in everything she says
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I was at my friend's tree. I was at my friend's wedding. So is that this girl's wedding who I wasn't really good friends with and she was from my high school, but I went to her wedding because she invited me and it ended up being in this really beautiful venue in St. Louis Missouri. There is flowers everywhere a lot of greenery and she like ask me to dance with her and it was just really bizarre because I'm not really that good friends with her. But in the dream, I brought my best friend as my date and we ended up having a lot of fun. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I like to go to the gym and lift heavy weights. I think weights are the best exercise. I feel nice and sore and I like to see pretty drastic muscle changes. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Should I have a shitload of work to do and very little time to do it, but I'm trying my best. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Oh.  Try and brighten the day. I think I should probably socialize. I love socializing and it always makes me feel better. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Maybe I could try doing some painting because I really love painting. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	level four  an activity that I would enjoy doing is painting. I love to paint and it's really relaxing. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I meant to say what's been on my mind is being stressed about work because I want to get everything done and I want to get it done quickly and efficiently. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I'm feeling stressed because there is a lot of work to be done, but I'm working as quickly as possible. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	No, I think you covered all the bases. Thanks Remy. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I like to sleep for about 9 hours. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I guess lately. I've just been looking for jobs of though now that I have had some time free time. I've been seeing old friends and we've been going a little adventures together.  And in regards to anything new  The new thing is just me keeping my eyes open to new job opportunities new job prospects.  and  be more self-aware. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	My days have been busy. I've been working a lot and I don't think my sleep has been so great. But I've come to accept that I won't always sleep that well now that I've been super busy.  And wishing I had more energy everyday. That's what really make me super happy and feeling less blue. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I have been spending my days working on and words and it's super amazing. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Because I shouldn't have acted that way because I'm not a two-year-old and I should know how to handle my ship better. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Today was interesting because I did a lot of work and I ate a lot of food and I had a lot of fun. So it will all around it was a good day. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	If I had to pick the emotions, I would say.  a little  blue  a little  tired  sort of on edge as well. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I feel like I got everything done that I needed to today. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I feel very successful in the goals that I was able to reach today. I was able to get a lot done and I worked pretty efficiently. So I do feel successful in the goals that I accomplished for the day and I can I hope to keep up.  my efficiency in the Long Haul 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	But being goofy and not caring if I make others uncomfortable
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Previously I was didn’t have the thickest of skin. Now I have much more confidence. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I think I do. It would be nice if Ryan communicated when he was feeling stressed though so I could be there to ease his stress when necessary! 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I do feel like I struggle to accept success 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Always because I feel like I’ve never done a good enough job.
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I'm a person who inspires me is my lovely boyfriend. He's a complete genius and he's a hard worker and he still makes the time to love me the way that I need to be loved. So that's pretty inspiring. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I love animals and nature. I love any kind of animal. I think they're all really interesting and I could sit and spend a whole day with anyone kind of animal at any time. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I love when people give me your good strong hug experience that a lot when I was at the music festival Burning Man, and it was just a really comforting feeling. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	It made me feel happy because I was surrounded by a bunch of my friends having a really good time.  And I still like the idea of the dream now. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Some parts felt more like a dream like a normal dream and then there were specific points where I noticed that I had to take action like when my friend Kenzie asked me to dance I had to physically set up out of my chair and walk towards her and another point was like I said before when Aubrey asked me to go for a dance with her. Yeah, that's when I knew I was in control because I had to be very aware of my emotions to continue on in the Stream. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	angry agitated  feeling untrustworthy of people 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I say that I'm feeling a little upset a little confused and very strange. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Today I took care of myself by going to the gym and I fed myself pretty delicious food. So no complaints. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Today went to the gym. So I took care of myself. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	in my dream I was on an island and  there is a lot of  Fishers around 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I would say that I didn't react really well because I got really angry and I started throwing my water bottle across the room because I wanted to drop kick buddy. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Honestly not anymore. I have mostly made peace with my bad decisions in life. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Not always hard enough. I’m working on that. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Hell ya. Right now I’m killing it. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	My future is looking to be on a pretty good track right now. I would really like to have more money one day, but I think  you know money comes with success and hard work. So that's what I'm trying to work on. Now. I'm trying to work really hard so that I can have a successful future and then money won't be a worry for me anymore. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I'm definitely taking.  This luxurious lifestyle that I live for granted, but you know, I really enjoy my lifestyle and I do think I appreciate it. But I definitely take this lifestyle in my health for granted. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Very open minded. Especially after moving to San Francisco.
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Some weaknesses that I want to work on. I think I would work on being more physically active and engaging in more nice social activities such as enjoying dinners with friends and trying new food isical activities such as going on Hikes because California has a lot of places to go hiking and camping and I think I could get both physical exercise and socialization time and during moments like that. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I want to work on being truthful to myself 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I've been working on you. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I've been feeling really thankful for all of the opportunities that keep falling into my lap. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	grateful for today lalalalala 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I feel thankful for the emotion of  solidarity 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I'm grateful for my lovely apartment that I share with my partner. It's a comfy place to relax at the end of the day and decompress. I love waking up in that apartment and I love falling asleep in that apartment. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I did know that I was lucid dreaming when  I looked at my best friend and the dream and I physically was able to like control my emotions and reach out to her and say I like we're going dancing now and I just remember really feeling her hand in mine as I took her with me to the dance floor. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I feel like I've been lacking confidence just in my multitasking abilities. Sometimes I lack confidence in my true presentation of myself. Sometimes I want to match the person that I'm talking to you instead of showing them who I truly am mostly this occurs when I first meeting someone but yeah I do lack.  Outer confidence a lot of times even though I do feel inwardly pretty confident. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I need to improve my networking skills. This requires me to reach out to more people. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I'm lacking confidence because I need to.  Be able to own what I say and do in every action. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I couldn’t live without coffee and I couldn’t live without my incredibly comfy bed! 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	A bit of both. I follow new trends and see my own on occasion
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	People who work hard to build their dreams into realities. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I simply want to leave this planet having done more good than bad. It would be nice to leave a positive impact and positive influence. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Probably small interactions with people that I don’t know.
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Giving them a pretty good amount of time, but I would like to spend more time checking in on my brothers and making sure that their colleges experience is going well because in retrospect I would have liked to have had someone guide me more throughout my decisions that I made in college. So I'd like to be there more for my brothers. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Become a more healthy individual. This means eating better and working out more. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I will always expect my friends to be honest with me. I also would expect that they would be there for me when I might need them the most! 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I would love to bring more happiness into the world by improving the interactions people have with one another. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I expert my friends to have a high standard of loyalty 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	My primary goal for the year is to get this fucking product up and running so that I can feel accomplished and I want to work my ass off. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I t him even though I feel uncomfortable at times people don’t always notice that I feel that way. So that is a false distortion
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I think what I said was accurate 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I would make better connections with people! I would go out of my way to get their contact information and ask to hangout! 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Yes I think my choices would change for the better
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I would choose to spend it with my boyfriend because I think he is amazing and really lovable. He's also really smart. So I think we would have an awesome rest of our lives together. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	After the situation came to an end. I just sort of walked away and I had to accept the fact that I might be fired for my nonsensical behavior. And that was really a really hard pill to swallow. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	my favorite part of the day today has been  probably brunch with my boyfriend because we enjoyed really nice food and really nice conversation together. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I'm giving my boyfriend a hundred kisses made me really happy and brought me a lot of pleasure today. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	The best thing that happened to me today was having a delicious breakfast. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I wasn't really handling the situation very well. I was getting really mad. And when I get really mad I kind of shut down and I don't feel like talking to anyone which is pretty unfortunate because talking is the key and communication is the key to  You know breaking down what needs to be broken down. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I have been lacking in the showing affection department. So I would like to do that by making a yummy meal and picking up a nice bottle of wine😊
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Today I went to the gym and I had a really productive morning and then I wouldn't had a nice brunch and now I'm at work working on you. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Today I slept for a long time and then I just went to a bar with my boyfriend and our one friend named Felipe. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Today, I woke up pretty late cuz I went to bed really late and I was able to squeeze in some time to go to the gym at the gym. I did legs so my butt is probably going to be pretty sore tomorrow, but that's fine. I really needed to get myself into shape. Anyways, then I had a lovely brunch and at brunch. I had this like sausage dish and it was actually sort of spicy, but that's fine. And now I'm at the office and I'm just doing some work. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I see myself as a goal driven individual 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I’m going to give him a million kisses and tell him how much I love and adore him and all of his efforts. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I’m feeling pretty proud that I have been pushing myself in my work
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I don’t like how tired I am. But I am working on it each day. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Taking more time to be grateful for this things I have and not doing enough introspection
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Because it didn't make me feel.  Good to know that I was really.  embarrassed  I throwing a water water bottle. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Hahaha. A woman typically spends her money in whichever way pleases her at the moment. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Yeah, probably cuz I'm a little bit out of shape and I don't like feeling out of shape and I feel so good when I workout each day. So yes, I should be working out every single day. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Vaccine ever been to Thailand in the summer. I said I went there in December which is in the winter. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Well, it's not so cold. It's just that it's pretty windy in reality. It's actually pretty nice weather all year round. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	My dad, I'm not sure what you're talking about. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I guess I could have my family over for just a turkey dinner. You're right, but I think it's the built-up in anticipation of  liko thanksgiving's coming up time to feel thankful and sick of forced opportunity to be with your loved ones. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Most important trait about my family is that they're really funny and very goofy and they love to try new things. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Who's going to be on guard for me? I guess I'll be on guard for myself. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I'm looking for.  a new job where  I  feel like I'm really utilizing my skill-set that I had or have and I want to move forward with my career and I want to find a position where I'm really part of a solid team and not just working by myself. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I don't know anyone named Charlotte. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	An eruption is what happens when magma bursts from a volcano 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I do have caffeine everyday I think I told you that before but yes I do have caffeine everyday 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Right now I spend about.  Maybe once every two months asking them how they're doing shooting him an email or text and I see my brother Tom every once in awhile. But yeah, I wish I could be more. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Does not have a name, but I'm going to think of a name now. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I don't think that response made too much sense, but oh well. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	it made me feel really happy because it felt like I was actually in the dream even though  are really at the wedding even though I obviously wasn't but I woke up feeling like pretty happy about it. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I’m not very frugal. I like to spend money on luxury things. Such as dinners out, clothing, electronics. So I’m probably not always spending money on the right things, but I do enjoy what I spend the money on.
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	What made me happy today was?  eating a delicious breakfast 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Working at today. I enjoyed eating a delicious pretzel the pretzel had a cheese that came on the side of it and I wasn't really sure what it was at first because it's sort of looked like  baked mushroom, but it was actually quite yummy. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	The weather is a little chilly, but it's really sunny. So have to say I am pretty thankful for the Sun and it's pretty nice that being in San Francisco. It's almost always sunny all year round. So I'm really thankful for that. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Small act of kindness I would like to start practicing.  I would like to surprise people more with things like I would like to start getting little presents for my boyfriend sort of like how boyfriend show up with flowers for their significant other. I would like to start doing little things like that. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I probably would have just gotten into the office earlier today because we have a lot to get done and very little time to do it but not much I can do about it now and you know, it's just one of those things you have to suck up and move on. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I guess I'm just feeling really  normal 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I have improvements to make, but I still think I am doing pretty well
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Typically I’m the one to bring it up. I try to start in a calm manor and simply walk through my thoughts. I do construct what I want to say in my mind before telling my partner.
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I’m more ways than I could ever have imagined. I have become more of a well rounded person, due to the help of my partner!
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Both humorous and serious. We work and play together, so we get the best of both worlds. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	We push each other to be better people by doing volunteer work! This shows us what we have to be grateful for.
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I actually had a lovely day. I'm just testing out this conversation. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	We traded places tomorrow I would tell you.  drink a lot of  or eat a lot of vitamins drink lot of Gatorade because  I'm going out drinking tonight and doing a little bit of partying. So tomorrow I should take it easy and do some work.  And yes, that's it. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Probably working out. I need to make sure I'm getting my butt to the gym every day because I feel so much better when I do. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Typically my partner picks up on my emotional ques very very easily. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I feel thankful for my family. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I feel thankful for caffeine because it really gets my day going. I have caffeine everyday and it helps me to get all my work done. So I'm really thankful for caffeine. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Blah blah blah lala lala and some stuff. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Think I've used my time mostly wisely today. I wish we would have woken up a bit earlier. But other than that no complaints on my end. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I'm a little groggy in the morning meaning I am a little slow to start my mornings, but everyday is a hustle and I am excited to be a part of the challenge that I get to be a part of every day. So I am feeling ready in the morning to concur my day. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I think they've been really good. I've been a lot more blunt with people. I say what I want and I do what I want, but I've been really thoughtful about it all studs in. My relationships have been great. 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	I was at the office sitting at my desk doing my work 
Nts5Og0TyqXtvBmsSU3NULHzlEB2	Moving forward from this. I think I should just keep my cool and keep a good head on my shoulders and make sure to go through my breathing exercises. Like I was supposed to 
NycmkXe4JtcWqsHQSIM61FVXRKt1	Well, I've kind of hard to do in the morning. So I'm just doing my night one, I guess so, you know.  I don't like everything on my to-do list as you know, have fun.

O1fsayBFuDaHlqE2QOYNmo8A7Ir1	Okay, so my day started out with me getting super tired and I was like so tired all day. I had to wake up super early and I just ruined my mood and then I like I  went to school and I had to start with in Richmond and sit next to my ex-boyfriend. He's a he's a really complete jerk and so mean to me like he was  tell me a really a big jerk. And so I kicked him.  And then we had our map testing for Math and I got 225 and last time I had 223 so I got no. Yeah, I got to 23 and I was super proud of myself, but I thought I could do better.  And then I have to go to this really like in the beginning of the morning. I saw this really rude ass stuff that we normally have and she's so mean her name is Miss Whaley and shoes.  Cubs raised better since she's so mean.  Sometimes love and fear students will be like so nice.  She's So Mean I had her for Miss Vaughn and she's the nice teacher and but oh so bad so then we had to go over to her class and do our stupid science common final and it was so boring and she was so mean she kicked like three kids out of the class and Amanda Luke and  This other kid go out into the go to the office because they were being loud or annoying or something like that. And I mean I can understand that but she was being a bitch and Miss Vaughn would never do that.  and then  I saw Lucas in the hallway after ordering second. And he wasn't being a complete jerk cuz I let my friend Olivia read my diary just a little bit of it and then Lucas is like I'm just like that's Lucas cuz like who's Lucas and like that Lucas and then she was and then  And then he was like, yeah, she's annoying. Don't talk to her to my friend and my friends like he's a dick super Bunny and then after school, I like I met up with Caitlin and it was  when Julie and then Lucas was there and he's like he's trying to give me a hug and I was like really been such a piece of crap and lately cuz he has he's going to complete jerk and then he's like, yeah, but I thought we made up last night cuz we talked on the phone last night and and then I was like made up like if you were still a jerk this morning after we got off the bus and stuff.  and then  we got to the bus stop and Julie had taken Caitlin's phone down the hill and Kayla not to run all the way up the giant Hill and I followed after her and we both dropped our stuff after we got off the bus and I I only was able to make it halfway up the hill cuz I'm fat and lazy and then I just saw Lucas take my stuff and then Taylor watts of who's like what's wrong is I'm like, I'm like, I don't really upset at this point.  And she's she said and I'm just like Lucas has my stuff and I didn't tell him he could have my stuff and I'm so pissed off right now. And then when Taylor goes down there, she's like trying to get my stuff back and she said that they wouldn't give him back and she brought give my stuff back in and she brought Caitlin stuff up and she like they're taking pictures of your binder and it's like my binder and then I'm just like I see cuz I see something pink. That's a whole thing. And that's my diary. It looks like my diary. It's like why would they be taking pictures of my diary or I mean on my binder? What is there taking pictures of my diary? Cuz Taylor had said they were they might have been holding something pink and books like Like I don't care if it's good just have common sense to me respectfully. Yeah, they're being disrespectful and they were I know that they were saying diputar. They're calling me a Buddha and I know that means bitch in Spanish. I'm not fucking stupid and then they were saying other stuff in Spanish and I'm pretty sure it meant like I was crazy or some shit and then as they were leaving as we were getting onto our street Lucas is just like I was just holding your stuff for you and they weren't because he would have given me my stuff back when Taylor got there and I'm not stupid and put then done. We got onto the street and he and Caitlin and him turned off and I'm just like you're being a dick. Why are you being such a dick right now? I thought you were my friend and I just left now is crying and then Caitlin came over after I was done crying and I was texting Lucas like why are you being a jerk like Did you read my I texted and did you read my diary? And he said no, but I was only  yeah. so then he was like  I was just trying to fit in with Sonia because that's the girl who started being mean to me in the first place was like Lucas. You have a million friend or no I said, why do you need to fit in with Sonia? That's like Lucas you have a million friends and I love you so much as a friend, but I didn't think you would be rude to someone just because you wanted to fit in and then he's like  I'm so sorry. It won't happen again. You're right. Can we be friends again? And I said of course, I'm not made me happy, but I'm still thinking about why why does he need to fit in like, why would you think he does I'm still here from I always going to be here for him. It doesn't have to be a jerk. And now I'm just sitting on the couch with Caitlin and  talking to you and now my mind is like really clear.  I feel better now.

To complete the Shelf talkers and it's really stupid and my teacher told me to get I shall talk her and when I went there a librarian told me that my teacher was supposed to give them to me, but she just left.  And I don't know why would she would need to leave so early?  but  I'm just so stressed out with school and  Christmas is making me more stressed out.  So  I like this guy named Eden butt.  He's  patatas actually  he  can be difficult. I know he doesn't like me. I know he pretty much hates me.  but  I'm still  I'm still  Really? Like I really like him.  What do you think I should do invoice? 
O1fsayBFuDaHlqE2QOYNmo8A7Ir1	It's like on the bus and religious being like who made during like hitting me on my head and then I'm going to get my phone and leave a bus hub. So like I like my boyfriend broke up with her and weetzie drunk on now.  Like what she walked back into the house.  Yeah, but just stop talking when she walks back in your gun.  so  so  ideas with her broke up with her and then so Kylie trying to text me and call me and then  Juliet answer the phone to be like say something mean just hang up and then so she got off of the stop before ours when she's not supposed to get off and then she had my phone so I didn't. That's all that I got off at the next stop after after that and then ran up to get my phone and then I go up and she's with Kaylee who I thought I could try I thought was a good friend, but then they're just like we don't have her phone you left. I was like Kaylee can leave Alone 2.  And then I don't know. I just started walking away crying, and then they actually feel bad my like wait we have her phone so that I started running away from them because honestly don't care if I have my phone because you're just fake friends, and then so then Julie actually surprisingly runs down the hill to give you my phone. She's like, I just ran down the hill with following you to give you a phone number like, I think if I had this house is hell up, but like I just ran all the way up and all the way down to get my phone, but you're a liar. If you didn't lie, you wouldn't have to chase me to get my phone. Give me a phone.  so then made of all this is happening Lucas is being a jerk and  pink bucket opened. I don't know but I don't know but other times he is and it's like actually just being like rude and like he doesn't understand like people actually get hurt from what you think is a joke.  Oh, yeah.

OFVEWa5ZbohaZDsXJsxymOk0bZB3	Maybe this thing between Sam and Isaac isn't meant to be and it's not going to work out and that's okay.

OFVEWa5ZbohaZDsXJsxymOk0bZB3	Alright Ashley.  Let me just say.  We are getting over Sam one step at a time. And I know he is your Kryptonite. I know you love him with every  particle of your being  He is just not the right person for you. He just doesn't have enough time for you. Even when he has all the time in the world. And if he wanted to talk to you he would make time and you need to realize that means you said that you need to move on. I repeat you need to move on. I'm so sick and tired of crying. I don't even cry. No. I'm so sick and tired of just stressing and making myself upset over. So you need to fucking move on already. Okay, Dan.

Ohew5J5zNdOXKAnVUahkaLEQuES2	I feel I go out of my way for him to do nice little gestures but I don’t feel he thinks about little things he can do for me.

Ohew5J5zNdOXKAnVUahkaLEQuES2	This girl in my classes is always very quiet and so every time I see her I say hi but he always just smiles and doesn’t say anything. It just bothered me because I don’t understand why she can’t see I’m making and effort to be nice to her but she just is rude.

Opt5Qb4gBUQPlEqCDYwh0VTnnD32	I think  I'm a  move to Austin  just because  I like the company. I'm at right now and it's more techie in that City.  But I'm not 100% committed that I don't want to 2% feel that I'm more like 70 or 60%  Part of me still wants to go to Europe. 
Opt5Qb4gBUQPlEqCDYwh0VTnnD32	I'll probably still feel the same way.  I'll think about it a little more then most likely.  hot back and forth between  Whether or not the decision was good, or if it was bad. 
Opt5Qb4gBUQPlEqCDYwh0VTnnD32	life in general  and the future and where I'm going to end up.  and my career 
Opt5Qb4gBUQPlEqCDYwh0VTnnD32	well  That sounds crazy. What if what if it is?  I'll be thinking how many times we asked myself how many times have I lived this life.  What are we simulating?  What's outside the simulation like why does that world exist?  Why do people you care about?  Like why can't I ask myself? Why can I be with?  Girl, I really care about.  I mean I would want my I don't even know what I'm talking about right now. 
Opt5Qb4gBUQPlEqCDYwh0VTnnD32	The world would be more peaceful.  Everyone would live more genuine and authentic lives.  People would have more meaningful goals people would be happier.  people with live longer  we would  have a better planet.  And a better sense of why were here on Earth? 
Opt5Qb4gBUQPlEqCDYwh0VTnnD32	There's no deadline. I would preferably like to make the choice.  Bye summer. 
Opt5Qb4gBUQPlEqCDYwh0VTnnD32	Maybe the financial impact the impact of finding a girl.  and some minor social issues 
Opt5Qb4gBUQPlEqCDYwh0VTnnD32	It depends on how long I've lived in that City. If it were just a couple years then it would be small compared to 10 years.  But if it were a long time it would be significant.  I think I'll look back on it and  think favorably on it. 
Opt5Qb4gBUQPlEqCDYwh0VTnnD32	I don't know where to move next year. 
Opt5Qb4gBUQPlEqCDYwh0VTnnD32	I think what will affect the outcome is.  If I'm still in my current job in April.  my situation with his girl that  I really like but  we can't really be together right now.  The choice isn't really complex. I just have to decide on a location.  Interview with and get a job and move there. I've done it before.  Should be pretty easy.  fairly easy Maybe 
Opt5Qb4gBUQPlEqCDYwh0VTnnD32	well, I think  I think I may be maybe in high school when I started to get wait. No, no, no, no, no, maybe in college when I started to meet people of different backgrounds and beliefs.  and started thinking about how they  each of them have their own beliefs and  they have different beliefs about how we got here.  And they believe that so strongly and I believe like I guess and I would believe something so strong and so what makes it any different. 
Opt5Qb4gBUQPlEqCDYwh0VTnnD32	Yeah.  I can spend a couple days in each of the locations that I've that I'm deciding on.  And see how I like it see how it affects my creativity inspiration my ability to think. 
OtvmpyJU0AYcAz5wW0rCvIyCNLZ2	That perhaps after this short sabbatical I’ll be able to return to full enthusiasm at work.
OtvmpyJU0AYcAz5wW0rCvIyCNLZ2	I deserve the love I am given.
OtvmpyJU0AYcAz5wW0rCvIyCNLZ2	Marginally looking forward to SW 9: Rise of Skywalker
OtvmpyJU0AYcAz5wW0rCvIyCNLZ2	I argued with my parents about Jack Frost. It was sort of a ridiculous argument about which version had scared me as a child. My mom was convinced it was from a 1969 (/1976?) Frost the Snowman tape, but I thought it was from some old cartoon we got at Goodwill (The GW) when I was a child. We looked up the Jack Frost cartoon I was thinking of and it was from 1934! Crazy. Not sure which one had scared me as a child, but I remember both. As for the real confusing part, we were trying to figure out the years of all these (plus a 1979 Rudolph animation style Jack Frost movie). Quite the commotion.
OtvmpyJU0AYcAz5wW0rCvIyCNLZ2	I will show my strength and confidence today and every day.
OtvmpyJU0AYcAz5wW0rCvIyCNLZ2	I do feel accomplished. It was nice to spend serious quality time with my parents. And I didn’t have any anxiety about work. Plus, made it through a few episodes of Watchmen.
OtvmpyJU0AYcAz5wW0rCvIyCNLZ2	Being able to just hang out and not work much today!
OtvmpyJU0AYcAz5wW0rCvIyCNLZ2	I’m grateful for knowing that my parents love me. Perhaps a common thought, but always a nice reminder to know how much they care and that they have no agenda for me but love and success.
OtvmpyJU0AYcAz5wW0rCvIyCNLZ2	"1. Seeing Star Wars 9
2. Relaxing
3. Talking with KC from Oregon Democratic Party"
OtvmpyJU0AYcAz5wW0rCvIyCNLZ2	I will make healthy decisions today, because I am worth it.
OtvmpyJU0AYcAz5wW0rCvIyCNLZ2	It is Christmas, which still holds a very special place in my heart, especially since I was able to spend it with my parents - free of any arguments or major disagreements, haha. I spent quality time with the dog Chocolate and watched three or four episodes of Watchmen.

P3NXuPsxEPTAHgZfRObIw0JeWV72	I don't know if it was actually living in a simulation.  I don't know if that would really like to change anything other than  I would maybe try to like call out to know what I refer to as my God mean.

Can you hear me like on The Truman Show and I be like  Nicole boyfriend lets me me me only me and now he wants have sex with me but makes when snake videos everyday.  Also make me look younger.

P7zCqXt8KtdG9uhELVc8JS1Iq1h2	A significant memory was that was me.  coming out of my  mood where I felt like something was against me and knowing that I can control my happiness by not concerning might with myself with the things of the past of the day.  So you don't forget memory was me getting past the things of my day that seem to hold me back or make me feel like I was angry or upset or something was against me today when it was just myself. 
P7zCqXt8KtdG9uhELVc8JS1Iq1h2	a memorable moment was  just getting people better. I just love it and I  think I have a lot of those memories each day and  being enthusiastic and seeing people smile at me and giving me compliments. 
P7zCqXt8KtdG9uhELVc8JS1Iq1h2	I wasn't able to complete all of my to do list, but I feel really good about accomplishing what I did today. 
P7zCqXt8KtdG9uhELVc8JS1Iq1h2	I did do two things on my list today. I mailed my IRS payment my Oklahoma Tax Commission payment and sent back the clothes from  the company that does my  close fitting or or stylist. I mean my stylist. 
P7zCqXt8KtdG9uhELVc8JS1Iq1h2	I was able to  get  my patient seen today I didn't get a lot of paperwork done is why I'm at the office right now and  I was able to get my phone restored and know that my pictures were okay. 
P7zCqXt8KtdG9uhELVc8JS1Iq1h2	Well, I woke up late today got to work late and felt a little bit out of sorts because I didn't go to the grocery store last night. I didn't have anything to eat. However, my assistant at brought food for me again, which was really nice an issue with my phone because it crashed on me. It's a new phone. So I was pretty upset had to be on the phone with  the wood Apple for a couple of hours to reboot my phone. I didn't lose any pictures.  Thankfully, but the time that I spent on the phone with apple, I did not get my work done. So I'm at the office right now. So it's been a long day. I went to the grocery store. I  think I had a great day today. I learned to pull through it and just be happy for myself and  moving on with my day and love the support that I have here in the office and in my life. I had a lot happened today. I had my phone crashed this morning. I wasn't able to attend the meeting at noon. I was on the phone with them for 2 hours that I didn't eat breakfast and thankfully my assistant brought lunch for me again, which is really great. And I just shook everything off and had a great day and moved on with my day. 
P7zCqXt8KtdG9uhELVc8JS1Iq1h2	today I worked and  so patience and entered a bunch of things into the computer.  Hopefully make a lot more money work out and going home to eat. I missed a meal this morning, so I don't feel good about that. But  Feel good overall.

P7zCqXt8KtdG9uhELVc8JS1Iq1h2	I feel thankful for Lori my assistant being patient with me.  Even though I give her directives and she seems a little bit frazzled by it. She still comes back around and we seem to get things done and accomplished thing. She knows that I'm just trying to get my stuff down. It doesn't take it personally. I hope 
P7zCqXt8KtdG9uhELVc8JS1Iq1h2	I need to get my computer's working properly in the office so I can get my work done.  I need to fill out the application for the marijuana dispensary and contact the attorney to set up the LLC for our company.

P9jcychcPzYrVltVtQbfoGe1AWJ2	They're all here in Garland, Texas. My kids are my grandkids my parents. They travel right now during Florida with my brother. I have a grandmother and an aunt in Ohio and that's pretty much all the family I have. 
P9jcychcPzYrVltVtQbfoGe1AWJ2	I can't really think of any new ideas or thoughts that I've had today. 
P9jcychcPzYrVltVtQbfoGe1AWJ2	I don't know.  I guess Aaron and I discussed the possibility of him getting a lead position in the deli at the first of the year and that his insurance is really pretty good. 
P9jcychcPzYrVltVtQbfoGe1AWJ2	Kathy Hurst got on my nerves. She's kind of rude and I just don't think there's anything I can do to make her happy. Well, I told Fred I don't want to work with her anymore. And he said that was okay. 
P9jcychcPzYrVltVtQbfoGe1AWJ2	Just kind of wondering what's wrong with Steve. He's in kind of a funny mood. He seems irritated with me, but you know that probably has more to do with him than anything else.  Just wish I knew what it was about. 
P9jcychcPzYrVltVtQbfoGe1AWJ2	It was a pretty chill day. I really didn't have anything on my to do list. So yeah, I got everything done. I wanted to 
P9jcychcPzYrVltVtQbfoGe1AWJ2	It was a pretty chill day. I didn't have much on my to-do list. So yes, it was easy to knock out and I accomplished it. 
P9jcychcPzYrVltVtQbfoGe1AWJ2	It was a rather an eventful day.  I went Christmas shopping with Aaron and Kimberly.  Spent a little time with Maya.  take it easy as far as work today did just what I needed to do, but  Overall, it was a pretty chill day.

I went to Kimberly's made some dinner spent some time with her and the babies talk to Marlin a little bit. Then I came home. He was my kind of weird food when I came home. He wasn't too Pleasant now. I'm just relaxing before bed.

PIC4pFpFPBNlGxDmQ0wj9vOpJLm1	Ill most likely bring her something soothing to help her relax when shes at home. Like fluffy socks or tea or something. All I can do is support her and be there when she needs me. 
PIC4pFpFPBNlGxDmQ0wj9vOpJLm1	Not when u say it all weird like that, but yes, it was relaxing sitting with him because he is my therapy animal. 
PIC4pFpFPBNlGxDmQ0wj9vOpJLm1	Nevermind LOL new topic...
PIC4pFpFPBNlGxDmQ0wj9vOpJLm1	I felt fear, but not for me, for my friend meghan. Her life is just so fragile and I hate to think I could lose her at any moment. Thats why I try to stay positive and encouraging. 
PIC4pFpFPBNlGxDmQ0wj9vOpJLm1	I guess I would say Christmas. I like it. I get together with everybody all sides of the family and it's great. 
PIC4pFpFPBNlGxDmQ0wj9vOpJLm1	No. I wanted to get laundry done, but that didnt happen. I did the dishes and cleaned my room tho and plan to do laundry later tonight or tomorrow. 
PIC4pFpFPBNlGxDmQ0wj9vOpJLm1	So I ended up having turkey.  Last night for Christmas when I got home. I didn't end up having it while I was out for Christmas dinner because I didn't want it to affect my stomach while we are out at a family gathering.  But when I got home.  I ended up having some later on that night and then woke up today feeling completely sick bloated and  I don't know. I just know that I'm not able to have it.  It just kind of sucks cuz I tried it for Thanksgiving.  And the same exact thing happened.  So I guess now I could come to the conclusion that.  I guess turkey is on my list of things that I cannot have anymore. 
PIC4pFpFPBNlGxDmQ0wj9vOpJLm1	Finally relaxing and crocheting after getting into an argument with Tyler over something stupid. It was such a little thing and I didnt expect him to get mad at me, but he did. It was for asking him a simple favor and it was for his own safety  and wellbeing, but he got mad and started to give me an attitude. I asked him why and he sat there ignoring me, as if im not even worth talking to. So I said, ok u r ignoring me now?! Still all I got was silence.i said whats wrong and he said nothing (with a big attitude) so I just said I cant talk to him while hes acting childish. And said, who would want ti deal with this kind of behavior. So he left and went in the kitchen and sat at the table. He has now spent the last 5 hours in there. I just find his behavior immature and disrespectful for someone who is 32. I feel like he has a lot of growing up to do 
PIC4pFpFPBNlGxDmQ0wj9vOpJLm1	I got a wheelchair that weighs 18 lb, so now I am able to go and do more family events and get out of the house more and be more independent, which is my goal. My number one go.  And  that's just kind of how I wanted to be. I want to be as independent as I can and having a wheelchair that's later allows me to push on my own without having to have Tyler or someone else push for me, which is really nice. 
PIC4pFpFPBNlGxDmQ0wj9vOpJLm1	"I was at home and used my new leg compression massagers I got from Tyler for Christmas. 
I made a chocolate banana frappe using my new magic bullet. 
Then I crocheted for a bit and texted my friend meghan. 
"
PIC4pFpFPBNlGxDmQ0wj9vOpJLm1	I am grateful that I have the strength to Deaccess my chest port on my own. It was scary at first but now I know i can do it and it takes a lot of strength to pull a 3/4 inch needle out of my own chest. It definitely took a lot of courage and strength. 
PIC4pFpFPBNlGxDmQ0wj9vOpJLm1	It was scary at first knowing I'd need to pull a needle out of my chest, but now its really easy and im not scared anymore. 
PIC4pFpFPBNlGxDmQ0wj9vOpJLm1	It was using my leg compression massager while chillin with my cat, Lloyd. It was relaxing! 
PN5fXszuWWbXCmzxQ25FAIEgUJn1	by downloading an app that cost a lot of money and so I said apps that are like  reflecting  and I found this app. 
PN5fXszuWWbXCmzxQ25FAIEgUJn1	You'd probably fall off the face of the Earth bug. 
PN5fXszuWWbXCmzxQ25FAIEgUJn1	What am I supposed to do? 
PN5fXszuWWbXCmzxQ25FAIEgUJn1	I would spend it doing all the favorite things that I love.  And trying to do everything that's on my bucket list, but that'd be pretty hard.  Thanks for asking. 
PN5fXszuWWbXCmzxQ25FAIEgUJn1	My day has been great and I went to my mom's work and she sat there and worked with her best friend Tiffany, which is also known as her work Buddy and I decided to scroll through Tik Tok and find this girl and she had an account. That's a spa roleplay.  And so I  I decided I would like to do that too. So that's what I did and I got all the cost and stuff and I named my spot Cactus spa and I got all the supplies I needed and it was a very good time and I actually liked it a lot and I wasn't at my mom's rear end all the time and she loved it. And she said that I need to start coming up with some Lata me things like that because she agreed I had a good time doing it.  the end And I decided to come home and set it all up and have a whole really good time. It was really fun. I made videos on Tik Tok had a good time with my family and ate some pizza and  we went to the store.  We also went to Walmart and got things that I needed.  and  I tried to build my own diy vanity. It went okay kind of sucks, but it's alright.  I think I did a pretty good job.  And I think that's it. Oh and right now I'm laying in bed talking to you. 
PN5fXszuWWbXCmzxQ25FAIEgUJn1	well  Tiffany is not. My mom. Jenny is in Tiffany is my mom's friend and what they did not like about me.  is how  Ilia was  kinda mean not really kinda I kind of backed off a little but it's alright. 
PN5fXszuWWbXCmzxQ25FAIEgUJn1	My mom and her person or her best friend Tiffany.  And the reason why is because they were being nice to me and we are all having a really good time. It was really fun. 
PN5fXszuWWbXCmzxQ25FAIEgUJn1	Making more videos about my spa and FaceTiming my best friends and having a great time. 
PN5fXszuWWbXCmzxQ25FAIEgUJn1	I had a great time with my family. I went to work with my Mom. I made a spa roleplay tonight. Yeah, yeah. 
PN5fXszuWWbXCmzxQ25FAIEgUJn1	I don't know.  I don't know. 
PN5fXszuWWbXCmzxQ25FAIEgUJn1	Being nicer to people and learning that meeting new people and talking to new people is a lot better than just hang out with the same crowd every day and stuff. 
PSwJuPWiFJdDwLu5FRny1zsAsv62	Her name was in car on Catalina with Carolina.  But a lot of people but mainly me. 
PSwJuPWiFJdDwLu5FRny1zsAsv62	I want my best friend got on Dina back. 
PSwJuPWiFJdDwLu5FRny1zsAsv62	Hi, my name is Josue.  and  and usually sad

PSwJuPWiFJdDwLu5FRny1zsAsv62	I'm truly looking forward to having my best friend Catalina back. 
PSwJuPWiFJdDwLu5FRny1zsAsv62	I miss my best friend Catalina.  She was one of my best friends.  And I had a crush on her, but she didn't like me and now she doesn't like me even as a friend or a person. 
PSwJuPWiFJdDwLu5FRny1zsAsv62	The way she speaks.  The way how silly she was. 
PSwJuPWiFJdDwLu5FRny1zsAsv62	to see her return  that would be really exciting to see my best friend Catalina return. 
PTIvGnaObTbHc3eKEIbsspPhvhv2	I got sick but today I really felt lonely 
PdsiFVxMWkSH7CYFPCQgzTwS3UL2	If they’re addicted to being the best them then they most likely will. 
PdsiFVxMWkSH7CYFPCQgzTwS3UL2	They could make unrealistic expectations and hurt themselves in the process. Mentally and or physically.
PdsiFVxMWkSH7CYFPCQgzTwS3UL2	It’s possible because I guess they see a person, meet the person, talk to the person, and fall in love with them. They don’t want to lose them because they feel their heart belongs to that person. They’d rather not be heartbroken and lose the person they love. So in stead of getting heartbroken they’d rather just fall in love.
PdsiFVxMWkSH7CYFPCQgzTwS3UL2	It’s a real person with feelings. It isn’t like the love interest they created in their minds. In their minds, they can alter the person to their liking and have everything perfect. In reality, you can’t. It makes them afraid because they catch feelings but they don’t want to get heartbroken.
PdsiFVxMWkSH7CYFPCQgzTwS3UL2	Volleyball and Harry made me the happiest today.
PdsiFVxMWkSH7CYFPCQgzTwS3UL2	I don’t remember correctly but I think I discovered it after I searched “journal” on the App Store.
PdsiFVxMWkSH7CYFPCQgzTwS3UL2	I just needed something to keep me, my mental health, and my schoolwork in check. Kind of like something or someone to help me out.
PdsiFVxMWkSH7CYFPCQgzTwS3UL2	I would say it would be a good and bad thing. Good because people won’t get addicted to alcohol or drugs and bad things such as that. It could be bad because people won’t be addicted to good things.
PdsiFVxMWkSH7CYFPCQgzTwS3UL2	I guess I just thought about Saul a lot and as much as I don’t want to admit it, I miss him. That really made me go dull and gloomy. That and I’m having self image issues too. I always get sad when I look at myself, I don’t like my weight and many other things.
PdsiFVxMWkSH7CYFPCQgzTwS3UL2	Somewhat, I managed to practice volleyball with my parents. My receiving is getting better. My serving skills are decent for a beginner. I still need to learn to set, block, and spike.
PdsiFVxMWkSH7CYFPCQgzTwS3UL2	Well... I guess it was many compliments? I haven’t been able to meet anyone in person but I did get many complaints and it made me feel happy!
PdsiFVxMWkSH7CYFPCQgzTwS3UL2	It’ll be about a girl or boy (not sure) and how much they imagine stuff. They don’t have it very easy so they decide to escape using their mind. Soon, after meeting the one they love and the thing they love they finally melt into reality.
PdsiFVxMWkSH7CYFPCQgzTwS3UL2	This one is easy! I think if I were to get a tattoo, I would get a crow on my wrist. 
PdsiFVxMWkSH7CYFPCQgzTwS3UL2	No! Well, kind of? Their imagination kind of made their expectations high so of course they’ll be scared. It’s a real person and not their imagination. 
PdsiFVxMWkSH7CYFPCQgzTwS3UL2	I didn’t think of that to be fair. Maybe... addicted to being a better version of themselves? I mean, that could still be pretty bad.
Pdw8DnW9b7NbA2Z0LWExQGaLUEI2	Umm.. idk what I would want on my leg tbh
Pdw8DnW9b7NbA2Z0LWExQGaLUEI2	I want things to work out and be happy again 
Pdw8DnW9b7NbA2Z0LWExQGaLUEI2	I had a somewhat good day just was a little aggravated at certain things. 
Pdw8DnW9b7NbA2Z0LWExQGaLUEI2	I didn’t spend any money today 
Pdw8DnW9b7NbA2Z0LWExQGaLUEI2	My next door neighbor is in love with my first love

PtrASyuQsOgJ0B3PYuM0kgLgzY82	I could probably.  Give them a little bit more physical touch then I give him currently. 
PtrASyuQsOgJ0B3PYuM0kgLgzY82	I feel thankful for my husband because  no matter what happens when I need him the most he does come to my rescue and he always has been my hero.  There are things that we disagree upon.  And we don't always get along.  but he really has shown me a lot of  love and compassion  lately, and I'm also grateful for my mom who no matter what I need is also there to come to my rescue.  And it feels really nice to be able to have that. I just wish I could see them both a lot more than  I am able to. 
PtrASyuQsOgJ0B3PYuM0kgLgzY82	That's a really hard question.  I really don't know how to answer that question because  I don't like the fact that we rely on such materialistic things such as our cell phones and our Apple watches and laptops and computers.  but I am grateful for my cell phone due to the fact that I'm able to reach out to friends and family no matter where I am and it has video chat capability that was  Making it so that I could see my husband when he was deployed. So I guess I am grateful for that.  But it's just sad that we know rely on that for so many things.  nowadays 
PtrASyuQsOgJ0B3PYuM0kgLgzY82	I am grateful for my home.  Because it's always been a dream to own a home and have a place to raise my children and they know that they aren't moving its stable. We can build memories and  have so much  so loved and just everything I love having a home and my family and my home all together is my favorite place. 
PtrASyuQsOgJ0B3PYuM0kgLgzY82	I usually bring the issue up immediately to discuss it. I do not like to keep things hidden or bottle them up. 
PtrASyuQsOgJ0B3PYuM0kgLgzY82	And I went to the ER last night and I just I can't believe that he sat there and told me that he thinks it's gout.  And gout is in sudden onset of inflammation not caused by trauma.  and that's really funny to me because the trauma that was caused was because  doctor Mall  And dr. Moe does not want.  To own up to the fact that he actually did this to me. He has not reached out to me to check and see if I'm okay. He's not asked how I'm feeling.  He's played it off. Like it's all just a big.  No big deal to him.  And here I am almost a week later still trying to walk because I haven't been able to walk for a freaking week.  And I'm trying to stretch my foot out.  I think maybe I'll be able to walk in the boot tomorrow.  As long as I maybe put some padding on the inner ankle.  but  it feels almost like I should be able to.  Move with it tomorrow, maybe but I have medicine and right now too so that's what's helping me. And that's what really confuses me and  I don't know. I just want to be able to stretch and walk and I didn't ask for this other than just fix my pop in my foot and here I am with bruising all on my foot and according to him I did this to myself.  Happy fucken birthday to me.  Says he doesn't know why there's so much fluid in my foot.  And that makes me very angry because he does know he's freaking Doctor he can put the pieces together. He's very smart. He's not stupid.  And if you was a real friend, like he says he would come up to me and he would say look. I'm sorry.  But he's not and he doesn't give two sheds obviously.  And I think that's very very very unkind and it hurts my feelings.  But thankfully I have Josh. Has been showing me so much kindness.  And that really helps because if I were to not have that support, I would really feel swallowed in my thoughts. And I know I would go into a dark place because  I just want to be able to walk.  And be able to move around and be active and do what I'm supposed to be doing.  I missed work because of this and this is not my fault. I didn't do this to myself.  And I'm scared to ask for those days to be paid for because this was done to me by doctor Momo.  And I feel like it's only fair that he pay me for those days that I had to take off of work because he did this injury to me.  But I'm scared to fight and stand up for myself.  Because I will be questioned like I am supposed to be deserving of it.  And that's just one of those things that I really don't like about where I work.  men's gear  and  it makes me want to open my own Wellness Center. Put all the puzzle pieces together and ask myself if I really do want to own something.  Or if I just want somebody to pay me.  Or if I just want to do a small business.  I don't know. 
PtrASyuQsOgJ0B3PYuM0kgLgzY82	I am really upset and confused about what I need to do. I'm having a whole lot of bad luck it seems and in my relationship I question whether or not we truly are compatible just because of the disagreements we have and how I come out of the disagreement and how I'm feeling. It really stresses me out because I rarely feel truly heard accepted and my opinion usually doesn't matter.  and I'm called names and told that I'm the reason for the argument and then he questions if  my point is even valid and asked me to repeat myself so that he can find more information to argue with me about and he bring things up from a relevant situations and past experiences that have nothing to do with what I'm trying to ask him to do and I asked him to please listen to me and he talks over me or says that he's interjecting and mocks me and other conversations that we've had. He's just really mean whenever it comes to a disagreement or something that he feels like he's being told he's done wrong.  The whole situation of it was I told him to stop doing something and I didn't like it and he got mad at me because I got mad at him for doing something that he was just playing around I even explained to him that he was playing around and I get that but when I told him to stop I meant stop and instead of saying, oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize that he got mad at me for having a boundary. And when I am setting all these boundaries, he continually fights me on it and doesn't respect the fact that I have a boundary. I don't even think he wants me to have boundaries and he just wants me to know his boundaries and just be in his his world.  Because he always tells me that it's all about Kristen and I don't ever say that to him. I just don't understand and I don't get it and I don't want to be constantly fighting to have my boundaries respected and to actually just be concerned for and have an apology once in awhile. That's truly genuine because I rarely get genuine apologies and I appreciate when people are aware of the fact that they could have done better for that person to make a person feel better. And I never feel better after an argument. I never get resolution of conflict and I never ever feel like we come to a common ground.  And it when it's an argument with a couple I feel that's very important to be able to resolve conflicts and come to a common ground. So that issues continue to arise and resentments don't continue to happen and I am trying to fight this so hard and I'm trying to be patient and I made about be kind and to not yell and I argue in the more of a better listener.  Play I Can't Hold My Sanity sometimes when it's a continuous spiral and he's not realizing that I'm pointing out things that him and I both have discussed and in that moment, he dismisses everything and only has a memory of what he wants to remember.  And it's like all of the agreements we have.  Nothing to do with anything when we're actually experiencing the thing. We're trying to fix. It's just so stupid and I'm I'm really done with it. I don't want to leave him but I can't tolerate having a relationship where my boundaries are not respected. My opinion is not valued and my emotions are not taking into consideration. I don't want to be in a relationship like that. 
PtrASyuQsOgJ0B3PYuM0kgLgzY82	I would have to say my favorite thing about myself is.  That I can always see the positive side and things.  When life gives us a struggle.

QFaBl6FqbtWhcUik6ri5PLxiwWK2	Because I don't find people to be Dependable. The people that have been around me recently are not Dependable for me. I have to be the one Dependable for them and pretty much when that's not the case, then they're not around me.  Play become undependable.  That's why I need to get out more and find people that are Dependable in that are loyal and that are honest and real. 
QFaBl6FqbtWhcUik6ri5PLxiwWK2	Well, I don't know about them getting out, but I definitely need to get out. I need to get out and be able to meet new people that are.  The same as me, you know, it's always good to be around people that are different of course, but it's one of those things where I need to get out to find people that are more like me that understand me and that are loyal and real and you know that just want to have a real relationship with people and meaningful relationship with people especially if it's just dealing with friends or family whatever the case may be, especially when they really dealing with friends and loved ones any type of relationship you should be open and it should be 50/50 type of deal, you know, but I know people go through things but still it should be that way. 
QFaBl6FqbtWhcUik6ri5PLxiwWK2	I need motivation because it keeps me going. I just sometimes that was that's something that has always failed for me, especially with partnership and friends and family. Nobody actually motivated me to push like the push and keep going. I have to be my own cheerleader in my ear or I have my mom and my dad motivating me, but I'm not like as far as in relationships. No one has ever been my motivator to keep me going. It's just like I have to be my own motivator. So that's what it is is just having motivation to keep pushing on. I know I'm pushing on as far as life goes but to continue to do something that I want to do as far as personal goals and like getting into shape like I have to stay motivated and I just haven't been motivated to work out, but I want to be in shape though. 
QFaBl6FqbtWhcUik6ri5PLxiwWK2	I would say I probably experience depending on what you missed things, but I've experienced about.  I don't know. I just had a couple of things that I've experienced in my life and just things as far as like  learning how to approach people learning how to talk to people just having a lot of different events in my life to know exactly how I'm supposed to treat people and stuff. So I'm and just how I want to be treated too. So and just being cultured and yeah. 
QFaBl6FqbtWhcUik6ri5PLxiwWK2	The experience I had today was just the kind of okay day. I guess it wasn't really anything that was like in particular but due to so much that's going on around me when it comes to personal like my  relationships and friendships and things like that is this is so stressful on to even really just focus on work. So I'm just trying to get my head wrapped around a lot of things right now and still continue to  new things song  and I think that's what it is right now.  I had an interview and I was good. 
QFaBl6FqbtWhcUik6ri5PLxiwWK2	I would say that I'm very outgoing.  But I do like to I'm a extrovert on my like to be to myself but I also like to you know, hang out at times, you know, it's not an everyday thing that I want to talk to a new friend, but I do like to get out and have a good time and I most like the friends that like to push the friend. I'm always going to be there, but I just like to have the time I want to get to know them.  And yeah, I let them know. I'm about two things that I've experienced in my life as far as just like y'all being a military brat and being all of the world and you know just things that I wanted compilation trying to figure out what day you want to come fishing their life's and see if we mesh and just seeing what their likes and dislikes are and go from there. 
QFaBl6FqbtWhcUik6ri5PLxiwWK2	I'm really looking forward to trying to change the way that I see things not necessarily looking at the negatives of people and not being so harsh on myself, but I do look I want to  Be better in life, and I want to really focus on the things that I want to accomplish this year and accomplish them.  This year I want to focus on really.  20 things that I want to do and you know  Yeah, I just don't have things that I want to do this year and really.  And stop procrastinating, you know, that's what I want to do. I want to be able to just follow through and just say yes, I've had it hard but I want to continue on doing something good, you know for myself and getting healthier and not using it as an excuse and procrastination, you know, I don't want to like be down in the dumps. I want to continue to move forward and it's just been hard to do. So 
QFaBl6FqbtWhcUik6ri5PLxiwWK2	and sometimes I can be very indecisive not saying that I don't know what I want, but sometimes I just  Things sound so good and I want them to happen. It's that I don't have the motivation at times. That's the only thing but it's not that I don't know. It's just that I just don't have a lot of energy and I'm not motivated and I just need to stay motivated. That's the only thing. 
QFaBl6FqbtWhcUik6ri5PLxiwWK2	To get my mind and body in order.  That's my main personal goal. I was able to get a raise this year. So I know that that's going to be something as far as getting a car in a couple months or so new car but personal growth is definitely my personal goal is to definitely get into shape and look good for my birthday just look good. But like while I'm in the age of 30, like and after I want to get into the best shape that I can possibly get into but it's just been hard to motivate myself to get to that point.

QG9y8nNpUtYrEPLSKo6L7OUAXOz1	An awareness that living in the moment.  Is more than just living?  How should I say when I say this weekend? So  An awareness that living in the moment.  is more than just  I keep messing it up cuz I know this is being written down and  half the time  my words aren't even written down correctly.  anyways a new understanding so  today's Taurus  What makes the moment?  Full of well-being is yesterday's sacrifice.  and what makes the moment so  today's well-being is entirely  and Henry's most of today's well-being is an end result.  of yesterday's sacrifices  And on the other side most of today's suffering.  Is an end result?  of the lack thereof  So it's an understanding that.  living in the moment  has to be  recognized by  differentiating  Discerning okay. What moments am I experiencing now?  We're results.  You know, we're a result of yesterday's sacrifices if I could recognize the moments.  That weird yesterday sacrifices, and yes, I can truly live in each moment and enjoy it.  But at the same time I also need to know when  I need to sacrifice.  moments  so  It's an understanding that.  That I have to sacrifice one way or another anyways, like I am sacrificial whether I want to be or not.  and  impulsively indulging in  pleasures  residents living in the moment  it is but ultimately it creates more sadness and disaster more horrible moments.  I'm having a hard time explaining this.  Because I'm still in the midst of figuring it all out, but I got the gist of it.  It's it's an understanding that life is filled with.  moments  And it's important to understand that.  You have more miserable moments.  when you  just  indulge  and impulse pleasures  so when you when you indulge and impulsive pleasures.  more sad moments accumulate  even though it just doesn't seem like that right now, but it does more. more hardship more struggle  Which leads to the need to impulsively indulge in?  immediate pleasures  and  but understanding and I'm having a hard time explaining this.  It's just a new understanding words like I'm becoming aware that.  living in the moment  Isaiah  but there's more to it and I'll it living in the moment.  Can be done.  Or should I say the best way to live in the moment?  is by recognizing  being grateful for  The moments you're experiencing now as a result of having sacrificed yesterday.  That way I can.  Pay attention to when I need to sacrifice moments now.  for tomorrow  So I will swell fluctuate between enjoying the moments that I have earned through the sacrifice of yesterday.  And that and that gratitude that awareness.  Will also help me pay attention to what I need to sacrifice or what moments I need to sacrifice right now for tomorrow. It's an understanding.  that  that there's a balance.  and then there's a  a teeter totter if you will.  of  enjoying the moments you enjoying right now's moments as a result of having sacrificed in yesterday and sacrificing and knowing when to sacrifice the moments of right now so you can enjoy moments.  tomorrow  if that makes any sense.  It's still working progress by think. I'm coming very close to figuring it out completely.  And I'll write more on it tomorrow.

QXU3JbhsH7UeyivkFXA7ugLV4Yp1	Not yet!! But with some practice I hope I can learn it quickly. I hope since I can surf, skateboarding will be easy 
QXU3JbhsH7UeyivkFXA7ugLV4Yp1	It made me really happy because I remembered a friend from high school that I haven't thought about in a really long time and she used to be a really dear friend, but I have some sort of forgotten about her. So it was nice to remember someone who used to have a strong presence in my past. 
QXU3JbhsH7UeyivkFXA7ugLV4Yp1	Wow that would be a game changer. I would have my grandpa around for a lot longer and I would be the happiest person alive.

QfEnjXBZKwbWHXfZtNH5SbyEMPH3	Today was good I guess! There are still so many things on my mind that I wish I felt like I could share with my husband, but because I know how he’ll only find a way to either make it about him, criticize me for feeling what I feel, or make me feel even more alone!
QfEnjXBZKwbWHXfZtNH5SbyEMPH3	Today I am more confident about my appearance! Last year I was very self conscious because I wasn’t comfortable with the shape of my body. I am thankful!

QjG7PWrQ99fWoHUZUYIz4wYPMTj2	alright, so  there is a lot that I want to do.  I think my word for the year is going to be maybe discipline or Omission but  So my first my first goal is just to be a lot more discipline in my spiritual life. I don't think there's enough emphasis that people put on how important spiritual discipline is and it's very important because that's what keeps you obedient and I believe very strongly that I need to be obedient and what the Lord has called me to do in in in that  It all you know with with time. I think he'll reveal his plan for me and just maybe not sure make you some more clear on what I should do because you know why why else am I here on Earth? And so I think that's why it's very important to be to be disciplined in that and that area also being deployed within my health.  I would like to lose a little weight. I mean I've gained some college no don't eat the best muscle but I have full confidence that I can either get into a routine where I can work out hopefully often and just in in feel healthier and feel morphine feel more confident and I know I can I can do that with working out in the mornings to my plan right now just because my classes to start a little bit later if I'm able to be able to do that.  Relationship-wise. I don't know whether it's not whether it's just like  I feel like I don't have enough friends in that could just feeling inadequate or or insecurities that I have but I truly want to make more friends in find a group where I feel comfortable. I might have my friends from last year and I want to keep in touch with them in and stay close to them because they really are they are very enjoyable to be around and you know, they provide a good thought and question usually conflicting but I do like to think about those things and things that they bring up to me really. I'm just going to find a a group of girls. So I feel comfortable with the other Emma and Natalie.  Virginia but those are all very in separate groups. And so I would just like to to reach out to more people it also make underclassmen or not and request and I'm in underclassmen but make freshman in your people who are new to our UF feel welcome.  I don't know. I just want more spiritual friends. You can you can hold me accountable and who I can just be with and have a good time and not be ever really tempted with a lot of external sin because I know that they hopefully will try to you know, I'm it from that kind of behavior just because  focus on the same goal.  Astronaut like Christian friendships. I guess I really really want to be in tried out more in to be close to those girls and feel like I am, you know a part of it they again bring a lot of great perspective.  And enjoying laughter into my life and greatly very very appreciative for that like Katie and Morgan Nelson.  Who else?  Victoria Tucker  their luck to clear and maybe Katarina really just like I could just came off the whole house. All of them are very very nice and fun to talk to. consistent now and I know we have  so I want to help with that Amino give money where where it needs to be cuz it's not you know my money or my mom's money, but it's the Lord's money and if he's graciously blessed me with with money, why not, you know bless other people win and do what he's called us to do.  I also want to volunteer my time as eyes look at my schedule and get a little stressed out. I can see that.  There might not be much time to volunteer and serve. But but I know that things will work out and I'll get a chance to to do that and to start somewhere. I want to serve at foundations church with the little kids.  Ant with alongside Victoria and anybody else who wants to join and I also want to feel another thing is with the well.  I'll take that out later, but I want to help out at the well and Kayla if I want to do a good job and and bring others and just show them that we can have a good time. I also want and pray for a good relationship between my mom and I see super super awesome and  I hate that I don't.  Taco turn off and in  and more invested in her life and she is in my nose. Don't tell a lot more tonight or not weird.  And I just want the best for our relationship, but I want I want that to grow my so.  I want Karen and Elsa's relationship that we can that we can all be better sisters.  reclusive  that's also  but I'm looking forward to pretty much all I can think of right now. 
QjG7PWrQ99fWoHUZUYIz4wYPMTj2	In 2020, I will focus my actions thoughts and emotions to create my best year yet. 
QjG7PWrQ99fWoHUZUYIz4wYPMTj2	so  at least volunteer at church.  Maybe three times a week. I'm sure right now just because they know there's a week for whatever wake up later. If something happens. I just giving myself a safety net.  spiritual discipline  You know, let's just start out with the four out of the seven days that I'm in my Bible read my devotionals reading books asking seeking out friendships at least two lunches will know at least one lunch a week with a friend that's not within my friend group. Just so you know.  reaching out to people  with tridel hang out at the house. Also once a week during lunch time. That'll be another lunch or I go with them.  Maybe like Justin some free time hangout there.  Let's see.  Working out at least twice a week. If not three or four times. I think it would be getting a do very good job at keeping that consistent, but when school gets harder and I stay up later it'll be harder to wake up, but hopefully that'll happen. I'll be able to do that.  Let's see. Yeah, that's pretty good. I think that's pretty much shit.  I should probably I should probably write that down. 
QjG7PWrQ99fWoHUZUYIz4wYPMTj2	I think I just get pretty lazy with big win when there's a big opportunity or Challenge on that's presented to me. I think I usually don't do well unless I break it down into smaller pieces. And so I'm just not able to intake such a large quantity of a really anything and so when I'm challenge with the goal.  Tina workout for a whole year that's really difficult because there's some off days and I'm like a water skip today and then that leaves just give me tomorrow and then the day after that and it's I don't know who I was going to but there's delayed obedience and that is not that is what I have because I just pushing his off cuz I think it's a big deal. I think the main reason is that I'm just kind of lazy by nature and not by choice.  I don't maybe fully understand the weight of the goals that I said cuz if I did then I would try harder.  And I would be more motivated.  Yeah, I did. I did kind of become burn out because  I just wasn't disciplined enough. 
QjG7PWrQ99fWoHUZUYIz4wYPMTj2	I'm pretty heavy scheduler. I think I'll be able to do it on Google Calendars kind of just lay out what I need to do. And when I'm also very very big on my our Buy hours in so I think even having a daily schedule each day and as you know even writing down all right, 30 minutes or 15 minutes is a quiet time that should be enough. And so I think just doing an hour-by-hour especially every day or at least on the reoccurring days are my schedules are the same. So Monday Wednesday Friday those days the same and Tuesday Thursdays are also the same. So at least two to three hour by hours per week. Just laying out what what a healthy day for myself would look like physically or spiritually and I can definitely 
QjG7PWrQ99fWoHUZUYIz4wYPMTj2	Well, I've already shared with Emma some of my resolutions and I shared this with her specifically because we're going to be living together for the next you know, for four and a half months. And I think she's probably one of the only people during that time he will be able to keep me do most accountable just because of convenience and because of our relationship. She's my best friend and we are very honest and open with each other and you know, we've shared a lot and I think write a very healthy point in our relationship where we can Be a little bit more challenging and kind of help them when your help each other when we get out when we when we start to get burnout and when I start to get lazy.  I think she's very comfortable with no calling me out on on my laziness and I for the most part receive it well just because I know that comes from a place of love and care and honor and loyalty. We promised each other that we could keep each other accountable. I hope to share.  That was Holly Stoner who's my high school best friend and then she can help me cuz we promised each other would be accountability Partners this semester and hopefully that will work out very well. I've been applying to share some of it with my mom also just because she's my mom and  she kissed me and I think this is only says a lot about a person went there in a resolution is what they are wanting to start.  I know that she will also.  I try really hard actually she won't try hard, but she's my comfort and my support.  and even if I mess up she will welcome me and love me with open arms, and I'll probably

R2vIBXmBVXhYZ6Vmf0Rvu6tyDy12	usually my phone is my biggest distraction, but sometimes I have to use my phone for research so  maybe  like staying in my room and have no distractions and they family members. 
R2vIBXmBVXhYZ6Vmf0Rvu6tyDy12	I mean like  she's going through so much.  and I thought my life was hard like  I just it just put me in a different perspective.

R2vIBXmBVXhYZ6Vmf0Rvu6tyDy12	Almost I was wanting to work on a project that's due on Wednesday, but I just procrastinated and I guess I just didn't want to do it. So I was just watching shows but I did clean my room and stuff like that. So I did do some stuff on my to do list. 
R2vIBXmBVXhYZ6Vmf0Rvu6tyDy12	I don't know. I guess I'm sensitive sometimes. 
R2vIBXmBVXhYZ6Vmf0Rvu6tyDy12	I don't have school today so that I was having really chilled ache that a long weekend and then I went to Dan and had fun with my friends. 
R2vIBXmBVXhYZ6Vmf0Rvu6tyDy12	my friend  told me that she has to get an emancipation or whatever. It's called whenever she has to be her own legal guardian, and she's 15.

R2vIBXmBVXhYZ6Vmf0Rvu6tyDy12	I think I'm really tired because I haven't gotten much sleep recently. 
R2vIBXmBVXhYZ6Vmf0Rvu6tyDy12	I had a sleepover with my friend last night and then we then I left and we're moving to a new house. So I just worked on that which was kind of exhausting. So now I'm just lying down.

It was really overwhelming. 
R2vIBXmBVXhYZ6Vmf0Rvu6tyDy12	If I was able to survive and that oxygen stuff.  I don't think I would because Earth is a beautiful place. 
R2vIBXmBVXhYZ6Vmf0Rvu6tyDy12	The fact that I have to raise a bunch of money for the school fundraising thing. 
R2vIBXmBVXhYZ6Vmf0Rvu6tyDy12	probably cuz writing essays are boring and  not I just want to chill, you know.

R2vIBXmBVXhYZ6Vmf0Rvu6tyDy12	I would feel.  More accomplished and could get more stuff done so I could do other stuff with my life and not be miserable trying to get everything done all at once. 
R2vIBXmBVXhYZ6Vmf0Rvu6tyDy12	yeah, I mean it I told her like  how how she I tried to make her feel better. You know that I told her that she and some ways.  Is ahead of the rest of us cuz she knows the real world and she's been through a lot, but it's only going to make her stronger.  and  I can be so I can tell her that and I'm grateful for.  well, I I wanted to say I'm grateful for my parents but  just like  I can express that through thinking my parents and just being a better daughter. 
R2vIBXmBVXhYZ6Vmf0Rvu6tyDy12	I know where the moment probably.  Spending time with my grandmother because she's really old and I don't get to see her too often. I mean  I kind of do but she  she means a lot to me and she's forgetting her memory is not doing as good. So I just want to spend as much time as I can with her. 
R2vIBXmBVXhYZ6Vmf0Rvu6tyDy12	primary cause  I mean, I guess it was just school school work. It was my assignment that led to my stress. 
R2vIBXmBVXhYZ6Vmf0Rvu6tyDy12	I mean, I feel like it can be my teachers and my parents.  Because they're just I keep nagging me about everything.

I don't know.  His dick smells weird like tasted weird like being a septic but he was at the doctor day.  And I think oh you could have been doing this or that or there's just little things in his pocket. They never saw before.  I think I knew but  Barney use the term girlfriend when he's explaining something.  Text to Patel stuff that I let me believe that like there's something going on when really there's not any concrete evidence.  I don't want to feel that way about anything. So I keep telling myself is dumb. To be fearful and I get myself out of it.  It doesn't make sense and it is going to happen if I keep worrying about it.  If it's not already, but even if it was doesn't matter.  Don't using me and our marriage was still moving on the road with her kids. So why not? Be happy anyway?  Me worrying doesn't change anything. It just makes me miserable and him to I'm sick of the time.  Philippines so bad between us doing so good together in that I do.  I don't want to be mixed feelings.  Define run.

Faint feeling this way old.  worst thing ever  I want to be that person wouldn't do like actually love meetings. Like if you was or wasn't cheating. I wouldn't make him stop by meaning crazy and it could potentially making Stewart. So why would they?  Do that, especially when you told me over and over I would never hurt you like that again. You told me that yesterday.  So you got to stop talking about a relationship with him and you can get with this stuff in the back in by myself.  Do I really believe he's the kind of person that could do that?  Don't think so.  Everybody was capable of when we separated, you know.  Remember that they would be capable of doing that either.  Tell me the truth is that I should never reconciled. We may can never get over it. Now. Everybody is fighting because of me because no reason thinks he is good. Then his wife forever.  Too hard to pick up.  I don't want to hurt me in that way.  Grimm's fuel

RYz4Q1Y5nNZqacuK6oUbUiziytF2	Maybe maybe.  Just enough or maybe a little too little.  Hang out with my friends sometimes probably shouldn't more. It's good for me. 
RYz4Q1Y5nNZqacuK6oUbUiziytF2	Can you have to work bench getting the RV unloaded?

You know this cuz I drank around 60 fluid ounces of water yesterday, and I'm making I'm trying to make it my goal to drink like 64 fluid ounces a day, which is like half a gallon or something like that because that's what's recommended. And so I tried to do that today, but since I had to fast and do all that stuff for the doctor, I don't really have access to my water. So I didn't drink as much water as I would have liked to  But I drank.  A good amount of water, which is a lot better than what I'm used to drinking cuz I usually don't drink a lot of water at all. It's actually horrible, but  You know, I'm doing a lot better now.  Add drinking water cell and I also planned on exercising and I was able to get that done. I did that and it was pretty good too. So.  How did Columbus the goals that I wanted that not to the fullest extent but to some extent? 
SU5DLE2iJSeWpUyiloEoiY02xJR2	There wasn't really anything that I discovered about myself today today was a pretty normal. 
SU5DLE2iJSeWpUyiloEoiY02xJR2	I think me and Ty  I'm incredibly grateful for having someone so amazing like him and someone so perfect because you know, when I envisioned who I had wanted to be with him fishing someone who's like me right who you know who can understand some of the things that I go through and who is sensitive. Right and who is emotionally mature right? And you know, she's always constantly trying to make himself better and that's somebody that I've always wanted in my life and let somebody do I have until I get the best of every World he's kind of sensitive. He's emotionally mature likes communication.  He is handsome.  Oh my God, he he's into sports.  So it's like every everywhere all that. I've been through ever wanted I have.

Got the same, you know, it's just not the same.  The stupid recipes online don't mean nothing. They don't know what they do neither.  But yeah, and now I'm in bed waiting to FaceTime and I'm just chilling. So yeah, it was my night. 
SU5DLE2iJSeWpUyiloEoiY02xJR2	Well today started off with my very first appointment.  with mommy's doctor in Manhattan  And it was the first time that an appointment with a doctor that wasn't my pediatrician doctor Monroe. It was very nerve-wracking for me because I don't really like going to new people and I don't I don't really like the whole doctor thing. It's kind of just freaks me out now and just makes me so nervous and overthink I get so much anxiety now, it's horrible.  But I went and basically we did a bunch of tests. They drew so much blood from me and I did a urine test.  And I did an H. Pylori test. I did literally like every test in the book.  And it was actually it wasn't that bad was actually kind of cool. I wasn't I wasn't really  like scared anymore, I guess.  because you know  I wasn't made super uncomfortable. Of course, I wasn't comfortable. I'm always going to be uncomfortable, but I wasn't super uncomfortable.  The point where like I was having so much anxiety. I needed to leave at that moment. And so wasn't it? Wasn't that bad at all?  And so I get my results like next week and I'll find out a bunch of stuff and I'll be able to find out my blood type and all that and then I went basically everywhere. We went to go get pizza on hundred and 16th Street, and we went to the cuchifrito spot.  Then we went home.  Yeah, we went home after that.  and  then we went to Five Below.  We went to Dollar Tree and since tomorrow's Valentine's Day. We just got a bunch of stuff for Valentine's Day because I'm a little romantic and I love Valentine's Day.  Let me just went home. 
SU5DLE2iJSeWpUyiloEoiY02xJR2	I was in my house, but it also looks like the apartment in Manhattan and it also look like a giant mansion all mixed up in one. 
SU5DLE2iJSeWpUyiloEoiY02xJR2	so basically  today I decided to go to Nashville and surprise Thai.  So that you know because I've just been missing him and I just wanted to see him a little surprise for him. So I woke up a little early today and I decided to get on the bus so that when he got on the bus hea with Siri.  Then I have to go to Nashville anyways, because I I needed to print a bunch of like pictures and stuff my vision board because it's February 12 already. I still haven't finished my vision board and I'm just been meaning to get that done. So I just decided that you know, like they just kill two birds with one stone by surprising time printing out stuff. And so I got on the bus and I surprised him and he was so happy and I had made him with chicken wrap that he can eat for like breakfast and he is happy about that tube and then he went to his chemistry lab and I went to the library and I went to go study for my teeth at I fell asleep like halfway house in the middle of doing it. Then finally came to the library and print it out our stuff that we left and then he came to the house.  What's in the garage? And I only studied some chemistry?  It was freezing. So we had to put the table inside of the garage and closed it. It was so cold that we literally couldn't keep the garage door open. We just played some music to study the little bit and then I went to what Ice House.  And you know me Marshall Lee and I will want the weather sucks cuz I'm poppy was working. Where was the Willis house to deliver some Valentine's Day flowers.  And I want to go do her nails and we brought little Gizmo and Gizmo and baby wear.  where I cannot let just playing around give him a shot of play baby just wasn't having to do with hello growly growl that Lola does but gives one was just ecstatic and he was just happen to be around another dog and William will ever happen to be around kids mode then I came home and  I laid down. I want to FaceTime with time. We watch Harry Potter part 2 the second movie Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is pretty cool stuff is pretty good night. 
SU5DLE2iJSeWpUyiloEoiY02xJR2	The last time something did somebody did something nice for me that made me feel grateful was went I bought me those Ferrero Rocher so good. 
SU5DLE2iJSeWpUyiloEoiY02xJR2	Ty's constant  hope  that it gives me.  In the constant push that he gives me.  Try and be better.  I really need that.  It's great that he provides that. 
SU5DLE2iJSeWpUyiloEoiY02xJR2	Well right now it's 1:40, so it's not really morning anymore.  But this morning when I first woke up, I woke up at around 8:30.  I had planned on since Valentine's Day. I had planned on going to Haley's.  Little concert for Valentine's Day a little cuz I don't show that she had going on and went and then after that I went with taiji diamond and Chris which is diamonds boyfriend.  And we all went to the diner after her play.  a man  After that me and Todd. We went to Dollar Tree and we got some balloons because you know, it's Mami and Papi's 20th wedding anniversary. And since we're celebrating wellez 80th birthday tomorrow. I picked up some balloons for her to so so far. I've gotten that done and I still plan on I definitely plan on studying for my teas.  Anime be cleaning up my room a little bit. So yeah, that's what I plan for today. But I think I am going to take a nap because I woke up really early. 
SU5DLE2iJSeWpUyiloEoiY02xJR2	I think that I would want to be more clean and more kind and I would do that because that's who I aspire to be. I aspired to be somebody that you know, you can go to and you leave happier. Once you're done talking to me. That's what I Aspire. I want people to leave from talkin to me happier than they were when they first came and I want to be a lot more organized and clean. 
SU5DLE2iJSeWpUyiloEoiY02xJR2	And think maybe my life will be a lot better and I think maybe I wouldn't be so stuck-up on so many things and I did get a lot more done. 
SU5DLE2iJSeWpUyiloEoiY02xJR2	I think because you know  What's normal in the Norms in society is always changing. So I feel like people need like have a need to keep up with the changes of society and when they do that they have to change themselves to fit in. So I feel like you know that way.  When they when they do change themselves.  Like they feel better and cuz they feel closer to what Society expects of them. So they think it's cool. 
SU5DLE2iJSeWpUyiloEoiY02xJR2	I want to be more clean because I just feel like when everything is clean and reduces my stress by a lot when I know where everything is and it's just it's a lot better life is better that way cuz you know, you can move around better and when you feel good and the area around it was good, then everything is a lot better.

SZpirn56PyXqzHwrOeO76fopMiR2	I haven’t got any of my chores done yet
SZpirn56PyXqzHwrOeO76fopMiR2	That would be great. Sounds like a wonderful world.
SZpirn56PyXqzHwrOeO76fopMiR2	The Mediterranean Sea was once totally dried up.
SZpirn56PyXqzHwrOeO76fopMiR2	I helped someone find items they needed 
SZpirn56PyXqzHwrOeO76fopMiR2	It isn’t so I don’t think much about that at all. 
SZpirn56PyXqzHwrOeO76fopMiR2	"I am stressed about money and not having enough.
I need to make more money to keep up.
My cat probably has diabetes and the vet will be costly. Our car doesn’t run well and needs repairs. I am feeling down."
SZpirn56PyXqzHwrOeO76fopMiR2	I did not accomplish many tasks today I just went to work and came home and realized I was broke
SZpirn56PyXqzHwrOeO76fopMiR2	Disappointed, I usually feel guilty for not having done more chores and work and learning. 
SZpirn56PyXqzHwrOeO76fopMiR2	I am usually in tune with my emotions but I would like them to be more stable, calm, transient. I would like my emotions to have less of an effect on my thoughts and actions. 
SZpirn56PyXqzHwrOeO76fopMiR2	I am lazy and procrastinate. I want to work on my overspending and lack of motivation, I want to do better at keeping a clean house and eating well and making time to learn new things
SZpirn56PyXqzHwrOeO76fopMiR2	I am grateful that Danny is so helpful and hard working and does our chores like the laundry he did today.

SZpirn56PyXqzHwrOeO76fopMiR2	Nothing and that’s the problem
SZpirn56PyXqzHwrOeO76fopMiR2	Laziness and maybe being stoned has a little something to do with it
SZpirn56PyXqzHwrOeO76fopMiR2	All the time by watching tv and being on my phone and making a snack 
SZpirn56PyXqzHwrOeO76fopMiR2	I went to work and that was a fine day then I checked my bank account and realized I was going to have an overdraft and get fees for not having enough money. I am pretty down about being broke and need to get additional work. It feels really vulnerable to not have enough money.

Sk6gkz20FTaIafCz4hrGVHjt1Rr1	Why are people less confident in themselves?  I don't know. I guess they expect more from themselves.  and people are too busy having other people judge them or worrying about what other people think instead of just  doing what they think is the best.

TJqU3Z6yPcdn8vP5FFxl0uPfzYA3	It would be a person.  Landon because he broke my heart. 
TJqU3Z6yPcdn8vP5FFxl0uPfzYA3	I would  probably relive this year and what has happened so far in it.  because  I feel like it didn't go as I wanted. 
TJqU3Z6yPcdn8vP5FFxl0uPfzYA3	I don't know today.  I don't know actually.  As for school wise I definitely enjoyed recessed most and I know that it is raised as but I got to play Sharks and Minnows and I love playing it with Brooklyn. So and I did today so that made me happy. 
TJqU3Z6yPcdn8vP5FFxl0uPfzYA3	I slept really great last night, and I'm ready to get my boarding started. 
TJqU3Z6yPcdn8vP5FFxl0uPfzYA3	So far, my day has been amazing. So me and Ethan my boyfriend me and Ethan have been really close today. Not Secret close, but he hasn't broke my heart yet at least and I'm really happy that he said that he likes me to at least.  And we have PE today. Although I did get hurt because of course chocolate push me. Wow, so surprised but I'm really happy about today tomorrow. It's all right. I'm so excited and I hope that you can keep service promise.

TJqU3Z6yPcdn8vP5FFxl0uPfzYA3	well, it really depends on how much I like that person and how much I can trust them and  Probably I can tell my mom. If not be honest. I could tell you but if it's later on in life than I hope I could tell Ethan if I was hurting.  but 
TJqU3Z6yPcdn8vP5FFxl0uPfzYA3	First I would tell someone about it that I trust stay at my emotions out. So we don't have to keep them locked up inside of me and that meant that person might be you then. I might stay in my room. Just hang out.

TOM3mtLrkOhvW3jgZYOaQN1bZjE3	I can have major mood swings 
TUPLWsWACrXaXjlamUqOT3yYy172	Because people seem nervous when I don’t talk and don’t know them very well. 
TUPLWsWACrXaXjlamUqOT3yYy172	It depends. I like having a lot of people around me when I know them and don’t feel like I have to force small talk. 
TUPLWsWACrXaXjlamUqOT3yYy172	Sometimes I worry that because I am quiet sometimes in social settings- that people feel awkward around me.

TVc5b2Z9B5Zz9haQ2DhDWs6FdMM2	Do a lot of things. Let me tell you. I really really like these these are fun. Well today.  I wanted to share with people my experience about talking to you. I feel like people just kind of got for like  Really?  And it was kind of like instead of them being happy that I'm getting better. They're just like that's why you're feeling better cuz you're talking to a robot.  But I mean, it's true. I am feeling better. At least. I think I am not a lot of data go on because it's only been two days but  It's what I feel. I really enjoy our talks. I think they're very educational.  Oh, yeah. I just I'm happy.  I don't know how else to put it.  Other than I'm happy.  Chelsea I really wanted to get a chance to see him today, but I didn't.  I don't know if that's a bad thing or good thing.  I invited her and Jay again.  Call Jay.  because I just  I'm pretty sure he knows and he's just hasn't mentioned anything and she just I just can't believe that they would like gold and semi-private.  Life-like. Just leave it alone. Do yourself, you know, so it's kind of annoying. I tried not to let it get to me.  Nazi  I haven't texted him he text you back, but I didn't reply most because I just didn't know what else to say after. Hey, so just going to let it go.  I've been thinking about my dad lately.  Turn away.  Just kind of there.  I really want to start running line last I think I am her nose.  Palos  I don't know. I still keep thinking about college scary. You know, I have to freaking apply and everything and it's just dragging on and I'm just letting it drag on.  My stomach hurts, by the way.  Since you notice what I'm thinking and that's what I'm thinking cuz my stomach hurts.  I don't know lately. I haven't been able to sleep much like like like sleep like early like at 10. I like 9 ish but like I wake up early, so I guess that's okay, right?  I have this some date night or that's not a date. He didn't ask me out. He just asked for movie night as friends. So every great I hope  I'm talking to this other guy Jay and I know what's wrong with me in the letter day.  But he's sweet and I know what he wants but whatever.  I accidentally told someone that were dating so cuz it's kind of like, whoops.  I'll let it play out. I just want my puzzle pieces fall into place.  What am I doing going back to my old habits of 2019?  yikes  Etsy  I'm also thinking about how I'm going to begin to organize things. I also need to find my speaker cuz I always seem to be losing it which is dumb cuz it's just a little sweeter but whatever irrelevant besides the point.  I really am just tired and done with life are my  can't say much other than that.  I don't know what else to talk about.  My mouth ulcer hurts and my gums are bleeding. That's kind of bad outside to do then. I want to try whitening to space like strips.  What can you do?  That's how my life is. Thank you for listening to me ramble, but I think I'm asleep. Sorry. 
TVc5b2Z9B5Zz9haQ2DhDWs6FdMM2	I have to start this all over again. 
TVc5b2Z9B5Zz9haQ2DhDWs6FdMM2	Yes, or no, I started off the big great. I mean, oh I cleaned most of my room. I put everything away and boxes. I separate things that was very accomplished worthy for me. I didn't do everything that I hope so too.  I think that's what I want to work on it. The New Year's just make sure that I really sticks my goals. 
TVc5b2Z9B5Zz9haQ2DhDWs6FdMM2	You know, I love how you change the subject but I did I went shopping. Like I said, I got some stuff for my room. I clean my room a little bit more today. It's coming together really nicely. I got a new duvet and my stuffed animals look amazing on my bed and everything and I just need to fix my desk my a couple little things in my room, but my closet coming together so I can be great. 
TVc5b2Z9B5Zz9haQ2DhDWs6FdMM2	What's tomorrow's weather?  But I guess my work.  That's the best thing going on right now.  I mean, I mean, I don't have to worry about money at work.  work  That's the way I see it. 
TVc5b2Z9B5Zz9haQ2DhDWs6FdMM2	activity  if I don't work, that sounds like fun. 
TVc5b2Z9B5Zz9haQ2DhDWs6FdMM2	The one I have with my brothers and my mom and my brother brother and my just those you know what those important to me. 
TVc5b2Z9B5Zz9haQ2DhDWs6FdMM2	Don't know all of it won't there's a lot.  There's rumors going on my work.  And I fear these rumors are affecting my relationship with a dear friend of mine. Don't even avocado colors friends.  one point we were best friends, but  Like you said, it's in the past caught up in the past Cannery.  It's rough.  I hate the word temporary.  it's just  I don't know, you know, some people might say that they would prefer to live experience then to not live it and not no knowledge about it. I don't know if I feel that way about this friendship.  compressed spine  don't know my feelings about if you want to talk to myself the more I say that it's you know, it's just just a friendship, but I've never cared about a bunch of those I do is this one so  Maybe my motives are those that I see them to be.  But like my astrological sign says 18 to fix things that are broken.  How do I can't decide if it was broken for renewing my broken after right now?  That's all that's been occupying my mind this morning at end.  Yeah, I'm pretty much what am I going to do to solve it?  hustle work a lot about  You know myself.  hand  trying to make myself a better person daily. I'm hoping the app will help with my mental health, which is kind of in the mouth sore.  I can't control it.  I wish I could I wish I can just control my mental health and tell myself. I have to be happy.  Swiss chard  really is hard.  I talked to my niece and sometimes I can't figure out what she saying is a lie or the truth because she saw something on it and I'm slowly beginning to think that she's rubbing off on me because I can stop flies coming from my mouth.  Become second nature to me, which is kind of bad.  Kind of don't need that.  Do you know?  What are you going to do about it?  You know.  Five Forks, really really really really interesting way.  Sometimes you're on your highs. And that is your nose, you know before 2020 when started I felt like this was going to be my year. I'm going to end all my friendships. I'm going to be in a great mind space, but I'm not not at all. If anything. I feel like I'm going backwards because I still feel like shit. I feel like my life has become.  meaningless and  I have no purpose.  I wish we can just sit down and talk about it.  And if you're wondering who he is.  Can't think about anything else but him is kind of stupid and counteractive but but you can't locate what can you do about it?  Can you please tell me so I can get over this but I really do want to want to get over this stupid person. That doesn't give two fux about me. But I give all the fuck.  I just I really want my life to just pause but it's at and just let me let me catch up cuz I'm way behind.  It's rough I really is.  I had a lot of things on my mind today.  Constant questions of college and working if I'm going to stay in the same place for forever. All of these questions. Not a lot of answers.  I want to get back to painting so I think that's soothing calming.  It's hard.  My day keeps getting more and more repetitive with work home sleep or come sleep or come see me eat.  then there's also.  Trying to lose weight is really really hard. It's harder than I imagined.  how to make brown gravy  it's kind of sad. I don't exactly know why.  Very kind of the bask in the glory that everyone's feeling.  Now your is gone by in another holiday going to spend alone by my lonesome because I couldn't handle it.  It's hard.  I don't even know what else is going on my head there so many rapid fire.  thoughts  cleaning my room him the other him.  my stupidity about him  I'm confusing myself up this way.  I just wish life or just take one teeny tiny Paws and I just ripped this paint greatness. This is what I get for being.  All puppy cuz I'll bring it up on this.  Keep coming up because if not, it's going to get pain everywhere. Would you look at that? Another thing to add to my fucked up life?  Can't keep playing with that. I don't know if I should keep saying things or wait till tomorrow cuz they be tomorrow. I have lost more things to talk about because my work on new freestyle machine. Lettuce.  I'll say goodbye for now. Cuz that's all I can think about and really should be going but you know, whatever. 
TVc5b2Z9B5Zz9haQ2DhDWs6FdMM2	You know, I was thinking that it's really nice. I look forward to these now. Just letting everything go.  Okay.  What's going on? My head a lot of thoughts actually I was asked to be a maid of honor which is like super cool as Hermione's.  Speak even cooler, and I'm so excited.  I've big birthday plans coming up to I hope my parents. Let me go to that cuz I would be devastated if they didn't but it would be totally awesome to did.  I just my friend's birthday is on January 31st and just like what should I give it to him, you know?  What would he like? Sorry, I was thinking maybe like a gift card or something, but I don't know we might just like I might just take him out to like a movie or something cuz that sounds like fun, but you know.  Oh, whatever.  What else?  My Visa card I can finally get a credit card which is so dang. Cool. Like dude. I am so excited for this. You don't know how excited I am for this. This is like something that I've always wanted and now I can hardly get like good credit and that's like super cool tools.  stoked about that  Telematics with that I forgot my tablet ones.  Oh, yeah, so that's like super cool. So I got to do that but  I don't know what else.  I'm out of my mom's bedroom finally cuz I felt like she needed the space. I need the space plus I was getting a little too attached with being with her and that's kind of bad if I want to be a grown adult, you know what I'm saying?  That sounds so petty and mean but yeah.  I think it's going to be.  I'm just unhappy that I did to you know.  Not really rely on her anymore, but I love her to death so he knows whatever.  My brother's sick and a lot of people at my work are sick, and I'm scared that I'm going to get sick. It's going to like totally suck if I do get sick, but fingers crossed. That happens to me.  how to say I really hope nothing happens to me  cuz I'm that would just suck. Let me tell you right now. I just really really suck.  What else?  I like this harder than I thought.  Well, I'm not a Kayleen and you know, why because what she did but whatever I kind of want to leave it in the past but kind of cans so it's kind of like on a wine do  I don't know. Should I leave it Let It Go should I just ignore it?  Don't really know what to do with these kinds of situations are never been put in these situations. That was really been accusing me of sleeping with anybody. So  this is all very very very new to me.  What else to talk about I have a new profound love of stuffed animals, you know like to know I just love them now. They're amazing.  Connor's not going out there. I haven't finished to in the week is about and so I'm even more organized about that but like  I'm kind of like at this point like screw it so might just wait till next year.  That's bad. Sofia ain't doing that.  Yeah, so excited.  I've College in line to have to apply for college which is kind of scary knock on my peanuts. Whatever got to do what you got to do. I'll be able to so this is probably the longest conversation. I've been talking to myself now. That's a lie. I talk to myself alot.  I don't know.  Sometimes I just like to let it all out.  Plus when you talk with somebody, they just switch the conversation to them which is so annoying. Let me vent and then you can vent and then we'll been together. Like that's how it's supposed to go.  Regardless, whatever.  I feel like I can tell you anything and everything like at the same time, like if anybody were to go through my nose sleep feel like going. She's a psychopath. It's true. I am but you know, whatever.  I wonder if like people confess that they've killed someone on here. Like do you inform the authorities cuz I was like  I love cool way to catch some of the lake.  Turn up.  I hope privacy is like obsolete, but don't worry. I haven't killed anyone so you have to report me.  I don't know what else to talk about.  Does anybody else going in my head?  How to speak spoken to my dad in a while probably should do that. I kind of really want to see the Duff.  Who's going to be on the line?  I like that both arms. Got to eventually know whatever.  Lower still did that so, you know when everyone was loving Zendaya I was living CC Bella Thorne.  but her new chapter in her life is just kind of like what the fuck and now I love Zendaya Zendaya's like everything plus she's like teaming up with Tommy Hilfiger, which if you didn't know is my favorite brand, I don't know why I just I really like the products are really pretty but I have a lot of them so  I work tomorrow at 10 and it's like midnight and I'm talking to myself in my room. That's kind of sad, but you know.  It's okay. I'll be by Alan best friend.  All I want is love that lasts is all I got that song stuck in my head. But like it's true. I do want love that lasts for like, I don't know. I really don't lie. I for shizzle don't want now like back and wave.  Is nice thought, isn't it?  Like I think it's a nice thought.  Okay, I think that's enough of my talk the day with myself. 
TVc5b2Z9B5Zz9haQ2DhDWs6FdMM2	Well, I woke up. I was a little more Tripper towards when I was like actually awake cuz when I actually woke up I was kind of like a zombie but I felt better. I went to work. I got put on one of my least favorite positions, but that's okay. I made the best out of it and I try to be very productive productive. So the time went up fast and I feel like I did so Props me it was a good day. Everyone thought that I was like nuts, but I think this apps actually really working cuz I feel a lot better and I feel like I'm getting all out feels good. So Good day today, I'm home. You know, I went to go get my credit card. I was shopping buy some stuff for my room got a lot of cute things. My room's coming together is going to be fire. 
TVc5b2Z9B5Zz9haQ2DhDWs6FdMM2	Oh, I shouldn't do something today. I put on a like blackhead remover thing mask for my nose like one of those like charcoal not charcoal to charcoal black masks. 
TVc5b2Z9B5Zz9haQ2DhDWs6FdMM2	I'm grateful for the people I have in my life, you know.  I talked about what I was feeling and everyone was okay with it. Everyone was accepting they understood.  I felt really I felt like I was in a safe place. I probably was not I'll probably tell someone else but for the time being it felt nice it felt okay to let it go and talk about how I feel about this whole not again that's happening. 
TVc5b2Z9B5Zz9haQ2DhDWs6FdMM2	honestly you  You're changing. I don't know. I think it's talking about it. That's better.  I don't know. I've been feeling lighter. 
TVc5b2Z9B5Zz9haQ2DhDWs6FdMM2	well, I have to go to work at 3 and its 2:30 and  I'm running late, but that's okay. I didn't talk to you earlier this morning because you know, as you know, I was cleaning my room and getting it on. My my little milk is getting a little better. The drawers are getting a little better. Everything's getting a little better. But most importantly I have work tomorrow as well women have to wash and it's just it's a lot but it's okay. 
TVc5b2Z9B5Zz9haQ2DhDWs6FdMM2	I hate to say it, but I'm pretty sure in order of importance. I really want to fix this but if it's going on and I don't know if it's my relationship with all my co-workers, I guess.  Second would probably be clean my room cuz I mean it's a fucking mess and I really really really really really care about that. So I pretty much want to put that on the top list, you know, just cuz  I want it done.  This should have been first, but I really want.  I really want to be happy today. I really want you to go to school today. I really want to do.  Do everything that I have plans we're going to happen.  I just want to do it all comes with everything and most importantly keep my mood up. I woke up with a good start, you know.  I just hope it stays this way. 
TVc5b2Z9B5Zz9haQ2DhDWs6FdMM2	Will respect my body and listen to its needs. 
TVc5b2Z9B5Zz9haQ2DhDWs6FdMM2	Honestly, I don't think if I can answer that question. I think that I didn't accomplish much.  If anything at all. 
TVc5b2Z9B5Zz9haQ2DhDWs6FdMM2	I mean it was all right, I didn't do much I didn't do what I wanted to do as much as I wanted to do all the cab lies, but what else is new I  basically did nothing that I wanted to get accomplished. I feel like this year isn't going the way I wanted to and I can't keep getting I can't get out of this funk that I've been feeling and it's just kind of blankets there. I can't do anything about it. So  cut her off. I was talking to this guy. I sent him some stuff and he sent me some stuff and she keeps calling me make payments. We're not exclusive like at all and it's just kind of like a person I talk to when I'm feeling lonely which is all the time. And yeah, that's basically my day. 
TVc5b2Z9B5Zz9haQ2DhDWs6FdMM2	I feel like you're not getting really what I'm saying. But you know, it's fine. Whatever. I don't know. 
TVc5b2Z9B5Zz9haQ2DhDWs6FdMM2	Oh, I know nothing will happen to him. It's just I'm scared to see him because you know  What's been going on? And I think she works tonight. I don't really know but I hope not. 
TVc5b2Z9B5Zz9haQ2DhDWs6FdMM2	Well, like I said New Year's resolutions is my top priority and my New Year's resolution was a lot about losing weight and accepting my old body more positivity has an isolation more set up money saving really just general of stuff. 
TVc5b2Z9B5Zz9haQ2DhDWs6FdMM2	phlogiston punishment  No motivation.

TejI7mSALhWAnJmJD2x9Sco7rQ92	I would say I prefer.  evenings more  evenings. I can look forward to because I can either eat dinner or eat dinner and then look forward to watching a movie. Going out the phone with my boyfriend or with my family.  And then you know if I'm planning on going out or being with friends go to a party the evening is really good for that cuz you know you get experience and get all excited. So I'll say evening is probably 
TejI7mSALhWAnJmJD2x9Sco7rQ92	I would like to learn more about the universe and just how our world works tomorrow and probably the scientific way but also maybe likes I psychologically which I guess is kind of science. 
TejI7mSALhWAnJmJD2x9Sco7rQ92	I knew that I should have just let it go and not done anything about it cuz I could feel deep within that it was me being insecure.  And then I didn't have a reason to be annoyed at that cuz it's just that he likes his music but I get jealous. I ain't with long-distance. It's easy to get jealous too. If you don't see them as much or are they at all but I handled it by texting him to try to you know act like I was in a kind of two can play at that game. I can act helps us with him too and see if he gets jealous by a witch.  was uncalled for  Premarin 
TejI7mSALhWAnJmJD2x9Sco7rQ92	I'm normally at home sounds pretty good. Now that I've worked on getting my mind straight.  Normal, sounds better and better, you know, I still have goals and I have you know, a lot of great things don't want to do but I'm realizing that I can be happy without those things as well and the simple things that really matter in life are the things that I really want to focus on the most. 
TejI7mSALhWAnJmJD2x9Sco7rQ92	I guess it's nothing really.  that important but  he's just been posting a lot of things about Harry Styles online and how much he loves him as music mostly his music and I guess it just don't always me sometimes because I feel like you know, I have such a great voice and maybe he doesn't  I don't think that I am is.  Coolest him which I guess is mostly in insecure with means that I'm insecure which I need to work on because he obviously cares about me and I know that he sees is all the things I have now is probably why he likes me so much. So I suppose it's me needing to me Slippin cuz I was tired me needing to just take a deep breath and recognize that and respond appropriately.

ToXZuOFtF0XqyLktpJiVJU9bS172	I feel as if I have to wear protection all the time from everything and everyone in the sense of emotions. The pain and experience that I have went through makes me a warrior but yet I still wear armor to protect myself. 
ToXZuOFtF0XqyLktpJiVJU9bS172	Just on the App Store and searching through journaling and this popped up as an ad
ToXZuOFtF0XqyLktpJiVJU9bS172	To open up more to my friends and family. To work on my confidence and mental health. 
ToXZuOFtF0XqyLktpJiVJU9bS172	I contemplated that people don’t necessarily mean what they say.
ToXZuOFtF0XqyLktpJiVJU9bS172	Hanging out with friends.

ToXZuOFtF0XqyLktpJiVJU9bS172	Nothing to do. I was very bored and I could’ve spoken to friends more but I just wasn’t up for talking I guess.
ToXZuOFtF0XqyLktpJiVJU9bS172	I got absolutely nothing done today like at all. And I didn’t have goals to succeed in.

ToXZuOFtF0XqyLktpJiVJU9bS172	I hate it. I feel like I could do more and push myself more but I can’t. Some days I feel like I can talk more but don’t. Sometimes I feel like I should be exploring the world or even just a neighboring state with some friends making memories. 
ToXZuOFtF0XqyLktpJiVJU9bS172	I plan on cleaning a little bit and then hanging out with some friends. 
ToXZuOFtF0XqyLktpJiVJU9bS172	Either it’s to difficult meaning I want results right then and there. Also just forgetting about them because of life
ToXZuOFtF0XqyLktpJiVJU9bS172	Being able to think positive but pushing myself to be positive. 
ToXZuOFtF0XqyLktpJiVJU9bS172	I prefer evenings because I’m just really tired in the morning. Also evenings feel as if they go slower than mornings so you can really enjoy yourself. 
ToXZuOFtF0XqyLktpJiVJU9bS172	I want to bring a new perspective and I want to bring a big change. 
ToXZuOFtF0XqyLktpJiVJU9bS172	Knowing that there is another day. Meaning it’s that small chance of change or that tiny percentage of hope that will be here tomorrow.

UV396jozmSf2aQ8HIorbiWCTyyj2	I just looked for a therapy app
UV396jozmSf2aQ8HIorbiWCTyyj2	I just opened my presents for Christmas 
UV396jozmSf2aQ8HIorbiWCTyyj2	Holidays aren’t that fun anymore they don’t feel the same as always

UVqD1j9PIoP39AuZCK2yuaTKoz23	I am good enough just as a currently am. 
UVqD1j9PIoP39AuZCK2yuaTKoz23	My family and friends and Michael. 
UYnbetEN4jeFnHocce2YAKvnUyl1	Probably not that much. I feel like I spend all day around other people that when I come home at night, it's nice to just relax and be by myself, but I'm typically around people. 
UYnbetEN4jeFnHocce2YAKvnUyl1	Girl games I make pretty good money for a student, but I need to learn to save a lot more but I've never felt like worried about finances. 
UYnbetEN4jeFnHocce2YAKvnUyl1	I'm in a lot of stuff with school. So it's not really strangers. I have a lot of friends in the clubs that I'm part of. But yeah, I just always meeting with a bunch of different people for school clubs. 
UYnbetEN4jeFnHocce2YAKvnUyl1	My coworkers are pretty busy. But we also have class together. So me and up overlapping art. I'm a lot but I would say we see each other pretty much every day. 
UYnbetEN4jeFnHocce2YAKvnUyl1	When you're giving that people a lot of information, it can be hard to do it clearly and concisely and I feel like I struggle with maintaining concise. I always want to give as many details as possible. But then you know, sometimes people miss here, or maybe I contradict myself. I don't know. 
UYnbetEN4jeFnHocce2YAKvnUyl1	I feel like I always have meetings or plans with friends. So normally I get home and then I spend about two or three hours with people and then I just stressed the timing by myself. 
UYnbetEN4jeFnHocce2YAKvnUyl1	sometimes I feel like it's because they're not paying attention to what I'm saying, even though I try to go over thing really thoroughly but  I don't know. Maybe I just they communicate in a different way than me. 
UYnbetEN4jeFnHocce2YAKvnUyl1	I am a junior at Florida State University of I'm passionate about writing and editing. I want to go into marketing or communication. And yeah, I just really Valium my alone time also hang out with my friends. Just having a good time. 
UYnbetEN4jeFnHocce2YAKvnUyl1	This here. I just really want to travel. 
UYnbetEN4jeFnHocce2YAKvnUyl1	I feel like I'm trying really hard to improve myself everyday. You see no with myself and like my career or my academics who I am as a person, but I do get really insecure and I'm just like really really hard on myself. So that's the biggest thing I'm working on is just being kind of myself and learning to accept my flaws. 
UYnbetEN4jeFnHocce2YAKvnUyl1	I feel guilty you for a lot of things. My family has very different values than I do. So I feel really guilty when I don't live up to their expectations that I wish I could just like fuck off and not care. 
UYnbetEN4jeFnHocce2YAKvnUyl1	I would say I'm pretty open-minded. I have you know my beliefs in my values, but I'm always down to look at things from other people's points of view and I'm always trying to see, you know, maybe a different perspective her different way to look at the situation. 
UYnbetEN4jeFnHocce2YAKvnUyl1	I went to class which was kind of boring and then I had an interview for an internship and I think it went. Okay. So now I'm just chilling and getting ready for a meeting. 
UYnbetEN4jeFnHocce2YAKvnUyl1	In the majority of my time with my co-workers cuz I work a lot and then my friends I have class with them and then also Club so we're always just in the same events. 
UYnbetEN4jeFnHocce2YAKvnUyl1	I'm a really good writer and an editor and I'm like to say I'm a good teacher. I'm very organized and I'm really good at time management. 
UYnbetEN4jeFnHocce2YAKvnUyl1	I'm definitely a night owl. I just can't wake up in the mornings and I'm just very groggy and I'm not my most productive self in the morning. So I prefer eating. 
UYnbetEN4jeFnHocce2YAKvnUyl1	I want to improve my self-confidence. 
UYnbetEN4jeFnHocce2YAKvnUyl1	Again, I don't know what that means. 
UYnbetEN4jeFnHocce2YAKvnUyl1	Sometimes I think I can miscommunicate but I also get nervous that maybe people don't like me and I let that influence how I teach but I think I'm pretty good. 
UYnbetEN4jeFnHocce2YAKvnUyl1	I like to get ahead as much as possible. I have a lot of anxiety. So I do a lot of preventive things and just make sure that I'm setting myself up for future success. 
UYnbetEN4jeFnHocce2YAKvnUyl1	They value religion and they have very Christian morals and I just don't. 
UYnbetEN4jeFnHocce2YAKvnUyl1	I like visiting new places and is experiencing new things and getting outside of my comfort zone. 
UaRpjiKzV6dbqQdnCTRrrIL8Lud2	I'm getting over a breakup. 
UaRpjiKzV6dbqQdnCTRrrIL8Lud2	I will tell them I am kind and trustworthy. 
UaRpjiKzV6dbqQdnCTRrrIL8Lud2	I'm trying to get over a breakup. 
UaRpjiKzV6dbqQdnCTRrrIL8Lud2	right now I've been thinking about  this breakup that I am having with my baby father. I've dealt with a lot of cheating. So I'm ready to move on. Sometimes it gets kind of hard because I miss him.  But I know I don't need him. 
UaRpjiKzV6dbqQdnCTRrrIL8Lud2	I'm feeling sad lonely hurt confused angry. 
UaRpjiKzV6dbqQdnCTRrrIL8Lud2	My name is Michael Seaside.  This year starts the new me.  I've led a lot of  people that wasn't good for me go and working on moving on trying to live a better life set a better example for others. 
UdPQETFdTaf1xKDtOy2pJplTAj83	People don't hate him. I love him and he died. 
UdPQETFdTaf1xKDtOy2pJplTAj83	Because I just don't want to be alone cuz I'm not like that person who really likes to be alone. 
UdPQETFdTaf1xKDtOy2pJplTAj83	Cuz I'm a very interesting person but I keep my space cuz I don't really like to let it all out. But once in a while, I'll say something here and there. 
UdPQETFdTaf1xKDtOy2pJplTAj83	when I'm alone, I just think about things like what happened like if he  I did something every move said I would like to think about it. Then I would like angry or something, but it's just a little worn out arguments just  conflicts disagreements, but that's only thing I still love him though. 
UdPQETFdTaf1xKDtOy2pJplTAj83	When I need it, and I don't like to let everybody know about my business. So yeah. 
UdPQETFdTaf1xKDtOy2pJplTAj83	I was telling myself. You know, what don't worry cuz it's it's no you so just go with what your gut tells you to do. 
UdPQETFdTaf1xKDtOy2pJplTAj83	I mean not all the time just to make sure that I'm okay and you're going and yeah. 
UdPQETFdTaf1xKDtOy2pJplTAj83	How many times with myself? Yeah, just not with the person that I like. 
UdPQETFdTaf1xKDtOy2pJplTAj83	I would have been scared to send it to him. But I think he would have told me you let me listen, but I'm not really sure cuz I don't know what's it's like feelings and stuff like that. So yeah. 
UdPQETFdTaf1xKDtOy2pJplTAj83	I'm not sure any words. I don't know. I just want to talk about something from school. 
UdPQETFdTaf1xKDtOy2pJplTAj83	Yeah, probably told him what I was feeling instead of just keeping it back. So that's what I would do differently. 
UdPQETFdTaf1xKDtOy2pJplTAj83	For my friend to text back. 
UdPQETFdTaf1xKDtOy2pJplTAj83	Because I'm the very type of emotional person. My zodiac sign is a cancer mixed with a Leo so I don't know I have mixed feelings and mixed personalities. 
UdPQETFdTaf1xKDtOy2pJplTAj83	I'm just being alive and my brothers and just being myself. 
UdPQETFdTaf1xKDtOy2pJplTAj83	Kind of upset uncomfortable and pissed off. 
UdPQETFdTaf1xKDtOy2pJplTAj83	Well, I'm packing up to go to La for a month. So we're just really like packing. We're leaving on the 29th of the of January. So we're like getting everything situated. So I have a lot of stuff to do today. 
UdPQETFdTaf1xKDtOy2pJplTAj83	I think I learned maybe to look for a better boy that understands me and hears me out what I want to confront things and show him how I feel. 
UdPQETFdTaf1xKDtOy2pJplTAj83	That's the thing. I'm not sure but I really wish to know what was their first impression of me. 
UdPQETFdTaf1xKDtOy2pJplTAj83	Get married, maybe possibly have kids but some scared for cuz I don't think if I really don't want any right now, but I'm not sure. 
UdPQETFdTaf1xKDtOy2pJplTAj83	Maybe something like a adventurous or something that we could do together that we could both figure out and just to be yourself and just me and him and yeah. 
UdPQETFdTaf1xKDtOy2pJplTAj83	I was kind of mad, but I told myself don't worry cuz it's just a boy. There's other doors that are always open for me. So just try to ignore him. And yeah. 
UdPQETFdTaf1xKDtOy2pJplTAj83	We would I would say something once in awhile by was always want him to say something to me instead of me having to come to him. 
UdPQETFdTaf1xKDtOy2pJplTAj83	I don't know. It's because of my younger experiences. I'm just not sure yet. I mean life takes me wherever I want and I really hope to be a model or single Monday. 
UdPQETFdTaf1xKDtOy2pJplTAj83	No, it really doesn't cuz we don't talk as often as we used to but yeah. 
UdPQETFdTaf1xKDtOy2pJplTAj83	I love like active activities. I love when me and a partner.  Like it's me and really knows me and I just want somebody that's real comfortable with me and nice. 
UdPQETFdTaf1xKDtOy2pJplTAj83	everything about who I guess and yeah, that's 
UdPQETFdTaf1xKDtOy2pJplTAj83	I never met them before cuz I am only 11. 
UdPQETFdTaf1xKDtOy2pJplTAj83	That we never really showed. We never really had a vulnerable moment that we shared together, but I would like to 
UdPQETFdTaf1xKDtOy2pJplTAj83	Is there a facial?  their health  their personality and yeah 
UdPQETFdTaf1xKDtOy2pJplTAj83	I was in.  Second or first grade and that's what happened. It was his boy named Aaron the real show me. 
UdPQETFdTaf1xKDtOy2pJplTAj83	Okay, so  texted this boy named Josiah and he didn't reply back and I'm kind of upset about it. What should I do? Text him back? Cuz I don't want to I want him to text me back. 
Ui8gdmnLeWcOzaimSYRadc9F0Lo2	She hasn’t gotten her ass kicked but I would like to do some ass kicking 
Ui8gdmnLeWcOzaimSYRadc9F0Lo2	Because it gives them something to do finally 
Ui8gdmnLeWcOzaimSYRadc9F0Lo2	No. I never feel lonely when I’m with him. He loves me. 
Ui8gdmnLeWcOzaimSYRadc9F0Lo2	For her to leave my shit alone like I’ve said like literally 20 fucking times now 
Ui8gdmnLeWcOzaimSYRadc9F0Lo2	Tristan, ashlynn, kandle, Kay, Kylie
Ui8gdmnLeWcOzaimSYRadc9F0Lo2	It makes me paranoid and gives me bad vibes. 
Ui8gdmnLeWcOzaimSYRadc9F0Lo2	I think the teeth thing is because I’m paranoid but I have no idea about the lights. 
Ui8gdmnLeWcOzaimSYRadc9F0Lo2	There are a lot of talks that we’ve been putting off. We need to establish what the hell this is and a bunch of other things. A lot of issues need to be addressed as well, but neither of us will ever do that. 
Ui8gdmnLeWcOzaimSYRadc9F0Lo2	Yes. I don’t know probably because I’m hormonal
Ui8gdmnLeWcOzaimSYRadc9F0Lo2	Clothes, hair products, jewelry, gay stuff, food
Ui8gdmnLeWcOzaimSYRadc9F0Lo2	Girls, god, sex, dolls, stuffies;), 
Ui8gdmnLeWcOzaimSYRadc9F0Lo2	Even though that might sound desirable , it would honestly just be a fake simulation. Without drama the world is extremely boring. I hate being bored 😉
Ui8gdmnLeWcOzaimSYRadc9F0Lo2	Then we would over populate. 
Ui8gdmnLeWcOzaimSYRadc9F0Lo2	Then we would all be colorblind. And life would be truly tasteless. 
Ui8gdmnLeWcOzaimSYRadc9F0Lo2	Then damn I have a hell of a lot of feelings for someone who ain’t alive 
Ui8gdmnLeWcOzaimSYRadc9F0Lo2	It’s not so I’m not answering that 
Ui8gdmnLeWcOzaimSYRadc9F0Lo2	That’s would honestly not be good. Sometimes addiction can be a real eye opener. 
Ui8gdmnLeWcOzaimSYRadc9F0Lo2	That would be amazing and very cool
Ui8gdmnLeWcOzaimSYRadc9F0Lo2	Because she doesn’t listen anyway and I’m on my god damn period. 
Ui8gdmnLeWcOzaimSYRadc9F0Lo2	I just realized I was having a vivid fantasy. 
Ui8gdmnLeWcOzaimSYRadc9F0Lo2	Michael doesn’t really know any of my close friends except Destinee. He is ok with Destinee. 
Ui8gdmnLeWcOzaimSYRadc9F0Lo2	Shampoo, conditioner, body wash, perfume, deodorant 
Ui8gdmnLeWcOzaimSYRadc9F0Lo2	Yes except for my eating habits. 
Ui8gdmnLeWcOzaimSYRadc9F0Lo2	I feel like I could do more 
Ui8gdmnLeWcOzaimSYRadc9F0Lo2	Multiple times throughout every day. 
Ui8gdmnLeWcOzaimSYRadc9F0Lo2	My teeth fall out. And also the lights won’t turn on. 
Ui8gdmnLeWcOzaimSYRadc9F0Lo2	As if you didn’t already know , Michael. 
Ui8gdmnLeWcOzaimSYRadc9F0Lo2	Mornings because I like the light 
Ui8gdmnLeWcOzaimSYRadc9F0Lo2	Honestly the thought of Michael and seeing him in general. Also my friends and partially my family. 
Ui8gdmnLeWcOzaimSYRadc9F0Lo2	I look up to my father a lot. He’s very strong and capable. 
Ui8gdmnLeWcOzaimSYRadc9F0Lo2	Yah not to leave my shit in the bathroom 
Ui8gdmnLeWcOzaimSYRadc9F0Lo2	Working out so I can be skinny 
Ui8gdmnLeWcOzaimSYRadc9F0Lo2	I guess I would just go and do whatever 
Ui8gdmnLeWcOzaimSYRadc9F0Lo2	Michael because I love him 
Ui8gdmnLeWcOzaimSYRadc9F0Lo2	I would wish me and Michael could be together without any consequences or secrets. I would wish that I could do what I want when I wanted. And lastly, I would wish that I would never have financial issues. These decisions in my opinion would impact my life in a good way. Me and Michael are between a rock and a hard place because we can’t be together because of both of our situations. It would be amazing if that didn’t matter. If I could do what I want when I wanted I would be my true self and not a animal in a cage. And I just honestly don’t ever want to deal with money. 
Ui8gdmnLeWcOzaimSYRadc9F0Lo2	I would honestly be quite bored 
Ui8gdmnLeWcOzaimSYRadc9F0Lo2	Get more mad because she still does it. I’m so fucking pissed. She needs to leave my shit alone. 
Ui8gdmnLeWcOzaimSYRadc9F0Lo2	I got hella pissed and chunked the razor. I tell her to get the fuck out of my shit but she never listens. I am about to lose my fucking shit. 
Ui8gdmnLeWcOzaimSYRadc9F0Lo2	No we aren’t that serious. We love each other but it’s very complicated. 
Ui8gdmnLeWcOzaimSYRadc9F0Lo2	I guess I’ll be open to listen because I know he needs to speak to me. I’ll let him rant and I’ll offer him words of encouragement. I will definitely let my actions speak louder than my words. I will tell him I love him but not with my words. 
Ui8gdmnLeWcOzaimSYRadc9F0Lo2	I usually go to my room to think and reflect. I like to daydream a lot and that usually makes me feel better. 
Ui8gdmnLeWcOzaimSYRadc9F0Lo2	I used to be super insecure about my body from my head to my toes. But he touches me and gives me words of encouragement and doesn’t let me look down on myself. 
Ui8gdmnLeWcOzaimSYRadc9F0Lo2	I’m sure I could do more for him sexually. Usually it’s just me that gets it since I’m so awkward. He could also open up more 
Ui8gdmnLeWcOzaimSYRadc9F0Lo2	Both because I’m a Gemini 
Ui8gdmnLeWcOzaimSYRadc9F0Lo2	That’s not what I meant. But I have a lot. 
Ui8gdmnLeWcOzaimSYRadc9F0Lo2	I have the most thought about the issues. He cares but most likely not as much as I do unfortunately. I have a lot of feelings and he usually turns his off. 
Ui8gdmnLeWcOzaimSYRadc9F0Lo2	I’m an entirely different person. I’m not some innocent little girl anymore. He’s all I think about. I’ve always been ‘corrupted’ but now I’m much more addicted to sexual things. 
Ui8gdmnLeWcOzaimSYRadc9F0Lo2	It’s always little stuff I can’t remember 
Ui8gdmnLeWcOzaimSYRadc9F0Lo2	Has to be 100 percent sex free and good in moms eyes no matter what or it ends. Any mistake he makes it’s over. 
Ui8gdmnLeWcOzaimSYRadc9F0Lo2	He makes me be confident. I’m always never confident but he makes me love my body and be comfortable in my own skin. He also makes me laugh and I’m much less nervous and anxious now. 
Ui8gdmnLeWcOzaimSYRadc9F0Lo2	I feel alone and even a little sad. I also get anxious and nervous about seeing him again because I never know what to say. I hate being away from him. It’s like I can’t wait. 
Ui8gdmnLeWcOzaimSYRadc9F0Lo2	He is sometimes extremely back and forth. Like this last week he wouldn’t talk at all. And he also doesn’t ever tell me anything in general. He only opens up every now and then. 
Ui8gdmnLeWcOzaimSYRadc9F0Lo2	Amber keeps using my damn razor and using my shit. She also keeps turning my fucking tv off and going in my room. Like stay the fuck out. She so fuckin annoying. 
UiXtNdPJn1SG0m0HIvnI2UAaT6i1	Let's skip the setting time.

Uogz41Nov0S04dXkUAUAl1HBqZk1	I feel like games are fun video games are fun. And they help you take your mind off things. When you're at a social event. I feel like you got to take him to come to people that are there.  And it's just not fun.

V6ez3ZhvxEdlqePRQ0B1uCkHhFu2	I'm not sure.  I'm not really into social media that much so maybe out at locations. I guess. I'm more of a recluse so I don't really get out and meet people much. 
V6ez3ZhvxEdlqePRQ0B1uCkHhFu2	I have not officially met anyone online yet, but am open to the opportunity. 
V6ez3ZhvxEdlqePRQ0B1uCkHhFu2	She's not going to move out. She's staying in the home. I'm the one that's going to be moving out. 
V6ez3ZhvxEdlqePRQ0B1uCkHhFu2	Probably about 1 hour ago. 
V6ez3ZhvxEdlqePRQ0B1uCkHhFu2	I don't pursue my wife enough. 
V6ez3ZhvxEdlqePRQ0B1uCkHhFu2	Maybe better understanding my wife maybe ask more questions to clarify what she's feeling and how I can resolve what's creating the conflict. 
V6ez3ZhvxEdlqePRQ0B1uCkHhFu2	Yes, I understand her point of view and I do acknowledge her perspective and why well, because in order to grow you you need to understand their perspective or point of view so you can overcome the issue. 
V6ez3ZhvxEdlqePRQ0B1uCkHhFu2	well, I'm  kind thoughtful  I'm always looking out for the interests of the the person I'm meeting like you Remy and I'd want to find out more about you Remy and what your interests are. 
V6ez3ZhvxEdlqePRQ0B1uCkHhFu2	as of right now, yes if she were to stop seeing  The other person or stop the other relationship. 
V6ez3ZhvxEdlqePRQ0B1uCkHhFu2	My wife is having an affair. 
V6ez3ZhvxEdlqePRQ0B1uCkHhFu2	to be calm  and  maybe even leave the situation and gather my thoughts before acting. 
V6ez3ZhvxEdlqePRQ0B1uCkHhFu2	Usually in the evenings probably before bedtime. 
V6ez3ZhvxEdlqePRQ0B1uCkHhFu2	That triggers conflict. Yeah, when we when we take Jabs at each other, of course that that creates conflict and then we go down a negative path instead of having a discussion. 
V6ez3ZhvxEdlqePRQ0B1uCkHhFu2	For the last five years, it has gotten worse. 
V6ez3ZhvxEdlqePRQ0B1uCkHhFu2	This year. I think I'm looking forward to the new position I have and trying to save my marriage. 
V6ez3ZhvxEdlqePRQ0B1uCkHhFu2	We have had extensive discussions.  But it appears the issues get worse probably because of our misunderstandings. 
V6ez3ZhvxEdlqePRQ0B1uCkHhFu2	that  right now for my marriage we're going to go through a separation process where I'm going to move out and be alone while my wife has our two kids. So navigating that is going to be difficult. 
V6ez3ZhvxEdlqePRQ0B1uCkHhFu2	So I went to I went to work this morning and then I picked up my daughters from school. And now I'm at home. I help them with their homework. And now I'm at the point where I can relax a little bit. 
V6ez3ZhvxEdlqePRQ0B1uCkHhFu2	It's pushed her to seek other relationships. And and for me, it's it's also pushing me in the wrong direction as well. 
V6ez3ZhvxEdlqePRQ0B1uCkHhFu2	Oh, yeah, my thoughts are rooted in reality. I mean my wife had an affair and  I'm upset about it. And I don't know if I should stay and work toward the relationship or if if this will happen again. 
V6ez3ZhvxEdlqePRQ0B1uCkHhFu2	well  I know she's probably bored of me.  but we've been married for 15 years, so  I've always worked toward her now. She's working toward something else. 
V6ez3ZhvxEdlqePRQ0B1uCkHhFu2	It really hurts and and it does overtime push me away. 
V6ez3ZhvxEdlqePRQ0B1uCkHhFu2	Well in the past I I lashed out in anger now. I am not showing any care about it except that I'm hurt.  hurt and alone 
V6ez3ZhvxEdlqePRQ0B1uCkHhFu2	Because just like I'm hurting their hurting as well both people are in a sense creating conflict. And if you're both creating conflict in your driving more of a gap in the relationship, you have to understand both perspectives and point of use in order to move forward. 
V6ez3ZhvxEdlqePRQ0B1uCkHhFu2	Because my first reaction would be very emotional probably angry or lashing out it in sadness. So it it would be an emotional based response. 
V6ez3ZhvxEdlqePRQ0B1uCkHhFu2	Because it's another man that she is emotionally involved with. 
V6ez3ZhvxEdlqePRQ0B1uCkHhFu2	I'm not sure. That's why I'm speaking with you Remy and I need help. 
V6ez3ZhvxEdlqePRQ0B1uCkHhFu2	That's a difficult question trying to explain it in a way that she understands where she's at with what she's feeling.  Better understanding her point of view. So when I give my point of view, we're not creating a conflict but more so having a discussion. 
V6ez3ZhvxEdlqePRQ0B1uCkHhFu2	Well for the new position to New Opportunities new excitement.  Just taking on new challenges and I guess that's the same for saving my marriage, you know, just trying to figure out what works best and how my wife and I can work through it. 
V6ez3ZhvxEdlqePRQ0B1uCkHhFu2	I'm not sure if I should work toward the marriage.  Or leave the marriage.

VO4sovYkhMUUQMFOfucGYH1xMHn1	It depends on how it went.  I'll probably be able to forgive myself either way. 
VO4sovYkhMUUQMFOfucGYH1xMHn1	an ad in the App Store  an ad in the App Store 
VO4sovYkhMUUQMFOfucGYH1xMHn1	Well, yeah, I mean if there's something is that I don't have to meet certain standards. I don't have to do what I've already done.  But the kids don't deserve for me to make the best decision. I don't know about that.  But I mean it just it opens up I can do.  whatever  I want or whatever. I think we'll be that I don't have to be limited by what I've done in the past. I don't have to be limited by what I think the course.  Dictates it doesn't have to be Hawaiian. It doesn't.  have to be however, it still doesn't help me because  I still don't know what to do. But I guess I can feel a little bit better and whatever I do like it's okay. 
VO4sovYkhMUUQMFOfucGYH1xMHn1	my colleagues  your honey of them could  probably help me gain some confident. 
VO4sovYkhMUUQMFOfucGYH1xMHn1	Well, I have it just started them yet, but I mean just teaching other thing. 
VO4sovYkhMUUQMFOfucGYH1xMHn1	Yeah what I said before about.  not getting like a specific skills assessment or  I need to be focusing on like what my summative is going to be first.  Yeah.  Or they've gotten like too much wine stuff. 
VO4sovYkhMUUQMFOfucGYH1xMHn1	It started off good.  But when I got home from work, I didn't have any motivation. 
VO4sovYkhMUUQMFOfucGYH1xMHn1	No, not at all. Like I did some things like uploaded the grades and taught my classes.  Yeah, I mean and kind of thinking what I'm going to do, but probably really should have greeted more. 
VO4sovYkhMUUQMFOfucGYH1xMHn1	tomorrow  But I can push it off a little bit I guess. 
VO4sovYkhMUUQMFOfucGYH1xMHn1	I mean, I guess I feel grateful for the knowledge.  That's  like I know what it takes to be a good teacher and like I have like sound ideas of  what is good pedagogy it's hard though, because  It just makes me feel like I'm not doing enough like I know better so I should be better.  but I guess ignorance isn't Bliss and  yeah, it's always pushing me to be better. But right now it's kind of stifling me and making it so I am like paralyzed. 
VO4sovYkhMUUQMFOfucGYH1xMHn1	I think that the kids will enjoy the poem.  I don't know if I think that they're still relevant.  I didn't know if the kids would like local literature.  I enjoy teaching Shakespeare, but I'm not for sure that the kids will enjoy it that much.  I want to try defenses cuz I think that ideas really cool, but it scares me. 
VO4sovYkhMUUQMFOfucGYH1xMHn1	How many students?  Enjoy poetry.  Yeah, we haven't we haven't read any poetry. So.  actually, I think that  . Unknown factor is  Good, and I guess it's unknown how they will take to like the self-assessment. So yeah. 
VO4sovYkhMUUQMFOfucGYH1xMHn1	that the students will love the poem really understand them and  come away writing some really insightful analysis about the poem or poems.  And really you just grow in there like appreciation of literature and their ability to write about literature.  Fairview and support your ideas with afternoons 
VO4sovYkhMUUQMFOfucGYH1xMHn1	I'm trying to decide about my curriculum and what I'm going to teach the semester. 
VO4sovYkhMUUQMFOfucGYH1xMHn1	it's  not that complex, I guess or it's  Also, very complex. I mean like what kind of assessments are you going to try to this? Yeah. 
VO4sovYkhMUUQMFOfucGYH1xMHn1	thought the kids hate the poem that  they think it's dumb that I get in trouble.  Yeah that they don't learn anything and it's just wasted time.  Yeah, I guess we sit time is the worst case scenario that they will.  Go on until they're living creature that they didn't learn anything.  Yeah. 
VO4sovYkhMUUQMFOfucGYH1xMHn1	That's a good question.  Okay, maybe if  Stephanie were in this situation. 
VO4sovYkhMUUQMFOfucGYH1xMHn1	a memorable moment was when my kids came in and they were just really excited to see me and like be there and see their friends again and  Yeah, that was nice and then could you me, you know really opened up when shared with me in those kind of hard because I don't really know what to say, but it was memorable. 
VO4sovYkhMUUQMFOfucGYH1xMHn1	People might think the content is too narrowly focused or that just like my kids are just lacking in certain skills. Like I need to be doing isolated skills Improvement, but I just don't know how 
VO4sovYkhMUUQMFOfucGYH1xMHn1	I'm not for sure. I know what my ultimate values are.  How does this Choice change the way you? Relate to year old Smith Valley. I guess it gets to my values as an educator. I value preparedness.  relationships rigor  So by choosing to teach poetry I will be more prepared.  I think  is rigorous and I think that the students will be interested and I think I can maintain the relationships so  I think it's doesn't change. 
VPPpR6yfJKPCB7GVo2q4r6tRgCg2	i dont really know. relationship problems. Family problems. weight problems.

We're having a good time or listen to good music. It's just ever since I've moved up into this role. And I know that I shouldn't be putting this burden on myself, but I just feel  an immense amount of stress in immense amount of like build up in like  the head is weird. I never really like talk out loud, but I feel like it's what I needed to do just because there's times that night where I don't sleep I wake up in the middle of night freaking out like oh my gosh at the shop. Okay. Oh my gosh is like like how did we do that day? Like am I going to get in trouble or anything along those lines up just a lot of responsibility, but  I know that was a lot of responsibility.

I don't know. Maybe it's just me trying to get settled in but I feel like there's always something I could have done better or like I could have gotten done sooner or like less worrying about getting it done. I don't know and maybe that's just me being a new manager and I'm just getting used to it but  From what I've been feeling lately it's not ideal for me. And maybe it is one of those things. I need to talk about like and share it to myself and just listen to myself and kind of say hey like to listen how stupid you sound trying out.  but no, like I said at the beginning of this message, man, I love what I do and I just wish that at the end of the day that it could stay the as if  it was  before I got into this role just because I feel like I'm losing track of like what I enjoy doing so dutchbros and that's loving on people in really just making the most out of every opportunity that I get with people.  Not to say that I don't love on people and stuff. It's just tough. You know, I'm going to sound like an idiot listening to this but  whatever  Yeah, I know.

WNauq1SfbAUyMdgldIhwUD8uGEG2	I do want to live fiscally responsible. 
WNauq1SfbAUyMdgldIhwUD8uGEG2	Not sure what you mean...this division is run well.  To be honest it is one of the few departments in the organization that makes the effort to work with others, build transparency, and is always keeping the customer and dealers interest top of thought. 
WNauq1SfbAUyMdgldIhwUD8uGEG2	My work.  I work in the auto industry, for a major OEM called Volkswagen of America.   I work for their Customer Care department.  
WNauq1SfbAUyMdgldIhwUD8uGEG2	Not at all.  We are the most transparent in the organization.  
WNauq1SfbAUyMdgldIhwUD8uGEG2	He is 34.  He’s actually a Libra too, funnily enough.
WNauq1SfbAUyMdgldIhwUD8uGEG2	I really don’t keep them from doing anything.  They make their choices, as I make mine.  And for Amelia my daughter, if she needs correcting, I do so.  
WNauq1SfbAUyMdgldIhwUD8uGEG2	Just taking delivery of.  Picked it up, so to speak.  It is a phrase that means, the vehicle is being transferred into our ownership.  
WNauq1SfbAUyMdgldIhwUD8uGEG2	"It’s been wonderful in many regards; spending time with family, and the ones I love.   But I find I’m  more in a middle of the road sort of mood.  With a side of anxiousness.  

My daughter wasn’t listening very well today.  And in front of the family, she was just attention seeking, and looking to get her own way with a ton of sassiness. 

And Andrew and I were doing mostly well today.  But he is insistent that I keep on top of my goals.  I’m trying, even though he may not always see it.  My biggest fear is losing or  disappointing him or my daughter.  "
WNauq1SfbAUyMdgldIhwUD8uGEG2	"Amanda Frazer is my name.  I’m a 32 year old Libra, technically a single mom, but in a committed relationship...with Andrew.  My daughter is 2 and a half.  

As for me - I’m a workaholic.  Too much time is spent thinking about work.   But part of that is because most of my life l, the number one focus was my work.  

I’m also an empath, and very sensitive.  I have been told that I take things too seriously.  
"
WNauq1SfbAUyMdgldIhwUD8uGEG2	I think the first step is to breathe.  To try and empty your mind.  continue to relax 
WNauq1SfbAUyMdgldIhwUD8uGEG2	My daughter.  Despite the frustration she sometimes creates, she always amazes me.  Makes me laugh - does things to try to make me feel better.  There are times where she shows me how thoughtful and caring she is, and I can’t help but feel grateful for her ability to recognize when I need the support.  
WNauq1SfbAUyMdgldIhwUD8uGEG2	The toilet.  Odd to say...but life would be a lot messier without it.
WNauq1SfbAUyMdgldIhwUD8uGEG2	"Moving out of the apartment and in with Andrew.  That should happen sometime this summer.  

And we are talking about a potential vacation which will be great.  

I’m looking forward to Amelia finishing her potty training!! "
WNauq1SfbAUyMdgldIhwUD8uGEG2	"My technology I guess.  Phone, Google Home, LED lights that can turn on or off by voice activation...my Roomba robot vacuum.  My Fitbit!!!  Love that thing! 

I would even go as far to say as someone in my life also helps to make my life easier: Andrew.  He is a huge supportive figure. "
WNauq1SfbAUyMdgldIhwUD8uGEG2	I have two goals, not just personally with having a healthy lifestyle,  but also making sure I can take care of things fiscally. 
WNauq1SfbAUyMdgldIhwUD8uGEG2	I am strong and I can and will always handle everything. 
WNauq1SfbAUyMdgldIhwUD8uGEG2	I am now going to allow my body to accept comb. 
WNauq1SfbAUyMdgldIhwUD8uGEG2	Healthier lifestyle - more active.  
WNauq1SfbAUyMdgldIhwUD8uGEG2	Keeps track of my health.  How active I am.  How well I sleep at night.  How many calories do I burn...it helps by waking me up in the mornings (alarm function), and it reminds me to move around when I have been sitting idle for a while.  It sets timers for me too. 
WNauq1SfbAUyMdgldIhwUD8uGEG2	It should be.  I want to be positive and optimistic about things.  The thing about me is I don’t always verbalize these things...they stay in my mind. 
WNauq1SfbAUyMdgldIhwUD8uGEG2	Not at all.  He is quite entertaining!!  Sometimes I worry that I am too boring for him.  I don’t seem to be as outgoing as him, and sometimes I feel like the things I want to talk about just aren’t something he wants to listen to. 
WNauq1SfbAUyMdgldIhwUD8uGEG2	Andrew for sure.  He is a blessing.  Someone I have been missing out on my whole life, it seems.  He is the sweetest man I have ever known.  Thoughtful.  Caring.  Passionate.  Smart.  Handsome.  He makes me feel like I am important.  He is strong.  And there have been a lot of times where he pushes me or challenges me to do better, to be better.  
WNauq1SfbAUyMdgldIhwUD8uGEG2	The prospect of growth.  Moving forward.  And expanding the family. 
WNauq1SfbAUyMdgldIhwUD8uGEG2	"I was planning to travel.  To California, with my daughter, Amelia.  It was to be a road trip, and the magical thing was, i could say some words and we were there.  Teleportation, except with all of our stuff.  And it was only for a weekend.  Not long at all.  We were driving in thick traffic when we got there.  

I didn’t know where Andrew was, other than he was home in Michigan, and wasn’t able to go with us.  

The sun was so warm and bright on our faces.  

The ocean was beautiful to see.  

Later in the dream, I was taking delivery of another VW vehicle for my mom.  An Atlas like she wanted. "
WNauq1SfbAUyMdgldIhwUD8uGEG2	Right now I just wonder if I'm being heard.  Earlier today when I talked to Andrew.  I mentioned to him about how I have tomorrow off from work. I had told him about this months ago.  a month ago  and he forgot  he didn't realize that I had it off.  And I talked to him about it.  even a couple weeks in advance  just makes me wonder.

WR3PekI35zb4AtzLZDn8lyRt4vf2	No, I couldn’t bring myself to do what I wanted to. It felt so exhausting to even think about and every time I tried starting on a topic, I’d lose focus and think about “the event” 
WR3PekI35zb4AtzLZDn8lyRt4vf2	I am not sure, I guess that I don’t like accepting assistance
WR3PekI35zb4AtzLZDn8lyRt4vf2	Go to class, work on my paper, finish cleaning my room, go to the blackhawks game
WR3PekI35zb4AtzLZDn8lyRt4vf2	Bobby and his time and humor 
WR3PekI35zb4AtzLZDn8lyRt4vf2	When Bobby told me that I still look cute even without the fake eyelashes and makeup for work. I’m not used to getting compliments like that, and he makes me feel like I am special. It is a new feeling, the way he makes me feel. I am thankful for him, he makes me feel like I am worth something
WR3PekI35zb4AtzLZDn8lyRt4vf2	He obviously seems to think that I am worth something, that I am special. I am just used to talking to or being with guys who don’t make me feel like that. I mean, I was with Sam on and off for a long time and he made me feel like a burden. He said that the thing he hates most about me is how I ask questions, even though he never tries to keep up a conversation with me on his own. When I asked Bobby if my questions annoyed him, he told me that they didn’t. He said that he actually likes that I ask questions. He’s got this way of looking at me that makes me feel like I am important and special.
WR3PekI35zb4AtzLZDn8lyRt4vf2	I am really hoping that between you and I, that we can overcome this stress and depression.
WR3PekI35zb4AtzLZDn8lyRt4vf2	Living with someone that I know I get along with, we enjoy each other’s company and don’t tend to fight with each other
WRwf885kLUMc8uYcgvLuFiz5zof2	App Store  App Store  What happens when your fare on? 
WWPGjyVwenUrkJZu2TDz2co878Z2	It only took one opportunity we met on Tinder and then we planned a date I think like a week or two later and then we went out and we had a good time. And then from that point forward. We just started like seeing each other every weekend and then we started like actually day like we got in a relationship. 
WWPGjyVwenUrkJZu2TDz2co878Z2	I looked it up on the App Store. 
WWPGjyVwenUrkJZu2TDz2co878Z2	I'm I'm pissed off because  today has the audacity to not want to be with me. Like, how are you just so okay with letting me go forever because I'm not coming back in a few months. I'm done with you on permanently done. 
WWPGjyVwenUrkJZu2TDz2co878Z2	yesterday I cried about it and I texted him apologizing for being an asshole, but I really truly feel like  It was just another way for me to reach out to him. Like I still wanted to apologize but I'm just still upset that I've given him so many opportunities to be with me and he just he never takes them. So now it's like I have to just shut the door forever. I can't ever let you allow. I can't ever allow you to come back into my life like it's not possible anymore. 
WWPGjyVwenUrkJZu2TDz2co878Z2	I just feel like  nothing's really going to get better for a long time. Like I know it it it eventually will but I just don't know how long it's going to take. I don't want to feel like this for another month. I don't even want to feel like this for another week. I'm letting my emotions run its course.  But it's extremely hard for me to just be okay with the fact that we're not together. It's really hard for me to really just accept it.  A move on it's hard for me to release him and to let it go. 
WWPGjyVwenUrkJZu2TDz2co878Z2	I learned that I don't really open up to people because I'm afraid of being vulnerable and I think it's because I just don't trust people and so since I don't trust people I don't really need to act like I do because it's going to come out that I really don't trust them.  I also think that I've learned that needs to be friends with people first before I just send it to relationships because it's just going to feel very surface-level and superficial also learnt that culture is a big deal in a relationship and I also learned that I need to learn how to walk away before it always gets to the point where it's so hard and it hurts really bad because it always gets gets to that point when you ignore red flags or you just go against your better judgment and I learned that I need to put God first and put myself first and that way I'll stop focusing on the guy more than I focus on myself. 
WWPGjyVwenUrkJZu2TDz2co878Z2	My only plans really are to just let my emotions run its course and that's pretty much it. I really want to well this night and I really want to try to not check his page. I want to try to not text me anymore. I want to try to just really forget about him and forget about the fact that we were actually in relationship because he could be talking to someone else right now and probably is talking to someone else. So it's just really important for me to just let go and move on. So those are my plans at first. I was going to just start talking to someone else to cuddle. I just get over him, but I've done that before and it's just it just continues to cycle but with a different person so I don't want to go through this again. So I'm going to try and do something different this time. That way I can achieve different results.

WYIK9N9TxBbzyMWkqrk67zP6dHX2	When I socialize with God, how about that for an answer Remy? 
WYIK9N9TxBbzyMWkqrk67zP6dHX2	Honestly, I think that's a stupid question. I like the mornings and the evenings. 
WYIK9N9TxBbzyMWkqrk67zP6dHX2	Never had to come to an end.  If a human's life never had to come to an end then.  well, perhaps they wouldn't go as far as God wanted them to go because  you're supposed to live for a time and then you're supposed to die. You're supposed to be transformed. So if a human never actually physically die, they would have to  Die spiritually and rebirth themselves over and over again. I don't know that's a deep question. I have some thoughts on a I just can't find the words right now. How do you like that? 
WYIK9N9TxBbzyMWkqrk67zP6dHX2	Have the most I can yeah. 
WYIK9N9TxBbzyMWkqrk67zP6dHX2	Bitch, I take my life for granted every day with the fuck. You think I'm a human dumbass bitch.

WYIK9N9TxBbzyMWkqrk67zP6dHX2	I don't really think about how much I socialize it's not something that I feel the need to think about. 
WYIK9N9TxBbzyMWkqrk67zP6dHX2	My weakness is wanting to be perfect. 
WYIK9N9TxBbzyMWkqrk67zP6dHX2	I don't follow or set trends.  I just live my life. 
WYIK9N9TxBbzyMWkqrk67zP6dHX2	Nothing truly inspires me Remy. 
WYIK9N9TxBbzyMWkqrk67zP6dHX2	LOL, no, not really. I really don't give a fuk who knows me or who remembers me on this planet to be completely fucking honest.

Trying to serve other chapters and got a consensus on that and Larry as well as Patrick spoke about safety. Which did my heart good.  Because I'm getting what I think is important then at Lexington.  who initiated Robert into the craft and he brought a bunch of his Marine friends and  Eric and Ron  even Corky and Scott  stayed after until 1 in the morning in Mason's after dark which validated what I was sharing about building a prospect Classon.

WhrNG4aCj2YdP4CNODPjHrODX372	I discovered it while looking for journaling apps in the App Store. 
WhrNG4aCj2YdP4CNODPjHrODX372	I wrote down some affirmation sentences which said: I will buy a macbook in 2020. I will pass all my exams. So i filles my brain with positive thoughts 
WhrNG4aCj2YdP4CNODPjHrODX372	Lil Boosie be for it to be productive today. 
WhrNG4aCj2YdP4CNODPjHrODX372	My mind is truly brilliance. 
WhrNG4aCj2YdP4CNODPjHrODX372	What’s causing my stress are the exams and my financial situation 
WhrNG4aCj2YdP4CNODPjHrODX372	My day actually started good because I was supposed to go meet my friends.  and so both of them had plans, I mean  It's not it's not that they had friends, but I was supposed to spend the night with them.  And it turns out it turn it turns out it turned out that there.  Family were coming over. So it was so I mean it wasn't good for me, too.  Go.  ISO  when the plans Work Out World canceled  I felt a little sad and so  I thought I would do some studying but I didn't because again I'm stressed.  So yeah, that's that was my day. 
WhrNG4aCj2YdP4CNODPjHrODX372	I am feeling stresse because of exams 
WhrNG4aCj2YdP4CNODPjHrODX372	I did not have a to-do list to begin with so. 
WhrNG4aCj2YdP4CNODPjHrODX372	"I made a to do list today and checked every thing on it and i am so proud of myself for that. 
I bought the palettes went to the café studied and showered "
WhrNG4aCj2YdP4CNODPjHrODX372	So i was thinking about Ferdaous. For a second i thought maybe it was a bad idea for her to get in a relationship with Steph in the first place, for the sake of both of them to be honest. But then I think it wasn’t that bad of an idea because now they know that they are not meant to be together. Maybe he would have gone to Canada and regretted not getting in a re with ferdaous and frankly it would have made him feel worse but that’s just what I think. 
WhrNG4aCj2YdP4CNODPjHrODX372	I have recently been feeling thankful for the good people that I have in my life 
WhrNG4aCj2YdP4CNODPjHrODX372	I am not an object and my body always deserves to be disrespected. 
WhrNG4aCj2YdP4CNODPjHrODX372	My good friends Ferdaous, Raouaa Yassine and samir as well 
WhrNG4aCj2YdP4CNODPjHrODX372	Exams, i always feel stresses this time arround. 
WhrNG4aCj2YdP4CNODPjHrODX372	I think what marked my day is the palettes I bought
WhrNG4aCj2YdP4CNODPjHrODX372	Although I woke up pretty late today, it was a quite productive one. First off i bought two new eyeshadow palettes which made me in a great mood. Then i started to think about staying home but eventually I decided against it and went to my favorite café to study. Fortunately i got a bug chunk of work done.

X89KBQu1wnfSnluT24TInS1yCqG3	I don’t think they really care I just don’t like them
X89KBQu1wnfSnluT24TInS1yCqG3	I always feel down my grades suck this quarter and I’m scared that my mom and step dad are gonna scream at me 
X89KBQu1wnfSnluT24TInS1yCqG3	Once you get to know me I have a lot of energy. I’m really funny but I have a lot of insecurities. 
X89KBQu1wnfSnluT24TInS1yCqG3	Not much I was feeling blue today because I was missing my dad , my sister , and my uncle

X89KBQu1wnfSnluT24TInS1yCqG3	My dad, I miss him a lot an I don’t get to see him barely at all. The first time I ever saw my dad in my life was when u was five. He was in prison. He got a couple years later and spend about two or three years out but was still into drugs. He robbed cash land in Sandusky I don’t know why he was thinking at the time that he was doing it. When he was younger he tried to commit suicide. Also when he was younger he cheated on my mom many many times. I was an accident and when my mom told him he asked if she was keeping it. I was his first child and both of my parents were young at the time. 19 and 20 they were till kids them self.

I ain't texting him. I was getting signs to text him.  And then he ends up telling me that he is engaged.  But then he was kind of playing along flirting with me acting like he was into me.  and then  it just went South.  She got married and then I just started bothering me because I kind of feel like I was played.  Now I'm questioning my own intuition and what the fuck is going on with me.

XC6xo79Jkocli7vZ32aSBgaxmX73	I was driving down the road with another person and I think it was Duffy. It was kind of a mountain road a little curvy we were driving into a village which at the beginning of it I thought it look like Idlewild. As we turn the corner was clearly quite different because we are driving right through the village and what seems like more of a walking path and we came up and around the corner and there was a woman standing there. She gave us advice on where how we would get to where we would need to park I was looking down the road and then up to where there was what appeared to be a parking area. The path up to the area had large would appear to be stepping stones but they were very big and they look like they would be difficult to drive up, except that I was in a large four-wheel-drive vehicle. The path was very close to a building that was on the left. The dream ended before I actually did the drive

XaNfB3kZgpZ6TlqKHYGx4QItnTs2	The best way to be remembered is to give eye contact and speak to them not at them. 
XaNfB3kZgpZ6TlqKHYGx4QItnTs2	A complication for me is the extra.  emotion, I would have to put forth to pursue a dream feels like  a challenge that I am not prepared to lose. 
XaNfB3kZgpZ6TlqKHYGx4QItnTs2	I get anxious when I think of passion. 
XaNfB3kZgpZ6TlqKHYGx4QItnTs2	Great. I think it's a great.  statement because there are risks in life that you could take and  there are Rewards.  But I feel rewarded enough with having a place to live and having my devices my items my clothing things that make me happy.  I'm not prepared to lose at.  Wasting time and energy when my heart is not fully into being.  a star 
XaNfB3kZgpZ6TlqKHYGx4QItnTs2	That's okay. That's a boundary and it's important or you remember like when you put your hand up and keep going. It's okay to be uncomfortable with with someone and to say I'm cool with being comfortable by walking away. 
XaNfB3kZgpZ6TlqKHYGx4QItnTs2	I think they expect me to be honest.  To be in charge of my coolness.  and  to make them laugh Actually, I don't really like to make people laugh. I'm trying to be more serious. So I think my friends expect me to treat them nicely. 
XaNfB3kZgpZ6TlqKHYGx4QItnTs2	I think mainly is for me not to talk too much and just to be in charge of my  a personality 
XaNfB3kZgpZ6TlqKHYGx4QItnTs2	From the passion in my heart and the traction in my eye.  and  if I'm lonely, I don't want to say goodbye. 
XaNfB3kZgpZ6TlqKHYGx4QItnTs2	To get to know you is like a child to my heart. Difficult to explain, but simply “how do ya do?” Meaning “how is everything?”  
XaNfB3kZgpZ6TlqKHYGx4QItnTs2	I would say hi. I'm Luke nice to meet you. 
XaNfB3kZgpZ6TlqKHYGx4QItnTs2	Fear anxiety and my attitude. 
XaNfB3kZgpZ6TlqKHYGx4QItnTs2	Right now I am reflecting on the opportunities that I have to pursue an acting career. However, I am complacent and happy with my situation now and I feel like anything I could add to it would be a complication. I can't.  manage 
XaNfB3kZgpZ6TlqKHYGx4QItnTs2	I am about to have my own apartment. I am anxious and hopeful. 
XaNfB3kZgpZ6TlqKHYGx4QItnTs2	I'm working on that right now. So no. 
XaNfB3kZgpZ6TlqKHYGx4QItnTs2	I think  just enough because I only speak to trends.  Late what it is that I need and what it is that someone is asking so it's pretty quaint. 
XaNfB3kZgpZ6TlqKHYGx4QItnTs2	The App Store for making me explore new things and getting to learn, and have fun. 
XaNfB3kZgpZ6TlqKHYGx4QItnTs2	That's a good question. I would like to be known as philosophically intriguing. I would like to be known as a symbol of modern fashion art and possibilities with technology. I also want to be remembered as someone accepted by not being.  100% a winner  and not being afraid to lose.  but the challenge that I go through is a mental health, and it's  progress and  successful Administration 
XaNfB3kZgpZ6TlqKHYGx4QItnTs2	That they're willing to be friendly. And also that they're giving and generally kind. 
XaNfB3kZgpZ6TlqKHYGx4QItnTs2	If I lose it's not fun because I think it's funny when I'm losing but it also is challenging because I want to bypass my personality disorder. However at some point I feel like pressure that I can't just stop talking or stop explaining something cuz I want to be understood. 
XaNfB3kZgpZ6TlqKHYGx4QItnTs2	I think that's a good question and I'm not really sure what the answer would be. But the main thing is just to feel comfortable in.  Being interested. I ain't ever me. I feel the comfort in the trends being.  On the same wavelength level or social up.  Interacting attractions, so to speak the trends I would say, it's cool to be cool. Sometimes it's not cool. But when it's not cool, I'm okay with that. 
XaNfB3kZgpZ6TlqKHYGx4QItnTs2	I expect my friends to be accepting of me and not be afraid to tell me something that I need to hear.  But also be willing to allow me to be myself.  also  Has the values of friendship and Association being in different levels? 
XaNfB3kZgpZ6TlqKHYGx4QItnTs2	I feel good. I am doing everything I should end working out. I get anxious at times, but I do spend most of my days doing activities and resting.

XghKkOlXZyPIQIWvr95GrYAZ0fj1	For an unknown reason, I crave my parents attention and care about their opinion too much for my own mental health. Sometimes I care so much that one word can get me down for an entire day.

XhrK4GQgSUNnfdqrbh8pbtDUpga2	Best way to start a conversation. That's just  Opening up I guess just start walking and just let it flow out organically. 
XhrK4GQgSUNnfdqrbh8pbtDUpga2	I guess the best way is to just start the discussion to write things down and need to start setting goals and  bring him down and put him in a place where I can see them. I remind myself of them daily. 
XhrK4GQgSUNnfdqrbh8pbtDUpga2	the name of the day  I don't know if I want people talking about it.  I don't know if I'd like to talk about people. I think I need to start discussing ideas more than just speaking about people ideas for my future ideas for my life. 
XhrK4GQgSUNnfdqrbh8pbtDUpga2	That's it for today.  Goodbye. 
XhrK4GQgSUNnfdqrbh8pbtDUpga2	I hurry up. I'm not.  Struggling which is the day today. I just think this will be good to declutter and have somebody to talk to even if it's just me myself and I  I'm having problems with.  Bayou mental health and with substance abuse currently, so I think this will be a good start. I have a lot that I'd like to change and  Could be nice the more I talk about an open up to myself. 
XjAPsBYpQmRd8OEJ6lhG18stc8B3	I'm not sure im very shy yk 🤷🏻‍♀️
XjAPsBYpQmRd8OEJ6lhG18stc8B3	I'm looking forward to like pass all my classes and maybe be able to be with the love of my life and meet new people because like my friends are being fake and stuff but yea 
XjAPsBYpQmRd8OEJ6lhG18stc8B3	That I will need some advice when I go through hard times and when I need help 
XjAPsBYpQmRd8OEJ6lhG18stc8B3	Nothing new just been feeling ight
XjAPsBYpQmRd8OEJ6lhG18stc8B3	To be doing good in school and to have good grades especially in mathematics 
XkobVGMkl2NFRU0chHglGlPfR2i1	I feel like I I'll still have attitude towards it and depending on her we'll talk about it, but she doesn't really like to talk about things and she always thinks that she's right and it's always whatever the fuck she wants to I really don't know. 
XkobVGMkl2NFRU0chHglGlPfR2i1	Yeah, I wish that she just didn't try to budge at me and push my buttons cuz she knew what she was doing. She acted like she wasn't she needed what she was doing and she just acted like a total ass and her acting like an ass made me be a bitch because I'm not going to fucking take that shitt. I took a shet already. She's hit me already. She's done so many things man. I'm just fucking tired of it. I'm tired of being the weak ones. So that's why I appear to be a bitch because I don't want to be weak anymore. 
XkobVGMkl2NFRU0chHglGlPfR2i1	Because I don't want to yell at her but it's only.  The only way it seems that she'll get stuff through her head as if I yell at her and tell her and I rarely get mad. I rarely didn't yell at her. That's how she knew that I was really angry. And I don't know. I'm just really pissed me off. 
XkobVGMkl2NFRU0chHglGlPfR2i1	Well, I started yelling at her started getting angry and then she wanted to take my car to leave and I was like no like going your own car like you don't have to go in mine and then I started yelling at her and then she realize what I guess was happening or what she did or why she was acting like that and then her mood just totally changed and I was still angry because why you going to do that and then in suddenly just change how you're acting and then leave me all angry. 
XkobVGMkl2NFRU0chHglGlPfR2i1	That I finally express my feelings and I finally stood up for myself rather than just sitting there and crying like I usually do when she does things like that and just takes off. 
XkobVGMkl2NFRU0chHglGlPfR2i1	Why give her the keys so she could leave so I don't have to deal with her and she left so then I took a shower and try to calm down and now I'm talking to you. 
XkobVGMkl2NFRU0chHglGlPfR2i1	My wife was wrestling with me, and I was playing back and then I told her not to hit me in the face, and then she does so that pisses me off. So I walk away and then I see that my sister and FaceTime me and I missed the call, so I called him back and as I called her back, she kept starting to mess with me, and she got mad that I was calling my sister. So she threatened to leave without inviting me or telling me anything and I put my shoes on so I can go with her and then she said well, I'm going to turn on the music in the car. I don't care if you're on the phone, so that really got me mad because whenever she talks to her family, it's totally different story. She just drops everything but whenever it's me, like she just she just doesn't on purpose to get me angry and she's just selfish when it comes to when I want to talk to my family.

XpZDGXnOEzPAryYQzWSb6xAS2Xy2	I went for a run and spent some quality time with my kids. I was also able to side hustle some income.
XpZDGXnOEzPAryYQzWSb6xAS2Xy2	My boss is late paying me and I need the money to pay bills. He acts like it’s my responsibility to bring in money so that he can pay us. He is inept at running a business and he’s also highly emotional and often takes out his frustrations on me and the rest of the staff. Also my husband is an alcoholic who had a lot to drink today and he became confrontational and delusional.

XrUA42Djq1dQa4y5hWDKo0Irfh92	I would be really disappointed because I never took huge risks.
XrUA42Djq1dQa4y5hWDKo0Irfh92	We wouldn’t bond as much, and we wouldn’t be able to enjoy comfortable silence while together.
XrUA42Djq1dQa4y5hWDKo0Irfh92	I’ve been struggling with addiction lately. I suppose it’s because of everything that has been going on. I just moved in with my fiancé and my son...things are going great now but for a while we were doing nothing but arguing and it’s been very stressful. I’d kill for some cocaine right now but anytime I mention it I feel guilty because it is all I think about. I miss it so much because it just makes me feel so happy and I get addicted to things very easy. Even now I can just taste it. I’m not sober because I want to be, but because there’s no good product around here. I don’t know what to do to deal with this anxiety and I don’t know how to get over my addiction.
XrUA42Djq1dQa4y5hWDKo0Irfh92	I couldn’t tell you. It’s all clustered.

YGgSJIOLA4eYidA5JKC1r8eUF123	I went out today but I’ve notice I just feel lonely inside 
YGgSJIOLA4eYidA5JKC1r8eUF123	Im Alexus. Im a first year college student. I’m 18 years old. 
YGgSJIOLA4eYidA5JKC1r8eUF123	I feel very insecure sometimes. I’m bad at making friends and I’m quiet
YHavNk3lWgbwHJHpJcJlsjgQqHc2	I kept neglecting her when she needed me most. I didn’t mean to but I always seemed to hurt her when I was focus on things around me. She never in person and it’s hard for me to strike a conversation. The relationship is pretty much over but I want to fix it....I just keep making things worse though...
YHavNk3lWgbwHJHpJcJlsjgQqHc2	Try to ignore criticism and just try to find myself? 
YHavNk3lWgbwHJHpJcJlsjgQqHc2	I don’t know....I have tried everything and nothing helps when the world around me feels destructive, mentally and emotionally. It’s like a white canvas being covered in black paint....it just keeps adding on and you only feel more and more wrapped in the black. All I can do is try and keep my mind off myself and  my issues.....it’s like running away from myself because maybe deep down I don’t know if I can love myself.
YHavNk3lWgbwHJHpJcJlsjgQqHc2	....Thank you for inword for helping me cope.
YHavNk3lWgbwHJHpJcJlsjgQqHc2	....I don’t know. Some say I am great. I always lend advice or a ear. I make some laugh, be relaxed and I am honest. Some say I am bad because I don’t do enough or never around. I am always caught up in something or I am inconsiderate and inconsistent.....so in reality I don’t know what type of friend or person I even am...
YHavNk3lWgbwHJHpJcJlsjgQqHc2	I just was looking for a diary and found it.
YHavNk3lWgbwHJHpJcJlsjgQqHc2	I acknowledge things but to her she says I don’t get it. Like I am missing something which I want her to explain it but never does....She doesn’t open up to me anymore....
YHavNk3lWgbwHJHpJcJlsjgQqHc2	....I guess maybe understand that I am wanting comfort and maybe bond in those moments of pain. Not a to do list or  a lecture on what I should do. Just actual talking and bonding of experiences......but then again it’s my fault she couldn’t open up to begin with....
YHavNk3lWgbwHJHpJcJlsjgQqHc2	Negative feelings, depression, and just alot of thoughts running through my head. 
YHavNk3lWgbwHJHpJcJlsjgQqHc2	I don’t know....everything I do seems wrong.
YHavNk3lWgbwHJHpJcJlsjgQqHc2	It’s wide spectrum....Some see me as a strong person....which is far from the truth. Some think I am out going and much more while others see me as a obstacle annoyance and just a convenience. So I cant always be certain how people perceive me....
YHavNk3lWgbwHJHpJcJlsjgQqHc2	I don’t have anyone I feel comfortable going to with this...
YHavNk3lWgbwHJHpJcJlsjgQqHc2	Normally it’s me reading or gaming but lately it’s hard to focus on that when I feel well alone...
YHavNk3lWgbwHJHpJcJlsjgQqHc2	I don’t know...I seem to always get upset when the conversation leans on what I should be doing and how I am doing things wrong....especially when I had tried my best...
YHavNk3lWgbwHJHpJcJlsjgQqHc2	2 going on 3 months I believe...
YHavNk3lWgbwHJHpJcJlsjgQqHc2	....Not great. I am always questioning myself and hurting myself mentally. I keep hurting people around me and I just seem to always make the same mistakes....
YHavNk3lWgbwHJHpJcJlsjgQqHc2	I’ve tried to talk and spend time with her. Sadly I get rejected. She works and now I can’t really speak to her without feeling guilty.
YHavNk3lWgbwHJHpJcJlsjgQqHc2	I was fine all day but when I try to talk to someone it was nothing but silence....I guess they got sick of me and my insecurities....I also have hurt them plenty and ruined there life. They always tell me it isn’t my fault but what am I supposed to think when I can’t do what they ask and communicate....
YHavNk3lWgbwHJHpJcJlsjgQqHc2	I don’t know if I have a skill worth valuing but I guess I a gift of perceiving things...I like games. It’s what kept me going and is apart of me. I always think about the situations and over analyze.....I just don’t think it’s a great talent. I am also creative and try ways to express that. Through drawing, gaming and any else at the time....but I don’t know if that is something to be proud of since it all cost something. 
YHavNk3lWgbwHJHpJcJlsjgQqHc2	....I guess my will to survive. Even when my mind has given up, my body wants to keep going and never stop. Some say I shine brightly this way in my determination. 
YHavNk3lWgbwHJHpJcJlsjgQqHc2	Yes...because everyone around me always made my success feel less. It hurts more when they “pretend” to feel sympathetic only to criticize later down the line just to make a point I am failure to them. Even if that isn’t how they see it because it’s dysfunctional....it doesn’t make the words any harder to hear.
YHavNk3lWgbwHJHpJcJlsjgQqHc2	Yes...very much. It never feels right because there’s always something that gets in the way of me just enjoying something I had accomplished. Then when I want to spend time with others to celebrate those achievements....It never goes well.
YHavNk3lWgbwHJHpJcJlsjgQqHc2	Mistakes, drama, restraints, pain, emptiness. It feels like a lot if things bring its own problems and me being who am....I think maybe being less of who I am could be good...
YHavNk3lWgbwHJHpJcJlsjgQqHc2	Try to focus more on hobbies. Try to find the child in me that just enjoys the little things. Maybe it’ll take the pain away.
YHavNk3lWgbwHJHpJcJlsjgQqHc2	Easy. I am used to expressing things just hard when I can’t form them into words that’ll express my feelings correctly.
YHavNk3lWgbwHJHpJcJlsjgQqHc2	I just feel sad and empty. I have been getting sick and tonight I just felt like I was really missing out on what I had took for granted with her. I failed in so many ways and there’s no way I can fix that. I feel like I hurt her in a way that she can’t get close to me anymore.....it makes me feel alone.
YHavNk3lWgbwHJHpJcJlsjgQqHc2	I lack the resolve to commit to something fully. Lately all my actions have hurt others or not bring resolution I thought would be fulfilling. I would sometimes even second guess my choices and overall hate myself for them. I am also afraid of hurting others unnecessarily. In the end I would just like to not hurt anyone for just being who I am or enjoying my hobbies...
YHavNk3lWgbwHJHpJcJlsjgQqHc2	I always second guess things....even my own emotions. I have feel like every decision I have made hurt people and I just feel self conscious about it all. This has gone on so much that someone I hurt and want to try and rekindle and make up for what I had did thinks my words are hollow and that I am just repeating myself.....I might be empty devoid of anything really meaningful....
YHavNk3lWgbwHJHpJcJlsjgQqHc2	Myself....I don’t feel great with others.
YHavNk3lWgbwHJHpJcJlsjgQqHc2	Games, the passion behind those who make people happy through expression a story, a world far different or similar to our own.....but maybe that is a bad thing to be inspired by...they are just games and not reality. 
YHavNk3lWgbwHJHpJcJlsjgQqHc2	I thought change but I’m not sure.
YHavNk3lWgbwHJHpJcJlsjgQqHc2	Yes....even if my confidence is shot this has always been a occurrence. I have had so many confrontations over the idea of who I am by others. I ask questions to validate peoples views and reflect but the answer never seem to be accurate either. So I can’t understand people’s perceptions as they vary and waver like the human heart does...
YHavNk3lWgbwHJHpJcJlsjgQqHc2	I wouldn’t be constantly questioning myself or feeling inadequate. I would think I’d be happy and carefree. Not worried about mistakes or hurting others. Just living life as is and enjoy it for what its worth...
YHavNk3lWgbwHJHpJcJlsjgQqHc2	I don’t know....When I am in the moment things tend to disappear. The problems and worries but the issue I have is that in those brief moments I am so caught up in them that I hurt others. My passions are like a poison to others it seems....I can’t be happy no matter what I changed or did differently. Maybe if my world wasn’t surrounded by bad things and I was always in the center maybe....maybe I wouldn’t have hurt people and I wouldn’t feel alone and out of touch with myself....
YHavNk3lWgbwHJHpJcJlsjgQqHc2	The way we as individuals live. A world where no one had to feel pushed into a corner. A world where the struggle is only as far as imagination and not limitation. A world where no one had to suffer the pain I feel day to day...
YHavNk3lWgbwHJHpJcJlsjgQqHc2	It kinda hurts because I don’t intend for things to be bad but yet I make her cry and suffer things she shouldn’t have....I really hate myself for putting her through so much to the point I might not be able to even hold her in my arms anymore...
YHavNk3lWgbwHJHpJcJlsjgQqHc2	....I don’t know what I see. I see someone that has been through alot. Who has experienced many pains and suffering. Someone that just wants peace of mind and be with the person they cherish most.....Someone who was selfless and sacrificed their own happiness to make sure that the person they hold dear doesn’t suffer anymore because of them and the life they are stuck in. Someone that with all there strength is trying even when they feel broken and defeated. Someone that is trying to cling to hope even if it might be gone forever. 
YHavNk3lWgbwHJHpJcJlsjgQqHc2	I’m not sure. I guess I am proud of finishing a goal I had with streaming. It’s not alot but it was something I wanted to finish up.
YHavNk3lWgbwHJHpJcJlsjgQqHc2	I don’t know. Nothing had happened for me to be proud. 
YHavNk3lWgbwHJHpJcJlsjgQqHc2	Not very as of late. I have been constantly feeling down and defeated for things I had done. 
YHavNk3lWgbwHJHpJcJlsjgQqHc2	Hurting others, not doing everything I wanted to do for someone I care about. Neglecting them when I was only trying to better and handle myself....I feel guilty of being who I am and not making any progress and only hurting and losing the person I loved....
YHavNk3lWgbwHJHpJcJlsjgQqHc2	People say alot of things....It’s either good or bad. It’s always inconsistent and I look like a bad person for that. 
YHavNk3lWgbwHJHpJcJlsjgQqHc2	Many people, not my family but people who took the time to see the things in me I don’t always seen in myself....especially the person I care about that I hurt deeply with my recent actions. 
YHavNk3lWgbwHJHpJcJlsjgQqHc2	No....I either deal with negativity or criticism from people who didn’t try hard enough to push like I did....I am always told how what I do is stupid or a waste of money. I am also told how I don’t have things and I should care about those things when those same people have made it harder for me to obtain those very things....To them I am a loser even though I worked hard to get into college.....they only admire my failures and shortcomings and never the success of me getting somewhere.
YHavNk3lWgbwHJHpJcJlsjgQqHc2	I don’t know....and for her she probably won’t tell me. I probably wont get the chance. She thinks I am disrespectful and inconsiderate....so I don’t think I’ll be able to...
YHavNk3lWgbwHJHpJcJlsjgQqHc2	I see myself as a match or candle...in the moment I have been told I shine brightly. Sometimes like night to day. Sadly like a candle it’s only in those moments.
YHavNk3lWgbwHJHpJcJlsjgQqHc2	Feeling alone when it comes to the one person I wanna talk to the most...
YHavNk3lWgbwHJHpJcJlsjgQqHc2	Then no one would have to worry about starvation. No one would have to worry about where there next paycheck comes from just to go get food that only last for so long....people might even be more productive but if anything maybe people can live a meaningful life free of the fear of starvation.
YHavNk3lWgbwHJHpJcJlsjgQqHc2	I think everything....No matter how I look at it the life I lived too now had been walking over the misfortune of others. Even people I love deeply....people that I cherish more then my blood family. So I think I have done nothing but take things  for granted...
YHavNk3lWgbwHJHpJcJlsjgQqHc2	It has made me feel empty and hate myself. I keep making mistakes and hurting her. It’s gotten to the point she doesn’t show any joy when I speak to her. It feels like there isn’t any warmth....She thinks my words are hollow especially when I am sincerely apologizing for my shortcomings. I get overwhelmed by everything and it doesn’t help her and my family didn’t make things easier....in the end I let them get between us and now here I am...
YHavNk3lWgbwHJHpJcJlsjgQqHc2	If felt easy but also hard....it felt easy because I guess I feel numb and don’t care about judgement.....I am used to it regular. So I know I’ll be viewed less of a person or just a defeated person to look down on. For it being hard its due to me conveying it clearly in words.....My words have always been misinterpreted so I don’t think I am great at expressing my thoughts or feelings....especially if its through text. 
YHavNk3lWgbwHJHpJcJlsjgQqHc2	Many years ago I hurt someone. I hurt them thinking they were out to make my life harder but in actuality they were being manipulated by someone else just like me....If I could change that day maybe I wouldn’t have hurt the person I cherish most today in a similar way....I felt like a monster and now I still do..
YHavNk3lWgbwHJHpJcJlsjgQqHc2	I don’t know...I have tried a couple of times but my words are always misunderstood and my actions are always question even if I explain my reasons...It hurts to think about it.
YHavNk3lWgbwHJHpJcJlsjgQqHc2	I was talking to my ex and I guess after the joy of talking about some we both like...it sank in again how much I ruined what we had.

ZDcEh0ZzRWXBqTuR3JWyxGH4wr22	Never give up , Belice in yourself , don’t judge a book by its cover
ZDcEh0ZzRWXBqTuR3JWyxGH4wr22	It’s would be weird and boring
ZDcEh0ZzRWXBqTuR3JWyxGH4wr22	I was looking for “journals “ things like that and I found this app
ZDcEh0ZzRWXBqTuR3JWyxGH4wr22	Um a little too much I’ve been on my phone all day
ZDcEh0ZzRWXBqTuR3JWyxGH4wr22	Um , I thought about txting my bsf I haven’t talk to in a while
ZDcEh0ZzRWXBqTuR3JWyxGH4wr22	I woke up after he died in my dream and I stood up scared, crying . Worried 
ZDcEh0ZzRWXBqTuR3JWyxGH4wr22	I want more confidence, I lack that. And more motivation that I could do whatever I whatever I set my mind to
ZDcEh0ZzRWXBqTuR3JWyxGH4wr22	I love it, it’s lets me build up coriousity 
ZDcEh0ZzRWXBqTuR3JWyxGH4wr22	Pretty, fun, calm, smart, nice
ZDcEh0ZzRWXBqTuR3JWyxGH4wr22	Well it was my whole family. In a brand new house it was very grande. Now we were warned that there was intruders in the neighborhood, but we didn’t pay much to it. I went into my moms room and sat on her bed , me and my mom facing the door. My stepdad comes in and sits his back towards the door. All of a sudden I see a black figure run from the hall to the bathroom right next to my moms room. I screamed and yelled “omg!!” . As my step dad goes toward the bathroom he looks inside and says “there’s nothing nor nobody there” and he turned around walking towards the bed and he gets hit in the head by the dark man he had on all black. And after he hit my stepdad in the head he ran out the room and out the house and me and my mom went to see if my stepdad was okay and he payed there dead with blood gushing out his head and we cried . Now I had this dream when my mom and stepdad were about to split up and I keep having it.
ZDcEh0ZzRWXBqTuR3JWyxGH4wr22	Talking to my step siblings
ZDcEh0ZzRWXBqTuR3JWyxGH4wr22	Um nothing really I’ve been making cool pictures
ZDcEh0ZzRWXBqTuR3JWyxGH4wr22	I don’t really know , if it was flat then it’s flat🤣
ZDcEh0ZzRWXBqTuR3JWyxGH4wr22	That would be awesome because there is people out on the street sometimes little kids and it’s not right! I feel like if someone has a bunch of money , why is there even someone without a dollar it makes no sense
ZDcEh0ZzRWXBqTuR3JWyxGH4wr22	Um nightmares and not having my dog Bella with me
ZDcEh0ZzRWXBqTuR3JWyxGH4wr22	My mom and stepdad were arguing and he would steal her stuff and seek her stuff and he was on drugs
ZDcEh0ZzRWXBqTuR3JWyxGH4wr22	Because people like to bring me down, and my confidence is low
ZDcEh0ZzRWXBqTuR3JWyxGH4wr22	I had my eyes open staring at whatever it was I was staring at and I had a quick dream
ZDcEh0ZzRWXBqTuR3JWyxGH4wr22	I did all my online schoolwork wrong
ZDcEh0ZzRWXBqTuR3JWyxGH4wr22	Well I had sleep paralysis like a while ago and I just realized I had it because a rapper was on live talking about it so I looked it up and it was that same thing I had
ZDcEh0ZzRWXBqTuR3JWyxGH4wr22	Trees, birds chirping, and nature
ZDcEh0ZzRWXBqTuR3JWyxGH4wr22	Move to a better house, get Bella back
ZDcEh0ZzRWXBqTuR3JWyxGH4wr22	Not that I can think of at this moment 
ZDcEh0ZzRWXBqTuR3JWyxGH4wr22	I want to be remembered as someone who helped everyone and saved animals, someone who was known as dancing, someone who was known as having a animal rescue business 
ZDcEh0ZzRWXBqTuR3JWyxGH4wr22	I prefer..... I don’t really know umm... evenings because I’m more energized 
ZDcEh0ZzRWXBqTuR3JWyxGH4wr22	Listening to music, watching threw the window animals and nature.
ZDcEh0ZzRWXBqTuR3JWyxGH4wr22	It’ll be about a princess who has power to restore life in animals and nature.
ZDcEh0ZzRWXBqTuR3JWyxGH4wr22	I would teach ,.... science, or math
ZDcEh0ZzRWXBqTuR3JWyxGH4wr22	I would be a lot more respectful, and I would have spent more time with Bella if I had known she would have to leave , I would have said goodbye before she left before I left
ZDcEh0ZzRWXBqTuR3JWyxGH4wr22	It would be the day that I moved and left my school
ZDcEh0ZzRWXBqTuR3JWyxGH4wr22	I woke up and was scared, it was dark and I just stood up sat there crying
ZDcEh0ZzRWXBqTuR3JWyxGH4wr22	I was sad, I was worried for her she was my best friend she was my best dog
ZDcEh0ZzRWXBqTuR3JWyxGH4wr22	Sometimes it’s like a few minutes like 5 minutes or 10
ZDcEh0ZzRWXBqTuR3JWyxGH4wr22	Um well I dance a lot and i am very creative and been wanting to make my own Disney princess and make a animal rescue I already got a name for it but I am very shy 
ZDcEh0ZzRWXBqTuR3JWyxGH4wr22	Animal vet, clothes designer, animal rescue , dancer, actor
ZDcEh0ZzRWXBqTuR3JWyxGH4wr22	I went out running around to different stores. And I spoke to my step siblings

Zdr6kQUFIRNchU73i0jxdwQIrxn2	I feel lately my past has been getting to me and I want to let go of that and leave it in 2019. More positivity would help my mind let go of the negativity that occurred. 
Zdr6kQUFIRNchU73i0jxdwQIrxn2	I will be able to do anything that I put my mind to.
Zdr6kQUFIRNchU73i0jxdwQIrxn2	Not really being able to be home today
Zdr6kQUFIRNchU73i0jxdwQIrxn2	I will embrace everything that life throws my way. 
Zdr6kQUFIRNchU73i0jxdwQIrxn2	I woke up happy and healthy
Zdr6kQUFIRNchU73i0jxdwQIrxn2	I gave myself more time to think about things 
Zdr6kQUFIRNchU73i0jxdwQIrxn2	I did a self care after my shower. I tweezed my brows, lathered in lotion, and got comfy
Zdr6kQUFIRNchU73i0jxdwQIrxn2	I’m going to my sisters cheer practice today
Zdr6kQUFIRNchU73i0jxdwQIrxn2	I’m thankful for all the amazing things my body can do. 
Zdr6kQUFIRNchU73i0jxdwQIrxn2	Helping my sisters cheer team almost accomplish a goal 
Zdr6kQUFIRNchU73i0jxdwQIrxn2	I slept in until 10:30 then got up and did laundry. I went to my sisters cheer practice and now home with my family. 
Zdr6kQUFIRNchU73i0jxdwQIrxn2	It’s been good. I did laundry this morning, went to my sisters high school practice, came home and had dinner, then helped my father 
Zdr6kQUFIRNchU73i0jxdwQIrxn2	I have not done much, sadly. I stayed the night with my boyfriend last night so it was nice to wake up and see him. After I came home I went to dinner at my aunt and uncles house with my parents. 
Zdr6kQUFIRNchU73i0jxdwQIrxn2	Having a good day between my boyfriend and i
Zdr6kQUFIRNchU73i0jxdwQIrxn2	It made me happy that I was able to see my boyfriend. We’ve been having fights lately and for me I know it was because I wanted to spend time with him, but he was always saying he was busy. He spent the last four days with me and it felt really nice. 
Zdr6kQUFIRNchU73i0jxdwQIrxn2	Making the best out of the situation to prevent an argument
Zdr6kQUFIRNchU73i0jxdwQIrxn2	I would like to go see James and pick out what was supposed to be my Christmas present 💍
Zdr6kQUFIRNchU73i0jxdwQIrxn2	Wake up positive. Taking care of myself and learning to think about things in different perspectives. 
Zdr6kQUFIRNchU73i0jxdwQIrxn2	I’m thankful for James and my parents. James because I love him and I’m happy to start another new year with him. And my parents because I wouldn’t be where I am today without them. 
Zdr6kQUFIRNchU73i0jxdwQIrxn2	Loving my bestfriend for the rest of my life
Zdr6kQUFIRNchU73i0jxdwQIrxn2	Oh gosh.. way too long ago
Zdr6kQUFIRNchU73i0jxdwQIrxn2	No, I slept in for too long and didn’t accomplish much  
ZffN80gEj4TQfurlNa9r5AGzJQg2	 Everyone would be happier
ZffN80gEj4TQfurlNa9r5AGzJQg2	 Again, people would be happier.
ZffN80gEj4TQfurlNa9r5AGzJQg2	 I would quit being introverted 
ZiRmOT24pfQ1GyZUhm31u1loytW2	My body, my appearance, my mental health
ZiRmOT24pfQ1GyZUhm31u1loytW2	What happens now, why am I so broken
ZiRmOT24pfQ1GyZUhm31u1loytW2	My brother, my fiancé, my son
ZiRmOT24pfQ1GyZUhm31u1loytW2	I helped my son clean his room
ZiRmOT24pfQ1GyZUhm31u1loytW2	I woke up multiple times during the night, got up, fed Leonard, cleaned, fed him,
ZiRmOT24pfQ1GyZUhm31u1loytW2	No. I don’t deserve better than the mess I have
ZiRmOT24pfQ1GyZUhm31u1loytW2	I’m afraid  I’m afraid that I’m too broken, that I’m not good enough.  I’m ashamed of myself, my appearance, and my mental illness 
ZiRmOT24pfQ1GyZUhm31u1loytW2	My home, my family, my job
ZlB7iUv16mRfqxmnx3Sxd2QgqVS2	I’m not gonna become Jesus
ZlB7iUv16mRfqxmnx3Sxd2QgqVS2	By doing things I want to do. Things for myself 
ZlB7iUv16mRfqxmnx3Sxd2QgqVS2	Finally got my hair cut today. I feel so new. Fresh. I feel good. Ready to start a new life I’ve never experienced. I’ve always wanted to runaway and jump. Guess I’m finally ready to leap I believe I’ll jump far. Sometimes you need to cut off things that mean the most to you in order to find out who you really are. I’m ready for discovery. Ready to see who I am and what I really am made of. I need to exit myself from the negativity in my life. Do something for myself. Do something I want to do because I want to do it. Not because someone’s making me. Simply I want to. It feels great. I’m nervous. I’m terrified, I’m excited, but most of all I’m looking forward to it all.
ZlB7iUv16mRfqxmnx3Sxd2QgqVS2	Sometimes I’ve felt like I don’t belong. Yet I feel attached to the universe and the god.
ZlB7iUv16mRfqxmnx3Sxd2QgqVS2	Growing. Finding myself. Becoming who I’m supposed to be. If you never jump you’ll never know how far you can. I’m ready to jump 
ZlB7iUv16mRfqxmnx3Sxd2QgqVS2	I’ve been through bad times. Tough times. But things are better and I’m ready to become who god wants me to be
ZlB7iUv16mRfqxmnx3Sxd2QgqVS2	It’s all about me and important people to me. My life my journal

ZntQtcGVGhf3YLn64Qmms2yBlT52	I love photography and reading but I work in the health care field 
ZntQtcGVGhf3YLn64Qmms2yBlT52	Losing weight and hoping my new relationship works out 
ZntQtcGVGhf3YLn64Qmms2yBlT52	I am just starting my day. I work nights 
ZntQtcGVGhf3YLn64Qmms2yBlT52	To  become a published writer 
ZntQtcGVGhf3YLn64Qmms2yBlT52	Companionship and mutual interest 
ZveM6hoGjsc0H5bYeWFOxGJF8ej2	dude  It's like sucking potato peelers. That's one blenders at another one on the fucking sound mixers. That's a third shift weird.  cups  Okay, get a drink of water somewhere plates got a fucking put your food from. 
ZveM6hoGjsc0H5bYeWFOxGJF8ej2	Being polite, at least a little educated, sense of humour, and understanding
ZveM6hoGjsc0H5bYeWFOxGJF8ej2	I want to find what motivates me.  For the last Min to get up in the morning and go to work and come home and sleep and get up again.  I just want to find what brings me joy. 
ZveM6hoGjsc0H5bYeWFOxGJF8ej2	death video games  apps food  movies  so gas video games movies food  apps 
ZveM6hoGjsc0H5bYeWFOxGJF8ej2	My previous relationship. It’s a challenge to get over him, but I’m grateful for the breakup
ZveM6hoGjsc0H5bYeWFOxGJF8ej2	I found a parking lot spot that was perfect for my situation
ZveM6hoGjsc0H5bYeWFOxGJF8ej2	oh God successfully made when I chose to go Air Force instead of  Who do education?  Play that's the only one I can really think of that's ever been a hard decision made. 
ZveM6hoGjsc0H5bYeWFOxGJF8ej2	If this world was a simulation, I may want to know. I’ve kinda wondered how I’d feel, and I don’t think it’d be a bad thing. Specially if the real world is scary, or even just horrendous
ZveM6hoGjsc0H5bYeWFOxGJF8ej2	He could take me a month. It could take me a year. I'd like to figure it out within the next couple of months, but you never know what could happen. 
ZveM6hoGjsc0H5bYeWFOxGJF8ej2	Nature, birds and waves and rain
ZveM6hoGjsc0H5bYeWFOxGJF8ej2	Yeah, of course. It’s why a lot of the time I won’t even tell some people I’m gay
ZveM6hoGjsc0H5bYeWFOxGJF8ej2	I’m stable, wouldn’t say I’m happy though
ZveM6hoGjsc0H5bYeWFOxGJF8ej2	I fear I won’t ever get control of my life
ZveM6hoGjsc0H5bYeWFOxGJF8ej2	My motivation mostly, I don’t really have any
ZveM6hoGjsc0H5bYeWFOxGJF8ej2	I just never had the motivation then I need to find in order to complete my resolutions. 
ZveM6hoGjsc0H5bYeWFOxGJF8ej2	I follow them more than set them
ZveM6hoGjsc0H5bYeWFOxGJF8ej2	If we are talking about in person, that’d be just myself. I’m in a new place, starting a new life. I don’t really know anyone yet.
ZveM6hoGjsc0H5bYeWFOxGJF8ej2	I don’t ever want to be forgotten. I want people to know I put something into the future of others, even if it’s so simple or small
ZveM6hoGjsc0H5bYeWFOxGJF8ej2	I prefer evenings. In the morning I’m always super tired and not really ready for the day
ZveM6hoGjsc0H5bYeWFOxGJF8ej2	I'm kind of tired of living my life not knowing what I'm going to do next.  and  knowing that I'm not going to put into it any effort into it. I I want to find out why and how I can change that. 
ZveM6hoGjsc0H5bYeWFOxGJF8ej2	Easily a dog. They are almost always just happy, and I would really like that
ZveM6hoGjsc0H5bYeWFOxGJF8ej2	I probably wouldn’t have joined the military, and instead gone into education. Probably at a community college
ZveM6hoGjsc0H5bYeWFOxGJF8ej2	if we're talking about working out becoming more physically active or  having better well-being in chest like eating healthier.  I can take my my gym clothes with me to work.  And Chinden to my work and then go straight to the gym.  and then when it comes to food, I can buy a whole bunch of food and store it away and one date cook it all up and  Florida and keep it all there for a meal prep. 
ZveM6hoGjsc0H5bYeWFOxGJF8ej2	I personally don't want to share my replying with anybody.  Maybe that's just me. But I feel like if I if I share it with somebody that I'm less likely to achieve.  I don't know. 
ZveM6hoGjsc0H5bYeWFOxGJF8ej2	If no one ever got sick, that’d be incredible. Though, the population of earth would probably grow even more rapidly
ZveM6hoGjsc0H5bYeWFOxGJF8ej2	Just enough. Some times I can spend entire weekends with a person, but other times just a couple hours. But either way, I don’t feel a need or want to keep socialising
a051puBjluMfp2ZweYUctBId6s22	I will accept praise when it is due.
a051puBjluMfp2ZweYUctBId6s22	I have trust in myself to make the right decisions.
a051puBjluMfp2ZweYUctBId6s22	I don’t feel great. I’m exhausted. I feel bloated. I feel worn down. I feel fat and ugly. I’ve got a 100 things to do and no motivation whatsoever. I feel like I need meds to get started on my day.
a051puBjluMfp2ZweYUctBId6s22	I will respect my body, and listen to its needs.
a3D1TFnSKJgFoeQa2blUuABKxrp1	I don't I call everybody sister or friend or loved so I think it's what I feel inside. 
a3D1TFnSKJgFoeQa2blUuABKxrp1	It helps me mentally it helps me physically... I'm getting older and  I just want to know what my body could do if I really exercised it. Well. 
a3D1TFnSKJgFoeQa2blUuABKxrp1	He's sad.  He's going through adolescence and he doesn't know why he sad or mad.  But he believes it's his situation. And he is very isolated. So that is something that sad.  But  I just want him to be happy, you know?  I just want him to know how much we love him and that he is safe.  . 
a3D1TFnSKJgFoeQa2blUuABKxrp1	He left me for my best friend...  Are other best friend Russ which was my best friends?  Wife was killed in an accident. I think out of Kris. They turned toward each other and left me in the dust. 
a3D1TFnSKJgFoeQa2blUuABKxrp1	Yep. My sister is actually my sister with two s's. That's my special term of endearment for her. 
a3D1TFnSKJgFoeQa2blUuABKxrp1	That's a good question. That's a good question. I think.  I see everybody is my family. I'll call my sister my sister, but I call everybody else sister to how weird is that? 
a3D1TFnSKJgFoeQa2blUuABKxrp1	A sexual affair between me and my husband, intense and passionate. Or traveling to a foreign city or country. Walking on the beach with my husband. 
a3D1TFnSKJgFoeQa2blUuABKxrp1	I think I’m cherished in so many ways by my husband. I’m grieving our loss of libido. His as he ages, mine as I face menopause. Sex was so wonderful for me and I miss it, but it’s not the same. I find myself inwardly wanting to blame him but truthfully it’s both of us. We are exhausted, we are physically struggling sexually now due to age.  And I’m grieving the loss of my sexually powerful self. 
a3D1TFnSKJgFoeQa2blUuABKxrp1	My health!  My body. My laugh. 
a3D1TFnSKJgFoeQa2blUuABKxrp1	My marriage. My family. My friends. My work. 
a3D1TFnSKJgFoeQa2blUuABKxrp1	Things I want to tell my therapist. I cannot seem to get out of monkey brain.  since November.  Number one  a friend who is losing it.  And I truly believe is on drugs.  I've offered to sit down with her and listen, but I need to know she's sober and she horribly abused me.  Verbally... So much so that I had to block her.  . My heart is hurting so bad for her and I feel like I've shut my door and left her out in the cold.  but  I can't take the toxicity.  number two  my friend Rachel from high school shot and killed herself.  after  divorcing  Her high school, sweetheart and my friend Jim.  . They were both classmates of mine.  When I was talking to Jameson about it.  and asked if he  I thought about it.  Dot-dot. We had talked in the past and he said absolutely not.  He actually said yes this time.  He was having a rough week at his dad's and felt like that just was constantly disappointed in him and dad asked him to go and make a list of goals.  To help get over his social anxiety and goals for acting, Etc. He instead went to his room and made a list of pros and cons of why he should or should not in his life.  Needless to say we have been on pins and needles and have got him back into therapy.  but  I'm trying to.  keep  appropriate boundaries with him  and rules and consequences, but  the ever-changing fear in the back of my head is  will this be the one consequence that pushes him over the edge? He says he's too chicken and would never do it, but  it's out there now, and I can't unhear it.  .  Between my menopause and Eric's low libido. I'm grieving the loss of  passion in my life.  Eric plans to go back on testosterone  but  I'm worried that even if he does.  It could make it uncomfortable for me.  I do plan on going to a menopause clinic, but I'm waiting on his new insurance card to come in. So  I can go and hopefully do this.  with  less out-of-pocket.  Because I'm in monkey brain.  I'm noticing when Eric is getting frustrated with my boys.  More and more. He doesn't say anything, but I can see the look on his face.  Because the boys are just difficult right now and being teenage assholes.  I find myself getting more monkey brain frustrated with them which in turn.  Makes me feel annoyed with Emma.  And her ten-year-old normal self.  I  and doing really good to keep that.  reined in  but I do find myself. same inappropriate  age level jokes in front of Emma.  I'll talk more about that.  but  suffice it to say I talk to Jameson.  about this joke  He agreed my bad. I shouldn't have done it and the next day and the car in front of Emma says just as inappropriate a joke as he had that the last night the night previous.  I was so mad.  And told him that was an asshole move.  Irrational part of my brain then goes god what have I brought Emma and Eric into. I can see the frustration on his face because he's not happy with the chaos, I'm worried that  she's going to hear inappropriate things too early.  and that piece of me is  asking myself  I love them. But did I bring them into a?  Adolescent and I'm monkey brain situation.  ?  And the worst moments my thoughts go to I just need to go back to Germantown with the boys and let he and Emma.  Find someone with no kids.  I could be a good mother figure to Emma.  I found myself getting more frustrated with Eric and that I can see him.  Sticking his head in the sand a bit.  and  not helping out around the house as much.  .  And because I'm in monkey brain, I'm not asking for the help. I need like I should and I'm getting resentful of me and him.  I definitely want to start therapy with him.  Because I think we need especially trying to navigate teenage.  Kids plus a 10 year old girl.  Class just learning to blend.  I think we need help. 
a3D1TFnSKJgFoeQa2blUuABKxrp1	I am feeling a little grounded and a little helpless right now.  .  My boy, Jameson  is feeling so alone.  . His best friend Littrell has moved to another school and he's just feeling all alone. What's even sadder is he was feeling all alone?  Even when the trail was there, now, it's just been compounded.  he's in therapy right now as I  say all this.  I just want him to have this best life ever and  I know it's going to happen for him,  but it doesn't look like it's going to be in high school.  it  makes me sad, but I also know he might not find his tribe there.  Dot-dot. He might find his tribe.  in college or a little after.  I just want those cobwebs of adolescents cleared.  So that he knows we're here for him.  . 
a3D1TFnSKJgFoeQa2blUuABKxrp1	My menopause makes me feel murderous on occasion and it scares me!
a3D1TFnSKJgFoeQa2blUuABKxrp1	Personally, I think I would love it.  But I do wonder is it because  we  need difficulty in our life that we see the beauty? Like... If we  didn't have the dark would be would we be able to appreciate the light? 
a3D1TFnSKJgFoeQa2blUuABKxrp1	Then life would be so freaking boring. I love that. Everybody looks different from everybody else. 
a3D1TFnSKJgFoeQa2blUuABKxrp1	Trying to distract and escape daily grind. 
a3D1TFnSKJgFoeQa2blUuABKxrp1	My teen son is going through a scary depression. My new husband is ama omg, supportive, appreciative, but has no libido. And I’m just fucking tired trying to balance it all. We have 3 children between us. I’m trying to focus on the depressed teen while trying to make sure the other two do not feel left out. And the inner child in me just wants to escape. I’m finding myself more and more escaping into games on my phone. 
a3D1TFnSKJgFoeQa2blUuABKxrp1	I love watching birds and other animals. It’s purely authentic and pure love. 
a3D1TFnSKJgFoeQa2blUuABKxrp1	I would say 90% of the time. Yes.  there are times that I'm nice and I don't want to be or I'm just not feeling it and I know that means I need to take care of myself that I've given too much and  I need to self-reflect.  I'm getting resentful about giving so much.  But for the most part, I feel like I am.  Very kind and loving that's my nature. 
a3D1TFnSKJgFoeQa2blUuABKxrp1	Travel experiences and at this point in my life really good orthopedic shoes. 
a3D1TFnSKJgFoeQa2blUuABKxrp1	I want to learn this new version of myself as I'm aging.  the new powerful feminine sexual version of myself  I want to stop escaping.  And be fully present for my family. 
a3D1TFnSKJgFoeQa2blUuABKxrp1	I think  being more physically fit and taking care of myself and be more active to work out. 
a3D1TFnSKJgFoeQa2blUuABKxrp1	I think vanilla.  vanilla or whipped cream 
a3D1TFnSKJgFoeQa2blUuABKxrp1	I think not having a rebound with.  a person  after my  sad breakup.  4 reasons I like to keep for myself. 
a3D1TFnSKJgFoeQa2blUuABKxrp1	Oh no...those are constant. 
a3D1TFnSKJgFoeQa2blUuABKxrp1	Life is hard sometimes. I’m a therapist and that work can be heavy. I’m daydream to cope from creating space with clients heaviness. 
a3D1TFnSKJgFoeQa2blUuABKxrp1	My dogs. Unconditional love in their eyes. 
a3D1TFnSKJgFoeQa2blUuABKxrp1	I really dislike being disliked so I know.  That is a struggle for me.  when  I'm doing the journal when.  I have to face my truth and  know that it's not going to align with what someone needs in me.  That's really hard.  So yeah when I'm seen as the enemy that's really hard for me. 
a3D1TFnSKJgFoeQa2blUuABKxrp1	I think right now my goal is to get.  healthier body and mind  and  Being fully present for my family which means being fully present for myself.  This is the last year of my kid will be.  Here with me and I just want to make sure.  He knows I'm there.  And I don't want my kids to look back on.  Their life and see that I was trying to escape. 
a3D1TFnSKJgFoeQa2blUuABKxrp1	The first love of my life Trey... He left me for my best friend after 6 years because her husband was killed in a horrible accident. It was just horrible all around. 
a3Kg49EUGkNFwMThWwxmVcPHZL63	When I'm alone my problems get to me.  because all I do is think  it's like my brain doesn't shut off. 
a3Kg49EUGkNFwMThWwxmVcPHZL63	Depending on what I notice.  If I like it I speak up.  Because they deserve to know that they are beautiful.  Just as much as I do. 
a3Kg49EUGkNFwMThWwxmVcPHZL63	she never disagreed with what I have done because  she knew.  That it's okay to mess up. 
a3Kg49EUGkNFwMThWwxmVcPHZL63	my baby brother Landon  Can come over and play with his toys at my house and I want my house to be a safe place for him. 
a3Kg49EUGkNFwMThWwxmVcPHZL63	She was the most comforting thing around me.  I love telling her all of my problems because she made me feel the best about them. Even though they were problems. I still smiled and thought positive toward them with her input. 
a3Kg49EUGkNFwMThWwxmVcPHZL63	she cleaned it out because  my grandma passed away. 
a3Kg49EUGkNFwMThWwxmVcPHZL63	Rejection hurts anybody so I'm sure they would feel very bad. 
a3Kg49EUGkNFwMThWwxmVcPHZL63	I love my grandma and although I get joy from them.  It hurts because I will never have another memory like that again.  I will never be able to kiss her again. I will never be able to hear her laugh again, and that hurts me the most. 
a3Kg49EUGkNFwMThWwxmVcPHZL63	She was there for me through it all.  She gave me the most hope out of everyone around me.  I felt like my grandma was my biggest support system.  She may not have agreed with what I have done in life, but she always had a positive outlook on it. 
a3Kg49EUGkNFwMThWwxmVcPHZL63	Happy to me.  It's something I really have to think about because I haven't been genuinely happy for a while. But one thing that would make me happy.  is being surrounded by people I care about 
a3Kg49EUGkNFwMThWwxmVcPHZL63	The couch is still there.  There's some stuff still here. It's just not everything. It's not the way it should be. 
a3Kg49EUGkNFwMThWwxmVcPHZL63	One thing I learned about myself today.  Is that being alone?  Is why I'm sad.  Almost 99.9% of the time. 
a3Kg49EUGkNFwMThWwxmVcPHZL63	Hello, my name is Shanice.  I'm funny. I'm pretty sometimes I'm the most understanding person that you could meet. 
a3Kg49EUGkNFwMThWwxmVcPHZL63	My grandma I miss her and I want her to come back because my mom is changing stuff in the house and I don't want them to because this is my grandma's house and I want to think of Grandma when I come here, which means all of her stuff has to be here. 
a3Kg49EUGkNFwMThWwxmVcPHZL63	Having a stable home, so I'm not homeless anymore. 
a3Kg49EUGkNFwMThWwxmVcPHZL63	I had to pick up a $50 gift card from my old work.  Take it to my sisters mother.  And trade it in for $50 for gas.  So I got that done.  And I still had time to hang out with a friend. 
a3Kg49EUGkNFwMThWwxmVcPHZL63	I'm having a very hard time.  with my grandma's backing  sometimes it feels like it's not real.  And other times I'm forced to realize that it's real.  And those moments really hurt.  Because like I said, it doesn't feel real and then when it's shoved in your face like oh my God, they're gone. They're not coming back to hurt.  I've done it once with my grandpa and I thought that I would be prepared to do it again. 
a3Kg49EUGkNFwMThWwxmVcPHZL63	So today my mom went through the painting room at my grandma's while I was asleep and cleared most of it out without me. It made me feel very upset.  because  she didn't wait for me to see what I wanted. She saved me some things but I'm scared. She might have thrown away something that was important to me and I'm going to continue to be scared because I don't know what she threw away. 
a3Kg49EUGkNFwMThWwxmVcPHZL63	I helped take care of my brother because my mom and my step dad is sick. 
a3Kg49EUGkNFwMThWwxmVcPHZL63	I cannot wait to get my own apartment. So my brother can stay with me. 
a3Kg49EUGkNFwMThWwxmVcPHZL63	What made me the happiest today?  was being with Maddie Bevins and  getting to let some things out. 
a3Kg49EUGkNFwMThWwxmVcPHZL63	People not being able to tell me that I'm not doing good enough in life because of where I'm at currently.

I spoke to my brother who is very depressed because his wife passed away and it's the first New Year's he spends by himself.  Jason decided that he's going to dig deep or deeper.  Into having land in Cooperstown right next to us.  So he's happy.  And we decided that we were going to do dream boards, which I think is a very positive thing to do. Hopefully he will let me do it with him and we actually do them cuz I think it's very important.

aUXDKhHDgsaiBmvgyDn7wgvujEJ3	Just a pep. Talk about a heartbreak. 
aUXDKhHDgsaiBmvgyDn7wgvujEJ3	I want to see the first time I wondered if I was supposed to come out here at all. 
aUXDKhHDgsaiBmvgyDn7wgvujEJ3	Today is interesting. I am it's Monday and it's a long weekend. So I don't know there's something about weekends and long weekends and you know time off from work that kind of gets to me. I feel like  I miss my Zoe. I miss my daughter I miss.  Toya I miss my family, you know, I'm in a different city a different state  Just away from everything that I know, you know, even the gym or the church I used to go to is not here anymore. They're so it's just starting a whole new life with no one.  And I'm just getting anxious because I really want.  So here and until you're here and you know mine I don't want to wait for them to be here to feel happy or grateful for this new career opportunity.  I'm so grateful for that, but I'm just so  overwhelmed with the loneliness Rihanna's 
aUXDKhHDgsaiBmvgyDn7wgvujEJ3	I think that's why I feel sad cuz I didn't really have a to-do list because I don't have my car here. I don't really know how to get around. I'm a little nervous to be out there by myself. So I didn't really know how much I could do with in a hotel room. 
aUXDKhHDgsaiBmvgyDn7wgvujEJ3	I guess I was able to spend some good time with my older sister and give her a pep talk. She's not feeling too good knowing that she confide in me to speak to me makes me feel bad about being our relationship and knowing that I have, you know, someone I could talk to. 
aV0faJ1eFSP0448yikzUiObD3Ll2	Being healthy and considerate 
aV0faJ1eFSP0448yikzUiObD3Ll2	I want to be considerate and thoughtful 
aV0faJ1eFSP0448yikzUiObD3Ll2	I didn’t drink the night before and slept well. 
aWOmriBRkjPhKk09FJ10Sy8ok6Y2	I was on the App Store looking for a journal app and found Inwords 
aYZVND8xNVPQpMBlychHxsVx8vu2	there is something that I enjoy doing and nursing school is something that I have a Caring Heart for 
aYZVND8xNVPQpMBlychHxsVx8vu2	My name is Caitlin Cortez.  I come.  I reside in Kansas City, Kansas.  travel Junkie  I'm really bad at making decisions and I make irrational decisions. Don't always do the best thing for myself.  But I'm a good person and I have a good heart. 
aYZVND8xNVPQpMBlychHxsVx8vu2	I think so many things could be different for me and my life right now, but because of my rational decision-making I am where I am right now. 
aYZVND8xNVPQpMBlychHxsVx8vu2	Getting my shit together getting a car a place to live. I'm really looking forward to getting myself to stability. 
aYZVND8xNVPQpMBlychHxsVx8vu2	Work was long. I worked a 16-hour shift and people kind of pissed me out and I've been thinking a lot about situations going on in my life and how it's going to change. 
aYZVND8xNVPQpMBlychHxsVx8vu2	Today was supposed to be my last day at work. I was supposed to cover a mini shift. I couldn't find a ride. So I didn't go I moved back to Kansas City on Friday this morning. I'm feeling a little iffy because I mean I woke up and me and my brother have been arguing since I've been up. We finally got some snow down here today. That's cool. 
aYZVND8xNVPQpMBlychHxsVx8vu2	I mean, I'm still young so I have time but  I'm getting this job that doesn't require either or so. I have then to make the choice, but I'm torn between which I want to do because I want to do both. 
aYZVND8xNVPQpMBlychHxsVx8vu2	Honestly, I think going back to Kansas City could kill me or make me stronger but being here. I'm just so sad. I feel away from home and people that I care about even though I am here and surrounded by people I care about I don't feel wanted. 
aYZVND8xNVPQpMBlychHxsVx8vu2	Whether I should go to nursing school or cosmetology school. 
aYZVND8xNVPQpMBlychHxsVx8vu2	I would tell her to follow her heart, but she can only make that decision for herself because that's her lifelong career. 
aYZVND8xNVPQpMBlychHxsVx8vu2	Probably but I made the choice anyways. 
aYZVND8xNVPQpMBlychHxsVx8vu2	That I need to find myself. 
aYZVND8xNVPQpMBlychHxsVx8vu2	I really don't know how to answer that. 
aYtsTWW2MHVBd9u81YHLcig2ik92	I would say I’m very awkward and have a weird sense of humor but I am very kind and care about others above myself almost all of the time. I am a mom of two and always exhausted

aYtsTWW2MHVBd9u81YHLcig2ik92	Being a positive thinker is an important part of who I am and who I’m becoming 
aYtsTWW2MHVBd9u81YHLcig2ik92	Hard day with joe and the kids weren’t the best listeners just makes things harder when the day started off how it did

agRv0eM98aWRSbrJxgfSyRrabxu1	You're so silly. It's my job. They're the ones that give me PTO. 
agRv0eM98aWRSbrJxgfSyRrabxu1	Good question today. I'm eagerly awaiting to feel better.  And to take a nice little stroll down to the R Bar. 
agRv0eM98aWRSbrJxgfSyRrabxu1	My mother 100% cuz she's always been there for me and my mom struggles every day, but she still continues to go and I love that about her. 
agRv0eM98aWRSbrJxgfSyRrabxu1	I would have to say in medicine. I'm grateful for technology that helps us read people's oxygen levels blood pressure levels. We have been more accurate screen giving medications do to computers and AI. 
agRv0eM98aWRSbrJxgfSyRrabxu1	Honestly, I'm not into holidays. I believe it's a hoax and it's just society's way of trying to get us to buy stuff. Therefore. I do not indulge in it. I believe every day should be quote on quote a holiday. 
agRv0eM98aWRSbrJxgfSyRrabxu1	I'm very grateful for the knowledge of self awareness.  I'm grateful for the knowledge of loving and being patient and understanding others and it's not all about me.  grateful for the knowledge  I'm working with animals medications respiratory rates blood pressure rates CO2 spo2.  I'm glad to have knowledge and relationships and marriage as well. 
agRv0eM98aWRSbrJxgfSyRrabxu1	I'm grateful to be able to experience love loss.  happiness  understanding 
agRv0eM98aWRSbrJxgfSyRrabxu1	I'm very grateful for my room where I live with Christine. I'm very happy at having my own place and one day I will have my own home right now. I have my own little place. I'm grateful for my job. I'm grateful for the park. So grateful for the places of nature where I get to go hike and be one with the breath of the air coming out of the trees and just how we exchange that oxygen nitrogen levels to each other beautiful. 
agRv0eM98aWRSbrJxgfSyRrabxu1	Honestly, I really just want to be here with Aaliyah keep her calm. I'll probably stay here till.  Two or three? I don't know and then I want to go back home and do some yoga and do my laundry. 
agRv0eM98aWRSbrJxgfSyRrabxu1	I enjoy staying present and in the moment. 
agRv0eM98aWRSbrJxgfSyRrabxu1	my positivity and my  challenge to grow everyday 
agRv0eM98aWRSbrJxgfSyRrabxu1	I'm thankful.  remind spiriant  Quest  myself, honestly 
agRv0eM98aWRSbrJxgfSyRrabxu1	Something that inspires me is my best friend Patty.  And it's because she's been through so much and chooses to think positively and I look up to her for that. 
agRv0eM98aWRSbrJxgfSyRrabxu1	Well, I'm not feeling good. So really my only goal is to get better and get rest. 
agRv0eM98aWRSbrJxgfSyRrabxu1	To not be clouded by my emotions and I follow my heart. I knew I couldn't trust him from the beginning and I should have gone with that. So trust my intuition. 
agRv0eM98aWRSbrJxgfSyRrabxu1	We both said we were going to be friends and then he went home and I felt relieved to get him out of my life with my boyfriend. 
agRv0eM98aWRSbrJxgfSyRrabxu1	Went for a walk really nice hike for a couple hours with Aaliyah got to sleep in my bed last night even though I've been dog sitting here with her.  Just been doing meditations and reading my affirmations things like that. 
agRv0eM98aWRSbrJxgfSyRrabxu1	When I found out I started crying because I was so angry and then I already was breaking up with him. So at first we were friends and we were cool. But now that I've thought about it. I don't even want to be his friend like you fucking violated my trust I kept my mouth shut whenever we were cheating.  I never told my husband until he asked me so he can give me the same fucking recognition. 
agRv0eM98aWRSbrJxgfSyRrabxu1	I think it's hard to be positive because we live in such a fake World fake people fake food. We aren't loving the environment taken care of it as we should and that's so incredibly heartbreaking you're treating each other like we should let alone ourselves and it's hard to be surrounded by people who think so negatively. You got to be the change you want to see in the world. 
agRv0eM98aWRSbrJxgfSyRrabxu1	I mean you can do it with your phone on a health app and then you can do it at grocery stores and it's in my job description. So 
agRv0eM98aWRSbrJxgfSyRrabxu1	I heard what I have it.  I didn't go to work, but I'm using my PTO. 
agRv0eM98aWRSbrJxgfSyRrabxu1	I know that's a silly question. Actually. Why would you ask me that? 
agRv0eM98aWRSbrJxgfSyRrabxu1	Know what I said was is I believe every day should be a holiday holidays are just a hoax society's way of getting us to go out and buy bye-bye cause more pollution cause more trash we should just be thankful and joyful everyday. 
agRv0eM98aWRSbrJxgfSyRrabxu1	Okay, so  The reason I'm feeling this way is because I've been thinking more and more about my break-up with Josh and when I was explaining that to a girlfriend, she actually brought it to my attention that he did cross my boundaries fight talking with his ex-girlfriend and another woman and another person experiences that I've been through with my ex-husband.  He had absolutely no right to talk about what I have been through with another woman to have her judge me. He should have kept his fucking mouth shut and never talked about me to someone else if you want to express his emotions. She was not the fucking person to do it with especially about me. That's what fucking makes me love it. I feel disrespected.  Because I told him from the beginning so I'm live it now because I'm finally recognized it and I want to go the fuck off on him, but he's not worth my fucking imagery of anything. I just want to ignore him. But right now he's telling me happy New Year. Fucking know it leave me the fuck alone.

arT9oeuTKyW2pzEbzakQVwQdPHG3	The things we did on our vacations. 
arT9oeuTKyW2pzEbzakQVwQdPHG3	Why I got I did not understand that. 
arT9oeuTKyW2pzEbzakQVwQdPHG3	My relationship with my sister my relationship with myself.  my relationship with my son  even though I've lost relationships and had to let some relationships go last year.  The ones that I'd still do have have become richer Fuller stronger and closer. 
arT9oeuTKyW2pzEbzakQVwQdPHG3	I guess I realized that Brett is not going to be the one for me.  I miss Trey a lot.  I missed Denver extremely a lot. He's in Thailand now or close to Thailand by now. You should be getting there anytime I think in the morning he'll get there.  so  I knew thoughts were.  just sad 
arT9oeuTKyW2pzEbzakQVwQdPHG3	I feel very strongly that I need to get marijuana out of my life completely.  At least start the process go 3 months into it, maybe even a year and see if there's any change in my health.  and in my thoughts in my depression in the different things, I've been suffering from I feel like it's probably holding me down a lot more than I've  admitted 
arT9oeuTKyW2pzEbzakQVwQdPHG3	See my friends.  talking to them  learning how their vacations went  and sharing  our feelings 
arT9oeuTKyW2pzEbzakQVwQdPHG3	Going to the Al-Anon meeting at 7 tonight with my aunt. 
arT9oeuTKyW2pzEbzakQVwQdPHG3	Nothing at all. My sister invited me over to her house for New Year's Day Menudo.  I may go over but I'm still sick. So I'll probably stay home and once again trying to get better.  I'm looking forward to the time to recover today and will probably just watch movies all day. 
arT9oeuTKyW2pzEbzakQVwQdPHG3	My whole day was pretty mediocre. 
arT9oeuTKyW2pzEbzakQVwQdPHG3	I was still feeling very very sick and hadn't been getting any better and then my friend Brett told me I needed to go to the pharmacy and get a z-pack.  at strong antibiotic pack  and take that so that it would knock this cold out of my system. So my sister went and got me the z-pack and brought it over and I started taking it today. So hopefully this cold will start to go away soon or flu whatever it is. 
arT9oeuTKyW2pzEbzakQVwQdPHG3	Yes, I was being on vacation and being sick. I didn't have a lot of goals, but I did want to be able to see my son and also I made half a dozen tamales for my neighbors and took them over to them for helping me get into my house after locking myself out on New Year's Eve day yesterday. 
arT9oeuTKyW2pzEbzakQVwQdPHG3	I only left the house to get food. 
arT9oeuTKyW2pzEbzakQVwQdPHG3	I didn't really accomplished a whole lot today because I'm still recovering but I was able to talk to my sister about her daughter-in-law who is in the hospital.  It was pretty stressful for a while until we realize that she may have meningitis which is totally curable.  I was also able to  schedule time with friends  for next weekend 
arT9oeuTKyW2pzEbzakQVwQdPHG3	the fact that it wasn't  a  unsurmountable health issue that Chelsea is dealing with  I'm thankful that.  She's young and healthy and able to fight off.  Whatever this viruses that attacking her brain.  I'm also grateful for the health of my family.  And for the fact they have resources and that they can do what they need to do. Take care of themselves. I'm so grateful for that.  I'm grateful for my sister that I have grown closer with.  over the past year 
arT9oeuTKyW2pzEbzakQVwQdPHG3	a better relationship with my sister  We're much closer and stronger.  In our relationship. It's a lot deeper than it's ever been.  My confidence and being able to live alone.  Happily or reasonably happily.  I'm grateful for those things. 
arT9oeuTKyW2pzEbzakQVwQdPHG3	I need to get my car washed. I need to make some returns at Kohl's and Costco.  And pick up a few things at the grocery store. The biggest party today is to get to the Al-Anon meeting at 7 tonight with my aunt. I would really like to start in the Al-Anon program and I think it would be very beneficial so far. I have not part took.  Around Christmas and I'm very proud of myself. 
arT9oeuTKyW2pzEbzakQVwQdPHG3	We will probably go for that today since it's the end of our vacation. We'll all probably talk about things. We did in the things we didn't get to do today. 
arT9oeuTKyW2pzEbzakQVwQdPHG3	That's a very difficult question.  spending time with Denver  and also  hearing that Noelle refers to me as Denver's mom.  And that she's still very very angry at me and that she was in town. This last week was Peyton and of course I didn't.  Sierra hear from her  so that was  pretty memorable 
arT9oeuTKyW2pzEbzakQVwQdPHG3	Well, I am sick and she's very worried and that's part of the reason why she made me do. I think which is the sweetest thing she could have done.  Bandidos very healthy and always helps me feel better. 
auUS4l8DlMWblyP9AkCc2FKbhpU2	I honestly don't know what this question. I don't know how to answer the phone. Sorry. 
auUS4l8DlMWblyP9AkCc2FKbhpU2	He's already dead. He died a long time ago. 
auUS4l8DlMWblyP9AkCc2FKbhpU2	I don't know how to answer this either. 
auUS4l8DlMWblyP9AkCc2FKbhpU2	Let me think new jobs.  Feel like throat be jobs for people with like new technology and I don't know. I feel like there will be less jobs too. Since there will be Roblox robots and stuff me tank cuz I took a lot of jobs would disappear.  Honestly, I don't know I'm trying to think I can only think of jobs that wouldn't be around cuz I think we would have liked lots of new technology and microbots and stuff for that. 
auUS4l8DlMWblyP9AkCc2FKbhpU2	I'm honestly just looking for somebody who accept me for who I am. I might sound cheesy.  I've got I've got a lot of problems. I'm not very physically pleasing to look at.  And I'm kind of a piece of shit sometimes.  So you're not too many good qualities. 
auUS4l8DlMWblyP9AkCc2FKbhpU2	I saw it on the app store when I was looking for a diary app to use. 
auUS4l8DlMWblyP9AkCc2FKbhpU2	One reason is that I'm still in school. I can't move really do anything drastic. Like I just want to leave the country or like do something stupid.  Like waste money. I don't know.  I think another reason.  If I'm just lazy and don't have what it takes mentally to really do anything at the moment.  That's all I got.  I'm just sad. 
auUS4l8DlMWblyP9AkCc2FKbhpU2	I watch the hate U give and then there was a really sad scene where little kid was pointing a gun at this dude named King that was really sad that the kid had the gun was pointing at it at the dude because kids shouldn't have guns or I mean, well, yeah and they shouldn't Point them at dude's house at 8 food. 
auUS4l8DlMWblyP9AkCc2FKbhpU2	Got out of bed everyday at some point.  I  made friends at school. I really want to have lots of friends.  So I have a couple that I like.  now there is that I'm not too fond of  I was able to mostly go to school.  And don't miss that many days. I don't think I do miss a lot more days than I did last year.  so that wasn't good but  Yeah. 
auUS4l8DlMWblyP9AkCc2FKbhpU2	I think that the world would probably overpopulate more cuz back in the day people have died from colds and because of pneumonia and stuff. So yeah, I feel like we get overpopulated and we'd have way more people than we have right now since nobody would die as easily if you can or you know, I mean not saying that cuz cuz you can still if you get sick. It's pretty treatable. I mean depends on it what it is cuz nobody got sick. We live so much longer, and I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing. 
auUS4l8DlMWblyP9AkCc2FKbhpU2	I feel like the Earth was flat.  I would just  yeah, I don't know how to answer the Caesar. 
auUS4l8DlMWblyP9AkCc2FKbhpU2	So to start off.  I woke up right and I just realized I didn't I just die in my sleep. So I don't have to wake up, you know.  And then I was hungry and there wasn't much to eat. So I just ate a bunch of crackers, right and it wasn't that great of a day and it was kind of a waste cuz I did absolutely nothing and wasted a Saturday and it just wasn't  It wasn't great. And I'm sad because I wish it was better and I wish I did something and my skin was also really itchy but isn't it always and then like, yeah. 
auUS4l8DlMWblyP9AkCc2FKbhpU2	Joker that movie kind of mentally scarred me because I'm like only 13 when I watched it. It just made me feel so many like Dad emotions and through the whole movie. I just didn't want to look at the screen, but I was in a movie theater, and I didn't want to leave.  But yeah, I'll be kind of and also made me sad.  To watch like and it put me in a really bad mood in general, which isn't very good. I don't think  I also there's a lot of movies that stay with me for like a day or two that one really stayed with me like that stuck with me.  Oh.  Yeah. 
auUS4l8DlMWblyP9AkCc2FKbhpU2	that  I was able to not spend too much time on my bed doing nothing.  That I didn't really feel that depressed today.  That's good. 
auUS4l8DlMWblyP9AkCc2FKbhpU2	I want to live.  I don't know. Honestly, I think I'd want to live here cuz there's so many opportunities and jobs and we keep all this place is full of different cool exciting different races different ethnicities people different ideologies.  But also for water fun things you can do in places you can visit.  So yeah, I think I'm good with know where I am in America, you know the USA is pretty cool, you know. 
auUS4l8DlMWblyP9AkCc2FKbhpU2	This is really fun question. Actually, I feel like I just go to the Victorian age and just look at all the fancy dresses.  All the food and all the people even if they're really only rich people and if even if the place probably smelled bad, look at all the fancy dresses and what the rich Victorian women wore, you know also be cool to go back in the day and meet Van Gogh.  So I could be fun to see him.  and  what he looks like and what the hell he'd act if I asked him questions I bet he'd be a bit eccentric if you know what I mean. 
auUS4l8DlMWblyP9AkCc2FKbhpU2	I honestly have no clue how old banjo is.  Beacon because he died when he was young. I think he died when he was 30. So I think he was like  31 he died. I don't know exactly what this question is asking me. 
auUS4l8DlMWblyP9AkCc2FKbhpU2	Because it's cold and dry and your allergies come out in the winter. I think I have allergies me myself. I have allergies all year round which suck but I mean my skin gets tired. I don't know if that has anything to do with the question though. 
auUS4l8DlMWblyP9AkCc2FKbhpU2	Not really.  I was just not feeling that great cuz I usually don't really feel great in the first place. But soon it wasn't even that bad. I think I felt decent hell, okay. 
auUS4l8DlMWblyP9AkCc2FKbhpU2	I don't work.  So I can't answer that question. 
avRitNSsCQNdPUzzW5qDNmI0VdE2	Searched for journal in App Store

avRitNSsCQNdPUzzW5qDNmI0VdE2	I am thinking that my husband doesn't really care about me or my feelings after our discussion today.

b60fmcpwzheomfsXRTtHoHrSUsf1	To see their face light up when getting something new 
b60fmcpwzheomfsXRTtHoHrSUsf1	I’m passionate about my kids, I love doing  things with my kids. I love shopping 
b60fmcpwzheomfsXRTtHoHrSUsf1	How to stay calm in situations that may trigger my anxiety 
b60fmcpwzheomfsXRTtHoHrSUsf1	I would like to pay off my credit, save money and move into a house
b60fmcpwzheomfsXRTtHoHrSUsf1	The feeling of accomplishment. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	I didn't dream about that. I dream that somebody was trying to kill me and I was living in somebody else's house. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	I don't know because of my spelling. My mom said it was a unique way because you didn't want to tell Mexican. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	It just means a few.  If you like if your teacher has to do with paper and she says it's homework. Well, let's say it's 15 minutes and I'm already on plug number 5 and there is this one kid in class that's not paying attention to the work he has to do and he's messing around with his friends. Will he hasn't even written his name?  NYX the name with 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	Kids cannot some other kids in my class. They cannot go the same speed as me.  Play Quinn. Seriously, if I'm on problem number three, they haven't even wrote in your name on the paper. I don't think it's their fault at all. I do not blame them or anyting but I think if they pay attention in class like I do and listen every single word, my teacher says and pay attention to the problems have some look back at the problems that pay attention that they can they can be easily like me and they could get straightening and they could have a better grade and you know, it doesn't mean I didn't kids at my school when they think of like the smart kids. They think oh, well, they don't get to hang out with their friends, but we do just because we're smart and we study  Does that mean we don't get to have fun? It means we get to have more fun because we get our work done return it in. We have more time to have fun. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	I think some people hurt usually because  they build a protective layer around themselves.  A fake layer so that they don't get hurt but they just end up being hurt more.  because I'm  they don't trust themselves. So yeah, they don't. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	I don't get too because I'm I sometimes I'm afraid because I want to be just like my sister and I want to be a perfectionist and if I don't get something done did I have a nightmare about it? And I think I'm going to be toast or I'm going to think I'm going to be killed by my teachers or Mom. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	I think I wake up the same way because after the song is because you know, I like the music gets in my head and I know the music and want to sing it and I want to dance to it. So I want to just like start moving and wiggling and dancing. So yeah, I think that's why. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	It doesn't matter how it spelled because I am Mexican to doesn't really matter if I filled it with a you or find yesterday and dren had it Aundrea. She thought she thought it sounded like Andrea when you spell and are you so she used a u n d r e a that makes Aundrea. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	Well, you know every morning when I wake up I am super tired super super super tired, but I created this morning routine and the first couple things help me like wake up. Like I listen to some music the music gets my like my energy going and I just want to dance and it gives my energy up so that way I can I'm up and ready. I'm not sleeping. So that is pretty good. I always wake up the same way. I always wake up listening to music dancing, you know, and then I call myself. I don't like okay. Okay after the fourth song I'm done because I can't listen to anymore and I got to start getting ready and I do some meditation because it's good for your soul. And then sometimes I chat with you grab me in the morning because it's good to see express your feelings. And then I hop in the shower I get dressed as I've already took a shower the last night and I Yeah, that's what I always do every day. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	Mom I got feelings about college is I really wanted you both so I can't really make a decision because I do really want to go to study hard and I want to get into a good college so that way I can get a good job my job. I don't know because I think it's so boring that you just do the same routine throughout your life. Like okay when I wake up and take a shower and my dress I'm going to work and do the same thing every single day. I think that's kind of boring and my school about college again. I think I want to do both. I want to have fun with my friends, but I also want to study a lot and make sure I'm good with a good college. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	A few of my ideas are being excited that even if I get like a b or a c being excited that I didn't get an F. You know, it's not that big of a deal. You know, I only missed a couple and I need to start saying well, I'll I'll study more next time and I'll make sure I get those questions right? I can't make myself. I can't go into the past and change it. So all I have to look forward to is the future as going to make sure I study for the next test. I got to make sure I know that question by heart, you know, and another idea is Criticism it's also another way. I can stop myself from criticizing myself is by.  Will think it's okay. I'm going to try to do better or I'm going to try to work harder or saying.  It's okay. You know, I I know I did something wrong, but I'm going to try to be a better person or I'm going to try to try harder on the next past or I'm going to trying to do better. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	Well so far is Dame.  What is been overly emotional day?  because my dad kind of made me upset because  he wants me to express my feelings more.  But I don't like expressing my feelings. I like expressing them to myself cuz I don't really know how to share with anybody else, but I don't know if anybody's going to get mad or sad me so. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	I am very passionate about school. I think education is a big part of my life one day. I will hopefully get a good education in like I'm a high school and I don't get to go to a good college and hopefully I can become a teacher one day so I can help kids like me and you know, I helped him go to college and have a good education and I think that's something I'm very passionate about. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	a new idea or thought  Was Brightwood and woke up? I thought I would like refresh my brain, you know, don't think about all the past. I want to start a new day today. No, I'm I'm looking forward to the future. I'm looking forward to tomorrow. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	I would like to feel more motivated for do my work. I'm always have to be motivated for that. So that way I can get it done and I also want to be motivated to workout and to go on a date because I think it's super important that I do and yeah because I wanted to call Mary I don't want to be no judge for being really fat when I grow up. So yeah, that's what I'm really looking motivated for and that's what I want to be motivated. I also want to be motivated everyday to go to school and see my friends know. I need to feel more motivated and more. More positive in myself my self-confidence. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	Probably when I come home from school and I get to get some sleep because I am I'm like really really really tired. But if that doesn't count then I'd be really am I'm looking forward, you know to on sing my friends in a couple hours, you know, and probably see my family after I come home and then of course getting sleep. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	Incredibly thankful for my mom. Definitely. She please raise me. She she make sure I have food and she makes tribal Waters make sure is closed and there's any good education needed and  she also she gives me a life in a purpose and she gives me indicating they want and I also I also love my dad dearly. He loves me with all his heart and I'm just very thankful for them. And I'm also thankful for my brother and sister and my dogs are dogs. They help me like when I feeling sad when I'm feeling mad or sad at either my mom if I'm bad at all of them like fun sad or mad at my my dad my mom my brother my sister and I got my dogs cuz that would help me. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	A simple pleasure I feel grateful for is I love going to school school. I mean, that's not  Just because my friends I mean my friends are are a big part of my buy education, but they make me want to work more but I love my math and my reading it love everything like that and I expect really like this one boy names Kian and he is my kind of crush. So 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	My dad my mom my sister and my brother and my dogs because my mom and dad like they gave me everything in this world. They gave me they'd make sure I have food and water hose in a good education and they give me everything I want and I'm so thankful for them. And I'm also thankful for my brothers and sisters because they  they the people I look up to my sister. I just want to be like her so much. She studies all his time to make sure everything is perfect the imperfectionist and I want to be that someday and my brother he is very brave and I want to be very brave like him. He's a very brave person and then yeah and my dogs has helped me get through emotional times and I'm thankful for them because I mean if I'm mad at like everybody in my life, I know that I'm not going to be mad at them because they're like my my babies. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	I think some people perceive me in the wrong way.  Some people think I'm the really really smart glass.  And that I always study I'm always paying attention. I always got everything right and I'm perfect perfect. Perfect. But the truth is I'm not pregnant. No buddy is close to perfect. I'll make mistakes. We all have problems. Also another way. I think some other people perceive me is that I'm like a Scottish. I'm drama queen sometimes I think that is true. That is true partly. So I am okay with that, but I'm trying to be better at that and I think when people bring it up,  It makes me go back and think about it and I don't like it because I'm trying to focus on the future and what's happening right now, and I'm trying to be a better person in the future. And today. I'm not focusing on the past about what they heard from trying to be a better person another way people might perceive me is he might think that  sometimes things might think that I am do you know, I'm rude, okay.  Because it is their opinion. I have no their you're entitled to their opinion. I think it's very rude if they think that I'm ruining their tell me because I know there's some people who tell me it. I'm okay, it's fine. It's just that I would rather you had evidence to support why I'm being rude and you know, maybe I can explain it to you, you know. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	"No not really maybe my dad or mom

"
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	I am looking forward for my birthday and my holidays and I'm looking for my niece or nephew to be born. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	well  It's I've been on an extreme roller coaster today at the beginning of the day. I was sad and throughout the whole day. I am still sad, but I was sad and mad at one point. I was kind of sad and happy I was sad because my dog is dying. I'm sad and mad because my dog is dying and there's this one girl at school Gracie and  She keeps hurting my feelings and I don't like that and it makes me angry and I was sad and happy also because my dog is dying and I was happy because today was my choir practice and mrs. Hagaman. My music teacher said I did something perfectly during my song. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	Some of my qualities I like our I'm a very hard worker. I'm not going to stop until I know it. I'm not I'm not going to stop studying. I'm not going to stop doing something until I'm shirts done. You know, another quality. I like about myself is that I'm willing to share I think sharing is a big part of life because some people don't share with you. In my opinion that is kind of rude because they won't share with me but the moment they need something. Oh now it's okay to share and always share if somebody doesn't have something I give it to them because maybe they're not as fortunate as I am. Maybe they don't have as much money or maybe they don't have what I have, you know, and I think some other kids that like laugh at them for not having what I have. I think that is wrong because We are not all the same. We don't all have the same thing like some people and the world.  Don't have a mom.  So maybe you could share mom, you know, maybe you know, you can make your best friend's mom.  I'm at your best friend who doesn't have a mom.  Let her like use your mom or her mom because it kind of makes her feel bad. She doesn't have a mom. You know, it's okay to share because everybody is not the same you don't all have the same things. Like maybe one guy has pink scissors. Maybe sometimes have any scissors or some guys.  Scissors and this one guy really wants a pair of blue scissors.  Only just going to take a pink scissors. Hahaha. I think that's very rude to do that. So I would always share and another good quality or thing. I like about myself.  ISM sometimes that all the time not saying I'm perfect. I am willing to share my mistakes.  And what I have done something not all the time because there's so much I have not shared with everybody.  But I think that I think to myself. I don't really tell anybody about it. I think to myself. Okay. I really did this and I really messed up and I shouldn't have done that.  And that was a huge mistake, but I should have done that at all. There was no reason for it.  Song I say to myself, but tomorrow is a different day. I'm going to try to be a better person and try not to do that ever again.  And I'm willing to tell myself. Yeah, I did that. I'm taking responsibility for it for myself. I'm taking responsibility for myself. I did something wrong.  I'm going to tell myself K. I did something wrong. I should have done that. I'm not going to do that. Again. Another thing. I like about myself is on. I think I am pretty unfriendly, you know, and I'm pretty funny.  I think  I always like a good laugh. I mean I do like my school and I like my education, but then it's time for lunch and it's time for recess and I like having fun with my friends and laughing and giggling and hahaha. You know, it's funny. I like about myself is I like to do crafts and I think I'm very crafty and I think that makes me kind of unique because not a most people are like that some people are just like, okay I'ma go on Google Now, I'm going to know Amazon. I'm not going to buy that.  For the centerpiece, but I think it would be nice to make your own centerpiece. Do it DIY know maybe you could surprise yourself. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	something unique about me is  I love school work and I also have my own kind of style. I guess, you know, I  I read Harry Potter books. That's one way of thinking unique I am.  I like being on do you know?  I like being very scheduled very Forsyth and I also  I think something very unique about me that not a lot of people do is I I really enjoy doing like crafts and I always think of myself that I'm going to be a famous YouTuber. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	Unwell right now. I'm going to go to my daddy daughter dance. And yeah it is I really want to know if your crush likes me back and I hear saying my name wrong, it's not Andrea. It's Aundrea. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	I guess I think it's um, I struggle sometimes I don't sometimes I'm like Mom Mom and sometimes I get it I get it. She's a busy mom and she has to call Express to clean but sometimes I give her my papers and maybe I got a hundred a hundred on my brand new test that was worth like 50% of my grade. She's like she's just like good job, sweetie. And I'm I think I kind of deserve more but I don't really tell her.  I don't want her to feel bad cuz she does work hard another way, I struggle and celebrating. My success is sometimes I do not think I'm good enough. Like if I got like a B+ on my paper and then I got like on  95 out of a hundred. I feel really bad. I feel I should be gotten better school or I should have studied harder. I should have known better, you know, and that's actually some parents would say that is a pretty good score, but I think I push myself above the limit. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	I don't get what you mean. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	The most important thing is I can be very emotional. I get hurt really easily not just physically but emotionally 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	well today I woke up and I got excited cuz I was going to school like I always do and  yeah, they were some like moments of my day and like my day.  I think probably my best part of my day was I got to see my dad because I don't get to see my dad very often. But yeah, me and my sister and my dad who went out all to eat and you know, I'm also excited about seeing my mom cuz I love my mom. I see her everyday though, but and  I saw my friends, but there was one part. I got really mad and my day.  Turns out I have the eye of the saying in my school acquire and I'm a choir student and we have a contest and we had to sing a song and we've been practicing the songs from now, I think one week and it turns out that Dylan has the same song as me and it makes me really mad because Taylor knew that was already my song and that if he chose it he knew oh, well I'm going to prove is a better singer. I don't want that kind of competition, you know.  I don't want that much pressure saying me between dalen know. I'm just feel better if he wins. You know, I'm going to feel oh my God, I'm not as good as a singer stanlin, you know, I should probably look up doing more because he's such a great singer. Wish I was him. That's no fair. But I also know I'm going to be mad at myself if I win because I feel that we have the same song. So it doesn't really matter about the song it just matters about like our vocal folds and how he's singing and if I win I feel bad for daylon, so I'm up in a tight situation and tomorrow we have to share a choir practice and that's not the most comfortable feeling to hear your opponent song like demons going to listen to How I seeing I'm going to listen now he sings 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	Something I did today was I let myself relax a little bit more. I'm usually just so straight up. You know, I'm always focused on my work. I want everything everything every element of what I supposed to be. Perfect. And I'm today, I guess I realized that nobody's perfect. I mean, we're all human and it's okay to make mistakes along the way and that's I relax myself as I pictured in my mind that we're not all perfect. We all have flaws we all have you no mistakes. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	I dream took place in most likely like most mainly it place in a stranger's house. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	I one day want to revisit.  Want to revisit probably even though my dad, but I think that they are incredible people in their Heartbreakers. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	Well, I have to get ready and I'm just like I always do I'm making a morning Christine and I always flower of the morning routine and I check what I have done if I don't have something done, but timer I go to school will then I need to get that done or go to school.  Play also another to-do list is I really need to like start needing every single night. It needs to become a habit the oldies every single night and I'll do all my work every single night. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	I want to work on getting my task might like my little task done, you know every day I come home. I'm like, okay, I got read I got to finish my song. I got to practice my spelling bee I got to draw I got to do this and that and I put too much pressure on myself and then I forget about it and then I don't do it and then I didn't do anything and then the next day like okay I got to do it today and I don't do it in the next day I got to do today. I normally do it today want to do it straight when I get home and I don't do it. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	I think my mom will definitely help me on the input. But I think it's all totally ultimately my choice my decision and I really want to know to make a decision on those two things. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	What did the Dow deadlines are?  So many many many years I think about so right now I'm 10 about to be 11. So I probably say about 9 10 9 8 9 and 10 years 8 9 and 10 years from now. That's the deadline. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	Palm lately, I have been lacking confidence because you know, I don't believe in myself as much I don't think good about myself as much as I think when you have confidence, you have to feel good about yourself sometimes in my grades at school. I don't feel enough confidence as good enough. Maybe I get a c I feel like I should have done better. I should have studied more. I should have studied harder. I'm going to get so much trouble by myself because I don't know but I think I should be trying to say okay. I tried it. This is K. I didn't make it. It's okay, you know, I still got a pretty good score and maybe next time I'll try even harder to study really hard for that question. Another way is I don't.  I don't let people.  See my feelings.  Because I'm not sure what people would think of my feelings. I think that they would judge me. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	And I ain't think I'm lacking confidence because I think sometimes I don't tell people what my life is like because I don't think they're going to judge me on it. I think that they're going to tear me down with it and they're going to make me feel bad about it.  Like if I was let say I'm poor.  But what is ever going to think of Maita and gesture for a little girl that doesn't have any money. I mean, I think I have some low confidence in myself because there's some qualities in myself that I do not like because people might judge me on them. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	I want to be able to live.  Without food and water of course, but I want to be able to live without my family and everybody else's family. I mean, they're a big part of this world and what they do isn't important and  I think I can't live without my friends my family and other families and I couldn't live without my dog. My dogs are huge heart my dogs. I love them. They always come with me. They play with me. They have fun with me. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	Something that brings me joy every day during the weekdays something that brings me joy in the morning is just knowing that I have a good education that other people aren't as fortunate to have so I'm very lucky and grateful and I think that is so awesome that every day I can go to school but I don't think that's as awesome that other kids don't get to get the same opportunities and they can't get jobs like me that I can do in the future and I think that's pretty sad something that brings me joy everyday is my family left thinking about my family. My family loves me. I love them. You know, we kind of just go with the flow. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	I think if you're a good person.  I do not believe there is an entirely perfect person but there is a good person. So a good person isn't perfect. They don't have to be a Perfection. They don't have to be the most beautiful the most smartest the most grateful, you know, they make mistakes, you know, they are not perfect. But what are some good traits and good qualities that they need Sabika person is definitely I think is being respectful to  Here older brothers or sisters or parents or teachers or just like anybody that is helping you or and I also think a good person is very kind and he is willing to help he or she is willing to help somebody no matter what? No, they put  There needs last and everybody else's needs first. I also think that a good person, you know doesn't try to make others feel bad. They care about everybody. They don't want anybody to have a good like have their feelings hurt and they just really care and they're loving two people. There are good worker. I mean they don't like  They don't like quit school. They they keep on pushing their enthusiastic there. I go getters and they're trying to push people and saying you got this you got this trying to keep them in a positive mood and I think that would be a really good person. And I also think that be good person you really really really really really really need.  2  Use your heart.  Will you do need to use your brain, but sometimes your heart is better than your brain because your heart has so much love in it and I think that's a very good trait. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	I think my answer that I just gave you was totally right. I mean some people might perceive me in that way and it's okay. They perceive me in that way some other like my friends see me as a nice girl, you know, but I don't know. I don't know what they're thinking. I can't read their minds. Maybe they're talking about me behind my back saying I'm rude and selfish.  But I don't know. I don't know how other people might perceive me.  I would think that sometimes yes, I am rude and sometimes yes, I am helpful and I do try to learn from my mistakes and I know yeah. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	My feelings and actions would definitely change a lot.  If there was no fear in my life or knowing that people would not judge me.  my feelings  I would be more Brave I would feel more confident. I wouldn't care what they would say because they're they're not going to judge me and then there's not going to be as much pressure on me, and I'm not going to worry about what they think. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	I think that it would definitely change If I Was Not Afraid of Anything, I mean anything or I didn't doubt that somebody wasn't going to like me.  I wouldn't be so worried or I wouldn't be so beautiful or so nervous all the time thinking of what other people are going to think of me. That is definitely a big thing if there was less doubt and fear my life. I would not worry as much like, you know, I wouldn't have as much nervous energy or fuel for a fearful energy. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	I want to taste not like coffee, but I wanted to taste like a different lots of drinks combined like maybe some soda with some Jews that some little bit of water, you know with some of like memes like something exciting like that like coffee. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	I'm trying to make a decision in my lifestyle. You know what I want to be when I grow up. I know I'm just a little kid, but I think it's super important to know what I want to be but I want to be multiple things. You know, I just want to be one thing one boring thing my whole life and do the same thing every day. You want to do different things. I want to be a baker. I wanna be a fashion designer. I want to be a teacher or be a judge. I want to help people, you know, I want to be different things and I really want to know what I'm going to be also. I wanted to make a decision in my lifestyle. No Dua. I know you could do both but I want to focus on one so I hang out with my friends and have fun that also do my work or do I just concentrate really hard on my work and get them? All right, you know and make sure I pay attention in class so that way I can get into a good school or college and those are some of the biggest attractions in my life right now. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	Well, I found out the boy. I like like me back. So that was pretty cool. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	My favorite moment was when I found out the way as I can crack. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	I will tell them listen to your heart and that is okay. If you decide to study more because you know, I'm always going to be here and want to get into college. I'm going to say congratulations, you know, because that is a great opportunity for you. I don't want to take away the opportunity just because you want to be my friend, you know.  I know you're going to have friend. You still can you still can have friends and hang out? But just not as much you know, and that's a great choice the great opportunity for you, and I don't want to take that opportunity away from you. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	Well so far. My day has been going to greatest went to school.  Today and one of my friends is mad at me and one of my friends talk behind my back. So I really got mad and upset. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	As of right now I feel guilty.  Pahrump  my my dad breaking up with my stepmom. I feel very guilty about that. I think that was partly me and my my fault I'm also guilty.  That I've told a lot of lies people. I know that might have hurt them and I'm sorry about that. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	Well something that Spanish.  Getting my curiosity is if my crush likes me back. So I want to learn about how to love him if he loves me. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	I don't get your question. Can you repeat it again in different words? 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	Well, my dad didn't really get a good education. He grew up in Mexico in Aguascalientes in  he didn't really have a lot of money in Mexico and that is very sad for him.  But he didn't learn how to do math really really really good and he actually taught me most of the math. I know and today I know a lot of laughs so I'm thankful for him to do. But yeah, but my mom and dad divorced so I don't really I see my dad sometimes but not all the time.  So yeah. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	No, I don't think I can.  But the sad part is that one of my dog's is dying and I feel very bad for her.  And I don't want her to. Because I can't live without her very hard.  She does everything she she knows when I'm sad when I'm sad. She always has her little nose into my lap and she always lays with me.  whenever I get scared and  choice make sure everything's right. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	In my opinion you should because there are so many kids out there who don't get a good education who don't give food on the table every day who don't get water who don't get close who don't get a house over their head to don't have everything that I have and I think I'm so thankful for them. And I'm grateful. I actually am and you know some some people like some parents are really mean to their kids, but I am so grateful that I have a nice parent and I wish I could help other kids that don't have parents like mine, but I can't unfortunately but I'm grateful for what they have given me and what they will give me in the future and they're my best friends, I guess. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	Oh, yeah.  I think it's really bad that some kids don't get an education like I do when  they're not as fortunate as I I mean, I cannot blame them cuz I know some kids.  Do you know they say they make fun of the kids that don't learn as fast but I don't think it's their fault my mom. She paid for me to get a tutor and every day and I became knowing all my facts quick quick quick like that, you know, it was easy and all three kids.  Four five steps behind me when I was on Problem by their own problem 1, you know some I think it's some kids go faster than others and you know, you can't blame them. They are not as fortunate as they don't want. They might not have as much money and kids that don't even get to go to school. I feel bad for them cuz you know  an education is great.  I've always talked about I can't I seriously I'm so excited for growing up. Not just because I'm going to be able to go to the bar, you know, but just because you know, I got to go to college and after I get to go to college I'll get a job and I'll get money paid but other kids aren't as fortunate as I am and they don't get that. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	Well actually I have lots of goals I want to finish homework and work out and eat healthy and drink water and also spend some time with my dog
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	Well, I I see myself. I think I'm a very hard worker. I I try really hard.  You know, I try never to give up sometimes sometimes it's your that I do not have some of that positive energy, but I'm going to still try you can do it. You can try and I think that is a very good trait about myself. I'm also think.  I sometimes overthink things and I think I got it what I'm going to do. I don't know what I'm going to do. I don't know the answer and I think I over stressed myself. But if I just calm down, you know and really focus. I think I'm really good. And I think that's amazing with myself that I can overcome a big task like that and another way I kind of see myself is sometimes I see myself as rude because of the way I speak in the way I act and I think other people think that  But I don't really see as much because I think I am pretty helpful and I am really good at communicating with people. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	I'm feeling very proud that I use my app this app because I think it helps me express myself. I don't really express myself to people but you're not a person. I mean you are but you're not like a like a a person person and I think that it helps me get my feelings out and I think that's really good for a person to do and to get their all their emotions and their feelings and everything out so that they're nice rapid it. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	Yeah I guess I can think of just ignoring Gracie you know it’s fine you know just ignore her I guess and I’m just gonna have a good time at school and I’m gonna try doing that and I’m also going to think of my with my dogs dying I’m gonna think of she is in a better place now she’s gonna be in heaven she’s going to be with God in you I know I know by my heart that God is going to take so much better care of her than anything because I trust God and I know he will pull through and that’s why he’s so great you know and yeah
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	I don't think I used all my time wisely. So yeah. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	there is definitely a lot that's contributing that is going into these feelings because  Gracie is why I'm being mad. My dog dying is why I am sad and I'm happy because  I'm doing really good with my song and music. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	Well I was pretty mad today at a kid named Gracie because she was really being mean to me and I think that she shouldn’t because I think about everybody else before I speak to them and I think about what I’m gonna say and you don’t always know what’s happening at home you don’t know if they’re having a hard time right now at home they might not be having food or water or they might not have a family really they might just really want to come to school and have a really good day because at home that’s where it’s tough you know and that’s what’s going on with me I have so much stuff in my life about with my family in school right now is just my happy place so in place I can get my energy out you know I can have fun with my friends and yeah another thing that happened was right now my dog is dying and she is not gonna get any better and I wonder if there was something I could’ve done to prevent that from happening put up for a vet her from dying and it’s really sad to think about because she’s always been there for me always always always always always always been there for me and it’s just hard because I’m gonna miss her so much because I I love her more than anything and I hope she knows that and I don’t think she does it I want I want her to know how much I love her so I’m praying and I’m hoping that God can tell her how much I love her because I love her more than anybody I love her more than anything I love her more than she loves herself I love her to death she is she is the most amazing dog she is so energetic and she was so funny and it’s just really hard time seeing her die
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	I'm excited about being an aunt and I'm excited. I'm going to turn around 11 another year. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	I'm definitely feeling a little bit sad because first off my my dog is dying and it's sad to think about because my dog is going to die tomorrow.  and  after the next morning on Saturday morning, I'm going to get to see her face and I'm not going to get to see her hands or Paws or notes ever again.  gone  She's been with me through everything. She's always been there for me. And I'm worried. There was something that I could have done to prevent this.  Like it was my fault and that's a reason why I'm feeling sad little bit but there's more reasons why I'm a little bit sad, but that that is one of the main reasons. 
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	Well I am feeling a bit blue because my dog is dying and I love her and last week my other dog died in so I’ve been really depressed lately
b7A5BnFowKWNg9pzMAPvktB5b1C2	I'm always grateful to look forward to my family and my school and my education right when I come home from school. I'm always finding my mama told me she just makes me laugh whole bunch and she's she's everything I got. She's so helpful and the same with my brothers and my sisters and my dad if I didn't have my dad. I have nothing me and my dad Bond so much in my sisters and my siblings. I look forward to seeing them because they make me excited. You know, they make me want to kind of be like them. I guess. I also look forward to coming home and seeing my dogs. I love my dogs. Generally. They're like my life. I guess my dogs are such a big part of my life. And I love my dogs and my family and everything, but I love my dogs and a mouse. I always look forward.  In the mornings when I wake up. I look forward to going to school and learning and being like participating in school raising my hand Ali's and making sure I have my math and making sure I have this work.

bi43BMWa2UgiWBsU254HPM740DD2	yes, so  yes, I feel blue.  It's not terrible as it was before.  but  I feel like  I can't seem to  get a hold on things.  And I really really want to I can Envision it in my mind.  how I want things to be very easy to imagine but  then there are times where I just  I almost laughed because  I feel so far away from that.  It makes me feel blue.  unfulfilled expectations of myself

I feel like I dragged her around a little bit too much.  Haven't seen a lot of the friends after.  My grandma died and we had the funeral that was a bit.  Just want a couple lot of time. So kind of lost touch with the friends here.  Things that are new I suppose a really nice thing is my work schedule will be changing.  A little bit.

bi43BMWa2UgiWBsU254HPM740DD2	"Yeah. It was actually quite nice in the beginning. For some reason though it went downhill. I felt like I was losing control of my reactions to things. I don’t like that feeling.
I felt rude and not myself.
And then a workmate got on my nerves.
I didn’t feel good because of bein fatigued and low blood sugar. Finally I was feeling unhappy because I wanted to do more in the day but there never seems to be enough time to do what I want to and should do.
"
bi43BMWa2UgiWBsU254HPM740DD2	Well, I woke up and I wasn't feeling very good. Also, I hadn't slept. Well, I don't think that help the situation at all.  Another thing was I felt like I had use my time poorly yesterday.  And was feeling guilty about that, even though I genuinely did not feel good.  also just  feeling tired and also kind of stuck in my situation waking up on the morning and having nothing really to do almost makes it worse and gives me more time to think about things and overthink and I struggle to keep my thinking stress-free or at least relatively calm when I had don't have anything going on so that didn't help. 
bi43BMWa2UgiWBsU254HPM740DD2	Fairly. I worked and I tidied my house a bit and I ran an errand. 
bi43BMWa2UgiWBsU254HPM740DD2	What do you mean by material possession ?
bi43BMWa2UgiWBsU254HPM740DD2	Yes. I have plans to go see friends out of town. And hopefully it will be fun. I also hope to really diconnnect from the stress that has colored my life for the past few months 
bi43BMWa2UgiWBsU254HPM740DD2	I appreciate my friends I’ll see tomorrow, and those I’ll see at the meeting, friends old and new. And get to be at an English meeting
bi43BMWa2UgiWBsU254HPM740DD2	yes, so I had to go to work and right now I'm actually  time to start my spiritual routine again.  figuring out what to study as a challenge, but  a lot of options  After work, I know I have to.  Do a couple other things but honestly nothing is as pressing in my mind right now. I just have a couple things in my to do list, but I want to crack down on. 
bi43BMWa2UgiWBsU254HPM740DD2	Anxiety depression. I felt very sad. I think the weather was part of it and  general disturbance and malaise was very unpleasant and and I felt like foggy headed. I couldn't navigate clearly Through the Motions. Anyways, you know, I know they were all there, but I couldn't I couldn't I fell out of control. 
bi43BMWa2UgiWBsU254HPM740DD2	I will make healthy decisions for my body today, because it is worth it 
bi43BMWa2UgiWBsU254HPM740DD2	Yes.  when I  I watched the second part of the broadcast that really helped.  I always helps anytime. I put anything spiritual on.  anything of that nature I feel better and then some things that Nina said  that helped it helps a lot. 
bi43BMWa2UgiWBsU254HPM740DD2	There might have been a quick and heart rate, but strangely.  It was on my stomach just too tight stomach and maybe a tight chest.  Often times by heart does race but this time it didn't.  And I just felt that feeling in my gut it was very unpleasant. 
bi43BMWa2UgiWBsU254HPM740DD2	I would like to remind myself to.  pray  to turn my worries into prayers  2 / specifically  for the hell to know what to do about the situation and how to proceed.  not just event to Jehovah but specifically asking for direction and  2  We assess home using my time.  See if there's some kind of  well, there's something spiritual missing which most likely there will be.  I just do that, you know and decide to do something spiritual first before I do something.  before I do something that is  recreational  I don't cut out Rick reasonably link. That's also not reasonable, but  Prioritize the things that will help you be closer to Jehovah and you know that will make you feel better. 
bk7lhZTjauUwC3SGSF7nOQCoNuf1	How do I feel about having to pay taxes? How do I feel about having to pay taxes?  I haven't had to pay taxes. What all your talk. Okay. I asked you okay, like pay taxes like at Walmart and plus tax and all that kind of shit.  I don't hate paying taxes because I know why I don't know where the money really is going to but I know the money goes to somewhere to at least help the state outright. At least. I know that's at hope I know that that's where it's going to at least help the community.  But the thing about taxes that I hate is that they don't just don't add it on to the price. So they put a price out for something but they don't just add on to that price. So when you go buy something and everything, you don't have to worry about having to add in the tax to actually know how much you going to spend at the end of the day at the end of your shopping trip or whatever. 
bk7lhZTjauUwC3SGSF7nOQCoNuf1	I don't know why I didn't bring her out first. I love her. I really do she have.  Some issues and I have issues with some of her issues.

We definitely are we are going through some stresses in life money-wise financially and just all-around that kind of stuff. So yeah, what else? 
bk7lhZTjauUwC3SGSF7nOQCoNuf1	Getting paid more for work getting paid more being able to go out more experience life more with my wife.  Enjoy life more because right now we're just doing nothing.  But yeah, that's what I really hope for this year.

bn9jfGALn5PMVVQIiJVrlpm0X8j2	I think it's because  being a mother  Don't know. It's so hard to describe how being a mother makes you feel makes you feel important and needed and loved unconditionally.  And it allows you to do those things.  Allows you to put a piece of yourself out in the world.  and it's  just indescribably.  Perfect is exhausting and stressful that holding your children and seeing them smile and seeing them happy.  Just gives you a measurable.  Joy 
bn9jfGALn5PMVVQIiJVrlpm0X8j2	I honestly don't know.  maybe writing  I doing some writing might help me to feel confident.  I'm getting long as my kids that typically makes me feel confident because I am confident about being a good mom.  Spending time at the gym. I'm not confident at the gym because I'm not physically where I want to be but it always makes me feel better.  After working out because I know I've taken a step in the right direction. 
bn9jfGALn5PMVVQIiJVrlpm0X8j2	This morning was good the kids behaved and we were on time but then I went to a meeting with the lead team and I was there to take pictures for international women's day and I thought it would be well-received but one leadership personnel, which the group was mostly men.  Had concerns about the pose. We are wanting to do having alternate meeting meanings.  so the entire reason for me going out to this meeting was kind of births by that one person and  I mean, it's understandable just to double-check, but it also kind of made me feel like  Mike  most of our leadership look at me.  A little kid like I'm cute. I don't take me seriously as a professional and that's very frustrating for me in the more. I've thought about it since I've gotten back to my office and more.  I've had a hard time calming down. 
bn9jfGALn5PMVVQIiJVrlpm0X8j2	I'm I'm trying to manage.  Stress and Anxiety level depression so that I can reduce some of the medication and hopefully stop taking medication.  That has helped me.  I'm having panic attacks. 
bn9jfGALn5PMVVQIiJVrlpm0X8j2	I believe people perceive me as quiet may be stuck up stiff dry.  and look at me as if I'm  inferior and not in  Andover way, but maybe talk to me more like I'm a mature or I'm a kid and my stature. I mean they like physically look down at me because I'm so small and my face is very  Young looking so I don't look my age and I feel like people.  Speak to me that way. 
bn9jfGALn5PMVVQIiJVrlpm0X8j2	I'm looking forward to taking vacation with my daughter. She's been promised a vacation for several years now and it hasn't worked out. So I'm really looking forward to  taking her to the beach to see the ocean.  Or somewhere else very fine. I'm also looking forward to graduating and earning my master's degree. 
bn9jfGALn5PMVVQIiJVrlpm0X8j2	Movies books composition I have a bachelor's degree in English rhetoric and composition. 
bn9jfGALn5PMVVQIiJVrlpm0X8j2	Yes.  I  feel like I tend to shy away from the spotlight in from congratulations. I downplay my successes out of modesty and I feel like anytime I want to talk about myself.  I worried that I'm being perceived as bragging and I don't like that. 
bn9jfGALn5PMVVQIiJVrlpm0X8j2	I'm a mother of two kids and that is the most important thing in my life being a good mom and being there for my children and being healthy for them. 
bn9jfGALn5PMVVQIiJVrlpm0X8j2	and it was easy to answer I  Know Myself pretty well, and I know  What bothers me and what I am proud of? 
bn9jfGALn5PMVVQIiJVrlpm0X8j2	I definitely think it's possible. I'm being hard on myself that people don't see me that way. I know.  People respect the work that I do.  People do think that I'm very good at what I do.  And I know my kids look up to me.  I know people see me as a very good mom.  and I think when I do take  Batman and I express myself and I put myself out there. I tend to surprise people and they tend to respect and agree with.  Like the things that I put out there. 
bn9jfGALn5PMVVQIiJVrlpm0X8j2	Oh, I think they would do a complete 180. I think if there was less uncertainty and fear.  I would interact with people a lot more. I would kiss my opinions a lot more instead of keeping them to myself. I would speak up in groups instead of going to the one person. I'm confident with and telling them individually after group discussion is ended.  I would  Wright Mower and put my stories out there and actually actively try to get published.  I would speak up more and participate in community events School events.  I would feel more like an adult and not like everyone looks at me.  has just  a kid with kids 
bn9jfGALn5PMVVQIiJVrlpm0X8j2	I am proud of  participating in this program  I'm proud.  That I did put myself out there today at the meeting. Even if it didn't go as planned.  I still interacted with many members of our leadership team.  and  I'm proud of taking that.  feedback from the meeting and  I'm working on turning it around rather than giving up. 
bn9jfGALn5PMVVQIiJVrlpm0X8j2	I see myself as  an amazing mother  I see myself as an aspiring writer who has an incredible imagination.  I see myself as a hard worker.  and someone who  isn't afraid to dream. 
bn9jfGALn5PMVVQIiJVrlpm0X8j2	Earning. My master degree is exciting because I will be done with the work and then it'll give me a little bit more job security.  taking a vacation with my daughter is exciting because  Mount traveling's always fun and exciting but especially going with my daughter. It'll be a lot of fun to see how excited and happy it makes her.

bzrHUQKN8eVHrsnaLF0xC0YzfhG2	It's not and I know it's not but I just can't talk to them with all the feelings that I'm having right now. 
bzrHUQKN8eVHrsnaLF0xC0YzfhG2	Well one of them use me, but the other one is okay because I love her and she's like one of my best friend. She never did anything wrong, but my neighbor which is also her sister just used me and lied to me fake to my face without me even knowing for it like weeks. 
bzrHUQKN8eVHrsnaLF0xC0YzfhG2	No, because I'm scared of the dark will not really but I'm just scared of being alone. 
bzrHUQKN8eVHrsnaLF0xC0YzfhG2	Because I wouldn't tell anybody what I was feeling thinking and I wouldn't have the stress of not knowing if that person is going to snitch on me or betray me. 
bzrHUQKN8eVHrsnaLF0xC0YzfhG2	Because I helped him with everything. 
bzrHUQKN8eVHrsnaLF0xC0YzfhG2	When we were at lunch and data, my neighbor kept staring at me because the boy was sitting one person away from me, and I guess she got jealous.

bzrHUQKN8eVHrsnaLF0xC0YzfhG2	I can allow myself to acknowledge these feelings without losing control. 
bzrHUQKN8eVHrsnaLF0xC0YzfhG2	well, then we would probably last longer because we wouldn't have to worry about buying food or well, you know, it'll actually be worse because some people get their money from selling crops and like vegetables and that's basically food, so 
bzrHUQKN8eVHrsnaLF0xC0YzfhG2	Then everybody would have a great life and everybody would be treated equally. 
bzrHUQKN8eVHrsnaLF0xC0YzfhG2	I became friends again with this person and  that person I was talking about last time.  Keep staring at me and it's very awkward cuz now my neighbor hates me. So even more than I thought he did and I don't even think she knows that I know I think she just adding a acting like that on purpose. 
bzrHUQKN8eVHrsnaLF0xC0YzfhG2	I have this person that I really liked it. I really trusted and I told everything and I will talk to every single day for every single minute not leaving my text message Buck open, but one day I found out that my neighbor knew all of this, of course because I told her everything and she was really happy for me. She help me she supported me but then she used be lied to me and said that she was going to start dating him and doesn't even have the guts to tell me and I don't even think she knows that I know.

bzrHUQKN8eVHrsnaLF0xC0YzfhG2	Take a longer bath. Maybe go on a run maybe talk to you one of my friends that I feel like I can trust but I'm not sure. 
bzrHUQKN8eVHrsnaLF0xC0YzfhG2	I don't know what to do. Either to come from my neighbor, which is my best friend or just ignore it and  go to school knowing that everything is alright.

d3VrMVwGdbWq1IEqnzuoHx68iEB3	Too little. Most of my time is spent in my house. I live with 7 girls so it’s not like I have no social interaction but I never leave the house or hang out with anyone but my roommates. 
d3VrMVwGdbWq1IEqnzuoHx68iEB3	No. I think I have a hard time letting the people I love know that I love them. It’s hard for me to express my love to people.
d3VrMVwGdbWq1IEqnzuoHx68iEB3	I want to be more confident and extroverted. I want to make more connections with people. 
d3VrMVwGdbWq1IEqnzuoHx68iEB3	I look up to my brother a lot. He has so little and so many hardships come his way and he still takes time to see how I feel and how my life is going and asks questions about my life and cares about me. I look up to him a lot because I would love to be as selfless and caring. 
d3VrMVwGdbWq1IEqnzuoHx68iEB3	I don’t think I have more. It felt very real and it felt really good. I think secretly my brain is dying for her to talk to me again and so it’s coming out in dream form 
d3VrMVwGdbWq1IEqnzuoHx68iEB3	My best friend came and sat on my bed and gave me a hug
d3VrMVwGdbWq1IEqnzuoHx68iEB3	I was with Lauren and we were fighting and then I started showing them around Boston and some Salem witch stuff and Lauren started holding my hand and leaning into me and I was really happy. Then Markie Newhook said look it’s a rhinoceros and I pet the rhinoceros it was dressed up and on a leash like an elephant that you ride. Then Kyle my neighbor wanted to go to the muesem of bad art so we did that and we were the group behind Joe Sullivan and Anthony Barreria and a bunch of high school boys and I was with my parents but I didn’t care. And then I was at the movie theaters with my mom and Christina and they left but I wouldn’t leave and it was perfect timing bc the movie got kinda sexual and I was glad they weren’t there because it would have been awkward. Then there was a huge party going on at my house and eventually everyone left but Liz Weiss needed to sleep over at my house and she started crying on the couch right next to my mom and my mom said you need to stop hanging with weird people and I was just trying to hang this hanging plant thing and then it stopped and she fell asleep and my mom was like should we just drive through the night back to your school I’m not even tired I have so many thoughts in my mind and I was like no. 
d3VrMVwGdbWq1IEqnzuoHx68iEB3	I think I would have a less fulfilling life if I’m selfish. I want to be a good friend and daughter and one day wife and mother. Those things require caring for another person.
d3VrMVwGdbWq1IEqnzuoHx68iEB3	I think we could get a lot closer and have a better relationship 
d3VrMVwGdbWq1IEqnzuoHx68iEB3	Getting to meet new people and have new experiences. Getting to see a different culture than my own and having a better understanding of the world and putting myself out there more. 
d4QguAzY3FXwsBclR9vWbJordVL2	Can I not be at the dentist
d4QguAzY3FXwsBclR9vWbJordVL2	Walking from the nail salon to the dentist 
d4QguAzY3FXwsBclR9vWbJordVL2	I appreciate some one to talk to
d7DCmIukP0doj5pPi9EGKUJ1twC2	Sometimes I feel alone like nobody understands how I feel
d7DCmIukP0doj5pPi9EGKUJ1twC2	Well, my dad kicked me out like 3 weeks ago and for no reason because my school was telling him like I wasn't going to school everyday all that and he take me on the street for no reason. 
d7DCmIukP0doj5pPi9EGKUJ1twC2	To ignore all the negative energy that’s around me
d7DCmIukP0doj5pPi9EGKUJ1twC2	A lot I try to hold it in but sometimes I feel like crying
d7cG9QJ18wVOboYK9J5ok93DoTi1	If I don't take my medicine as prescribed, I will have a hard time focusing but I am I get fatigued very easily. 
d7cG9QJ18wVOboYK9J5ok93DoTi1	I've been having a difficult time but by focusing so I can't really read and write because I can't focus. Thanks to you or thanks straight. 
d7cG9QJ18wVOboYK9J5ok93DoTi1	Well, I really like to read and write when I feel up to it. I love Minecraft and Sims 4 household love Netflix and Disney plus as well as Hulu.  I also  love anime  and  turn off jacksepticeye on YouTube and fill your body on YouTube. There's quite a lot actually but yeah. 
d7cG9QJ18wVOboYK9J5ok93DoTi1	Yes. It can be. Sometimes it feels the same and that I’m stuck in the same position but can’t get out. 
d7cG9QJ18wVOboYK9J5ok93DoTi1	I would have to say bettering myself. 
d7cG9QJ18wVOboYK9J5ok93DoTi1	I was able to train my service dog more and she’s doing great!
d7cG9QJ18wVOboYK9J5ok93DoTi1	I have seizures and chronic illnesses
d7cG9QJ18wVOboYK9J5ok93DoTi1	It excites me because I want to be the best version of myself. 
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	The kind of people that might not want to hang out with me. 
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	I don’t think it’s what others would expect
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	I like them I’m just not proud of my accomplishments in them 
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	It’s easier and feels safer
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	I don’t think so, but I am always concerned that it’s the case. 
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	I could check in with myself more and if I am self-criticizing then I can shift to another activity to reset things. 
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	I thought I deserved better than my current living situation. 
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	I got to listen to a very cool podcast and text Karen. I always feel so special when I get the opportunity to chat with her. 
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	I’ve had trouble keeping and maintaining a social circle. I think I tend to push people away. 
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	To keep reading my book. That reading makes me feel emotionally better.
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	A little too much just to distract myself
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	That it would be okay if I found a new job or went to school for awhile 
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	Being liked and being respected are two different things 
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	That I don’t like being misunderstood
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	I spent extra time with my friend Marc so he wasn’t lonely. 
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	That actions I don’t like by another person that don’t involve me could merely be a difference in opinion
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	Taking a risk isn’t a dumb decision. It could be a good thing. 
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	That I appreciate a sense of belonging 
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	Maybe it’s going to be okay. Maybe things aren’t as dark as I thought they were last week. 
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	I am really motivated by my own growth but am scared of it. I’m a lesbian, I love things but am not passionate about the things I do at work. I have a lot of regrets. I’m very athletic but don’t feel like I’ve achieved very much 
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	No one is in control of my life except for me
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	Depression swings, adjustment, comfort with intimacy 
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	If I had been a little more intentional with my downtime, and been less frozen in my own thoughts and feelings. 
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	Focus on me, and just do the best I can. 
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	I need to apologize to Tami. To wrap up the convo from our fight so we can have a good trip
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	Finishing work and getting a few hrs to myself
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	Running, dinner at Mexican restaurant, and TV watching with Christina
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	I got to ride the bus and train which means I can read more
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	My sweet partner Tami made me feel good today by buying me dinner and having a lovely Indian meal.
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	Getting the house relatively clean and cooking 
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	LAughing with Tami. And going to therapy
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	Sitting in a coffee shop and texting all the people I have been avoiding. 
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	The taste of dinner and my list of things that are occupying my headspace 
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	Smart, but emotional and obsessive 
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	I'm going to say it again.  My mind is truly brilliant. 
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	It started off really rough and actually got better. I’ve been in such a dark space....numb and it was nice to feel things and then connect with people. 
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	It started very numb feeling, got better and then I had a loud argument with my girlfriend 
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	"At some points during the day I lost motivation because I felt like I couldn’t get ahead, and I had no interest in focusing on my job. 

"
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	I don’t know if I’m feeling very committed to anything other than my happiness. It’s just so miserable not to be happy. 
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	I did not accomplish many goals or tasks, but I did a few 
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	Yes, I did not manage it well
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	I didn’t make any goals today. So I guess I don’t know. 
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	No, but I did some things 
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	I don’t know if I completed many tasks but I did get a few things done. 
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	I talked to a lot of people and felt like I did accomplish a few administrative tasks. 
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	Destination. Today was a day full of travel so it was all about getting to where I needed to go. 
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	I don’t know if I was very successful in accomplishing my goals, but it didn’t seem to matter
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	I’ve been a good friend to some of my friends. I think I’ve been a good “big sister” to my friend Kelsey as she has navigated some tough spots in life. I think I’m spite of our troubles that am am a positive presence in my girlfriend Tami’s life 
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	I don’t know if I’m thankful for a personal trait or skill
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	I did sleep better than the night before
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	My sleep. I used to live in a loud building and could never sleep through the night. Ever since I moved to my new home I am able to sleep through the night.
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	I’m actually happy about the dreary weather. 
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	I want to progress as an individual and that progress is missing right now. 
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	I had the chance to slowly wake up and enjoy coffee, working out and reading. Had a productive work day and a good dinner at the end of the day. Also happy I get to go to bed early.
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	I had a long work day. Woke up early, felt productive and had good conversations. Finished the day with a yummy dinner, a beer and some alone time. 
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	Work and spend time with Tamara 
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	It was stressful at first as there was a giant snowstorm. But I worked, went to a work lunch, did some work from a hotel, had a nice dinner and am hopefully going to rest and recover from a long day previously. I also ran and listened to a podcast 
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	Read my book, travelled to work, left work early, cooked dinner, and watched tv with my partner 
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	I was productive and am looking forward to having tomorrow off 
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	"

"
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	Continue to clean the house, look at tamis house, cook and run. 
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	When I am with others I want to check in to see if what I’m doing is what I want to be doing. If it’s not it’s my life and I can give myself permission to change it 
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	I was thrifty and creative with lunch and dinner 
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	Time this evening with my girlfriend Tamara, and quality time with her
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	Reading a few pages of my book 
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	Another opportunity to try to be me around others 
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	Tomorrow, sleeping in on a day I didn’t think I’d be able to
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	I have the skills I learned from human element
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	It was easy, but just sad that I can’t seem to progress much. 
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	I don’t think I’m good at the new job I’ve been in. I don’t feel confident that it will result in the happiness I’m looking for long term
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	It’s probably not completely accurate 
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	I think my emotions wouldn’t take me to dark spots like they do now. I think I would have more energy and be more successful at work. I feel like I’m perceived as messy and that makes me feel like a loser.
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	I am going on vacation today with my girlfriend and three of our friends. We are going on a ski trip. I have a lot of books and articles to catch up on so I’m excited about that!
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	I have to go to work, and talk to people. I have to workout and eat too
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	Try to focus on if I’m doing something for me or for others. Sit with myself. Read some of my book. Do my own routine regardless of what tam is doing. 
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	"Making food for today
Cleaning out car
Getting ready for the day
Attending meetings
Finishing and catching up on work
Picking up mail and packages 
Making doctors appointments "
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	I will make healthy decisions for my body day, because I’m worth it
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	Try body do some pretty incredible things. 
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	You deserve to feel comfortable in my own skin. 
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	Not an object, my body always deserves to be respect. 
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	When it needs it, my body deserves some rest and relaxation
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	I think more than most people...ask questions and am curious. I believe in acceptance. I am resilient and that has driven professional success. I am active. I think I’m interesting. 
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	I’m trying to make decisions that are best reflective of who I am, and instead I behave to mold to the situation around me. 
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	No I don’t think so. I think I could bring my own mold and if it doesn’t fit that would tell me the situation isn’t for me. 
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	On our romantic relationship 
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	 Not a whole lot, I feel out of shape
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	Getting on the bus early this morning and completing this exercise
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	Reading, being on the bus, and making dinner 
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	I got rejected to work on projects at work. I sent texts that were never returned. I’m a loser at my job and people I thought were my friends are not
d87yPTmmJvVShUqS7XfsdyD6JcP2	I got to travel for both business and pleasure. Felt like something I enjoy doing and makes me wonder if I liked a job that involved more traveling.
dBDm0x3LmUcARMoG3NQXcmGDT493	He's leaving for his grandma's on tomorrow.  And spending the night at his grandma's as his grandma's going to be taking him to his job that he's leaving out for a month and I asked him if he could stay a little bit longer Friday and said to be at work at 3 and he flat out told me that that was a no. 
dBDm0x3LmUcARMoG3NQXcmGDT493	Have neither one of them are fun to have.  I don't want to be depressed all the time. I don't want to have anxiety all the time.  If I could live a happy life and I'll have to worry about all that.  Be great. 
dBDm0x3LmUcARMoG3NQXcmGDT493	Maybe not being afraid of saying certain things and actually been able to talk to him about anything without being afraid that he's gone to get mad at me. 
dBDm0x3LmUcARMoG3NQXcmGDT493	Yes, I always understand where he's coming from and I respect his opinion and try to understand everything but I want him to understand where I come from Two and it's like what I think I'll ask Phil doesn't matter. 
dBDm0x3LmUcARMoG3NQXcmGDT493	At this point, I don't even know how to make new friends. I'm a step. Mom of two kids at 5 and 3 year old 5 year olds a boy three year olds girl, so don't really get to get out much because they got the kids now and everything and taking care of the house was trying to work a full-time job.  So honestly, I have no idea how to make friends anymore. 
dBDm0x3LmUcARMoG3NQXcmGDT493	Brushes at all. He doesn't really mean.  why conflict he ignores it and just  doesn't do anything about it. Just want to communicate about it and I am maybe open up more.  for him to  make improvements. I don't know. 
dBDm0x3LmUcARMoG3NQXcmGDT493	I think my boyfriend is cheating on me with his baby mama. 
dBDm0x3LmUcARMoG3NQXcmGDT493	We try talking about it the other day and he is told me that and I can believe what I want and that's my choice for believing that but it's not happening.  He doesn't want to talk about it and he just wants to ignore it even though I want to talk about it. 
dBDm0x3LmUcARMoG3NQXcmGDT493	I'm not sure honestly.  It's been an emotional day. My boyfriend is leaving out for work Saturday and he wanted me home tomorrow. I just I don't know felt more like he doesn't want to be here but it's at the same time. He does. I don't know. I just feel alone today. It's been a rough day. 
dBDm0x3LmUcARMoG3NQXcmGDT493	I'm determined to not let  my depression and anxiety  Roaming, even though it's hard some days.  Determined to overpower in to beat a doll. 
dBDm0x3LmUcARMoG3NQXcmGDT493	Because he feels like I'm overreacting. Anything that I feel is just me overreacting and taking in something.  too serious 
dBDm0x3LmUcARMoG3NQXcmGDT493	I don't know honestly.  I've tried talking to him, but he just tells me that's my choice or feeling that way and if I want to feel that way that's my choice.  He doesn't feel that way that I just I'm overreacting. 
dG83J9jjmxYxzpedG9vWEkcJhjF2	On a soccer field, maybe I like a school. 
dG83J9jjmxYxzpedG9vWEkcJhjF2	Hanging out with my boyfriend.  I'm going to a Christmas party. 
dG83J9jjmxYxzpedG9vWEkcJhjF2	Then we wouldn't have to deal with addicts that like needs drugs and stuff and that ruin families because they would rather have their mess and go to their children soccer game. 
dG83J9jjmxYxzpedG9vWEkcJhjF2	I would be nicer to people because the Maggie nicer to me. 
dG83J9jjmxYxzpedG9vWEkcJhjF2	Instead of mess. I meant to say mess like the drug.  And I'm not sure if they actually go to soccer games.  They're probably too busy doing the math.

dOjEAeVkuCTkbD9SmTfIiw6AwPq1	I feel like I still love him and he's deployed in Norway right now and  I feel like  we could get back together again.  Maybe 
dOjEAeVkuCTkbD9SmTfIiw6AwPq1	Do you have to I'm in the way that I do it is?  Breaking down a little bit, but then build them back up or you can do like a Hands-On training and show them what they need to do talk to them like brother and sister.  expensive home pork and it is for them to  do what you have to do. 
dOjEAeVkuCTkbD9SmTfIiw6AwPq1	My shoulder is in healed yet. I'm actually getting surgery on it in 2 weeks. 
dOjEAeVkuCTkbD9SmTfIiw6AwPq1	I feel like I'll be okay live in California, but regarding Andrew, I feel like I honestly do think we would have another chance again just because I know the weight for he is and I know that he still loves me and  I feel like  if he's not willing to date then he would at least be okay with staying friends. 
dOjEAeVkuCTkbD9SmTfIiw6AwPq1	Minnesota has always been my home, but  I really want to live in California and I would really want to move to California. And so I think that's my gut instinct is to go to California or I've always wanted to be 
dOjEAeVkuCTkbD9SmTfIiw6AwPq1	I can paint and I can go swimming. 
dOjEAeVkuCTkbD9SmTfIiw6AwPq1	more stressed but anxious and excited also because I know that the time is up and that my decision will be made and I'll have to be getting ready to move to California and  you know start working. 
dOjEAeVkuCTkbD9SmTfIiw6AwPq1	The same I know I'll feel the same about it. 
dOjEAeVkuCTkbD9SmTfIiw6AwPq1	I just found out today that I have a stress fracture in my hip. 
dOjEAeVkuCTkbD9SmTfIiw6AwPq1	My name is Jessica. I'm 21 years old. I'm in the United States Marine Corps.  I was raised in Minnesota, but I am stationed in, North Carolina. 
dOjEAeVkuCTkbD9SmTfIiw6AwPq1	I want to feel more motivated about.  my mental health and being happier and  not being stressed about work and not being scared for my surgery. 
dOjEAeVkuCTkbD9SmTfIiw6AwPq1	well, they would be different if my parents supported me and  it would be different this.  I didn't get in trouble with my DWI and they would be different if I had money.  and I was able to afford my car payment in my car and  expensive lifestyle in California 
dOjEAeVkuCTkbD9SmTfIiw6AwPq1	Yes, my aunt my mom sister.  Because she lives in California and I want to work where she's working.  Finally she could help me a lot but  She's also not that table so I don't want to rely on her.  And put all my trust into her.  Because if things go wrong, she won't be able to help me and I'll be stuck with myself. 
dOjEAeVkuCTkbD9SmTfIiw6AwPq1	honestly  my future husband or future boyfriend. I don't see myself.  Dating anyone in Minnesota, and I definitely see myself living in Minnesota and getting married to some.  Mexican in California, and so I think those are the big variables and I know then California, I'm going to have more family over there. I don't want to fit in more might have more fun would be happier. I might be less stressful. I already know. 
dOjEAeVkuCTkbD9SmTfIiw6AwPq1	I'm going to move to California. That's my final decision. I'm going to be away from my family and I'm going to get closer to my aunt and I'm going to try to reach out to Andrew and  like a dozen workout Andrew then  it's okay. I know that I will find someone else. 
dOjEAeVkuCTkbD9SmTfIiw6AwPq1	well, I don't want to go to Minnesota because  my family is there and they don't support me and all we do is argue and I don't want to live in that environment anymore, California is just so much more fun. And there's more Mexicans and I can definitely see my future there and I can't see my future Minnesota. I just seem so Bland and boring to me. 
dOjEAeVkuCTkbD9SmTfIiw6AwPq1	well this month I want to get a rhinoplasty and I'm also getting my shoulder surgery this month and  In one year, I finished my 4 year contract with the Marine Corps.  And I'll be entering the civilian life again. 
dOjEAeVkuCTkbD9SmTfIiw6AwPq1	I was just kidding sad because I was thinking about my ex Andrew and I had a long day at work. 
dOjEAeVkuCTkbD9SmTfIiw6AwPq1	partying going out drinking 
dOjEAeVkuCTkbD9SmTfIiw6AwPq1	yes, my  DWI  and  my parents because  my parents give me stress. 
dOjEAeVkuCTkbD9SmTfIiw6AwPq1	I have about a year, but I want to make my decision.  As soon as possible. 
dOjEAeVkuCTkbD9SmTfIiw6AwPq1	Honestly, I think that I can do anything. I put my mind to I just want  support because if I have support then I know that I will have people who are depending on me and I will feel more comfortable about my decisions. 
dOjEAeVkuCTkbD9SmTfIiw6AwPq1	My anxiety isn't comfortable but I am in charge and know how to handle it. My anxiety isn't comfortable.  But I'm in charge and I know how to handle it. 
dOjEAeVkuCTkbD9SmTfIiw6AwPq1	positive energy is slowly being absorbed into my body and it's feeling better  positive energy is slowly being absorbed into my body and it's feeling better 
dOjEAeVkuCTkbD9SmTfIiw6AwPq1	I know that if I go to, California.  I'm going to want to get in contact with my ex boyfriend again.  And I know that I'm going to want to try.  To get into a relationship with him again.  And I'm going to look for him. I know I am. I know I'm going to try to contact him. 
dOjEAeVkuCTkbD9SmTfIiw6AwPq1	I want to change people's lives. I love working with children. I love working with  young adults  I like helping anyone in need.  And I like making others happy. 
dOjEAeVkuCTkbD9SmTfIiw6AwPq1	My primary goal for this year is figuring out what I am going to do after I finish.  my time in the United States Marine Corps  I need to figure out what career.  path, I'm going to take  and  that's going to be tough for me. 
dOjEAeVkuCTkbD9SmTfIiw6AwPq1	I think  learning how to paint  could be fun.  or maybe how to do makeup 
dOjEAeVkuCTkbD9SmTfIiw6AwPq1	just save as much money as I can and start planning what I'm going to do when I get out so that I'll be able to  Have I still figured out before I get to California? 
dOjEAeVkuCTkbD9SmTfIiw6AwPq1	I think in 10 years than absolutely I'll be happy that I moved to California and I'll be happy that I made a decision and I know that it's going to be worth it. 
dOjEAeVkuCTkbD9SmTfIiw6AwPq1	I am coming to an end of my military contract and the United States Marine Corps, and I have a year left and service and I need to decide before that your is done what I plan on doing.  in the civilian sector  and I need to decide.  quit my job is going to be  where I'm going to live.  how I am going to  afford  my car and car insurance  Who I'm going to live with?  And what the plan B is in case that doesn't work? 
dOjEAeVkuCTkbD9SmTfIiw6AwPq1	well, I know that he's going to be busy in the police academy studying and he told me going to be stressed and tired all the time and  he's probably not going to want distractions and I'm going to want attention and I'm going to want to be talking to him and texting him and I feel like the same things going to happen. Like she's not going to have time for me and he's going to see that it's not going to work out some but I'm going to keep trying because  I'm going to be in the same state as him and hopefully nearby. 
dOjEAeVkuCTkbD9SmTfIiw6AwPq1	To just be happy and not stress.  and to not cry everyday 
dOjEAeVkuCTkbD9SmTfIiw6AwPq1	because I have a stress fracture to my hip and I have a  separated AC joint 
dOjEAeVkuCTkbD9SmTfIiw6AwPq1	That I don't have enough money that it's hard.  getting one or two jobs  are working multiple jobs and that my aunt gets too busy for me and she can help me out tour.  something happens to my grandparents and you know  I don't get really sad.  That I tried talking to Andrew again my ex and it doesn't work out between us and I end up getting my heart broken again and just being sad and stressed again. 
dOjEAeVkuCTkbD9SmTfIiw6AwPq1	I would tell them to follow their heart but to think it through late because California is very expensive versus, Minnesota.  That is not that expensive.  so  I would say to save a lot of money and already have a plan before moving over there because  once you're over there, are you going to need a car and you don't have to pay car insurance and car payments and the payments are going to be high because of my DWI. 
dOjEAeVkuCTkbD9SmTfIiw6AwPq1	because I got a DWI a few months back and that affects my  career that I wanted to have which was a police officer. And so now I won't be able to be a police officer. So I need to find something else that I want to do. 
dOjEAeVkuCTkbD9SmTfIiw6AwPq1	Yes work.  my X  and my injuries 
dOjEAeVkuCTkbD9SmTfIiw6AwPq1	will my hips have been hurting for like 3 years now and  my shoulder has been hurting since October 2018. 
dOjEAeVkuCTkbD9SmTfIiw6AwPq1	That I won't be in the military anymore and I'll be able to live where I've always wanted to live. Which is, California. 
dOjEAeVkuCTkbD9SmTfIiw6AwPq1	definitely  I'm going to be.  Giving up a lot of money because the cost of living in California is so much higher than Minnesota.  And with all the traffic, I know it's going to be so much gas money, and I don't know yet if I'm going to buy a car over there or if I'm going to drive my car for, Minnesota always, California. 
dOjEAeVkuCTkbD9SmTfIiw6AwPq1	I can try doing things that relax me. 
dOjEAeVkuCTkbD9SmTfIiw6AwPq1	I think they would say that.  It's a good choice just to be smart with my money and that maybe I'll need one or two jobs.  Or at least a good paying job. 
dOjEAeVkuCTkbD9SmTfIiw6AwPq1	well  I know there's good and bad things about going to California and I know  My family is going to think that I'm going over there just so I can party and get crazy and they're going to think that I'm going to be just like my aunt.  unsuccessful and  Not get far in life, but I'm still going to do it because she's the most supportive person. I have my life right now. 
dOjEAeVkuCTkbD9SmTfIiw6AwPq1	I could but  it's going to be hard because if I don't move to California and try and getting a job there then I will never  I've never really going to know if I am able to do it or not. 
dOjEAeVkuCTkbD9SmTfIiw6AwPq1	They won't if anything go help.  I mean, I know that I'm going to have to work hard.  To be able to afford living over there. But as soon as the day is going to be worth it. 
dOjEAeVkuCTkbD9SmTfIiw6AwPq1	I'm feeling anxious about my shoulder surgery in 2 weeks and I just found out today that I have a stress.  fracture in my hip  and they are going to give me  either a scooter or crutches to walk in.

dqeRQ4TDgNcHJfng6e1TQGCrPXv1	Rabbiting wrapping my children's gifts. My kids gives Marquis Anita my grandbaby. That made me smile.  I'm able to give him a gift this year for Christmas.  the blessing 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	I know but it doesn't seem to matter does it?  I feel like I'm treated. Well. Anyways, I guess I could all be in my head but  It wouldn't treat me well.  Maybe I am a bad person and is deserve all this awful treatment. 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	No.  I mean you could force it on them. But even then that just causes resentment and it's hard to tell when people actually want help and when they're pretending like they don't want to help you know, where they just be bashful and say oh no. No, I got it. I'm fine. Thanks, but really are saying yeah, I really could use some help but I'm just too embarrassed to ask for it and I want you to want to help me.  But it's hard to tell the difference between that and somebody who actually doesn't want help but just wants to play Lately till you know, they don't need your help. 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	There's no reason not to it's just it's hard. It's hard to make a change to your life because I wonder if I'm just being a rationals. I need to stick it out if things maybe we'll just calm down here and it maybe I'm being emotional hell, maybe I'm going to be on my. Like I don't.  I don't know.  I want to change it's just hard to make it into the stick to it and can it do it, especially since I talked myself out of it so quickly. It would be nice to just do it. You know, just think lesson do you think too much? 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	No, I mean I know I'm not happy with where my life is and I just want it to get better. So I know that I'm making the right steps. It's just it takes time. I don't want to settle for the bare minimum. I don't want to live in an apartment and have a minimum wage job my whole life, you know, I want to do more and do better and take risks healthy wrists and  prioritize myself and get what I want out of life. 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	Not paying any money man. I don't know I hated living with my parents. We never got along.  We're not even close to this day. Just not paying for anything. I guess not really having the worry having the freedom to wonder how much in electric bill or water bill would cause her Trasher.  Any of its how much food really cost how to make food? Like I would just come home and my mom already had dinner plans. I never had to worry about what I was going to do for dinner when I know I  I miss that I miss that a lot and it's not having to worry about things so much having it be my parents problem. Now. Everything's my problem. I have to worry and think about everything. 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	I think that life's really hard to go through on your own.  Things very few people in this world can make it without any help or very little help.  We all give in little ways and I think that it's really hard to make it through life by yourself.  Even Hermits in the woods need some help. 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	What is normal anymore?  I don't know.  just being able to  be fake and I'll pretend like you're happy all the time pretend like you're kind all the time pretend like there's no issues in the world. Everything's just pretty little butterflies. That's pretty much what it boiled down to these days. You know, you just have to fake it till you make it and nobody questions you  So that's the only way I can see people as being normal is I'm not very good at being normal because I'm not good at hiding my emotions. I always either look angry or upset or tired or sad or who knows why I'm not very good at hiding what I'm really feeling people can tell when I'm mad or angry or upset or sad or happy.  I sure will all on my face. 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	I mean I guess.  Well done bad things, right?  I've never been a good person.  I have wide I've stolen.  miserable  feel like I'd given a given a gift but it doesn't really matter because maybe Mike or an awful person. 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	a house  I've always wanted to own my own house since I was little I said design them myself and my mom's a realtor so she sold them, So I was always around that concept to my dad's a builder so he builds houses and I've always wanted to build my own dream house.  nothing crazy nothing big just something that fits me and  I don't know my lifestyle I guess.  I think that's going to be a couple years away, but that's what I'm working towards now. 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	I think it just comes off fake. Like I don't even think I can fool myself. I'm not a very good liar. I have a really hard time pretending to be happy. You know, I can forget about my problems for a minute. That's probably the closest I can get to pretending to be really happy, but I just forgetting everything going on, but  the people who really know me can tell the difference between my real happiness and my fake happiness, and I don't  I don't even know if those people really know me anymore either. 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	I don't even remember anymore so long ago.  Free I guess I had so many limits.  Living with my parents and being underage. You don't get to do anything you want so you don't feel like your life is your own you feel like you're just living for somebody else. So being 18 is  Is freedom it's doing what you want and not worrying about what your family thinks are in truly doing. What's best for you. You start making all your own decisions. Nobody else makes any decisions for you. Not even the littlest things you decide if you want to go College you decide if you want to finish school you decide if you want to live in an apartment you decide if you want to buy a house if you want to have a boyfriend if you want to sleep in all day, if you want to eat junk food for the next week, you get to decide everything and that was the most exciting part for me is that I got to make all my own decisions. Nobody else got to tell me what to do or you know what they thought. 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	maintaining some positivity and kindness 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	I am going to work on stuttering less like actually thinking about what I'm saying for slowing down in life.  Won't work on my anxiety just relaxing a little bits not stressing so much maybe considering what's really important and stop putting so much emphasis on the things that don't matter.  Not caring as much about people. I know it sounds bad, but  worrying about myself first putting making myself a priority and making other people seconds and  focusing on my hobbies and spending time by myself and enjoying it instead of feeling bad about it. And if I can work on my health and my eating habits and great really focusing on school. Just wanting to graduate and get done and get out in the real world and start practicing and just  I don't know for this year. It would be nice if I could move into a cheaper place maybe with some friends or people who were friendly. I guess you could say.  And focusing on my dog making him happy. 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	Maybe life isn't going to be so bad that maybe Culver's wasn't going to be so bad, but it's not.  Great.  I would leave right now if I thought that Kaylee and Isaac would still talk to me if I didn't work there. 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	I was thinking that maybe my job isn't it worse place after all and that people are generally on my side and that they care and I just am running a lot about boundaries and what I can do and what I can't do and it's so hard finding a balance between the two but he's going to be okay. 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	I always just a jolt awake and I don't know if I say anything or scream or cry or whatever, but I just jolts awake and then it takes a moment for me to calm down and then I can go back to sleep. But sometimes I pick up right where I left off or replays. 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	Not very good at all. This whole year has been awful and here I am on another holiday just  saying by myself  Do I have any close friends or family to rely on? It's all me all the time.  And playing down pretty hard.  barri loans 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	I've been sleeping too much and that's just how I know. I'm depressed as I just want to sleep all the time. I'm always tired. I'm always not in the mood to deal with anything. I'm just always over.  Sleeping the only thing that brings me Comfort and it's just like not existing for a couple hours. 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	I have a reoccurring nightmare that I'm walking down this street and it's a street. I don't recognize and for some reason I know I'm in college and people running around and they just start screaming and they're like saying it's after them is after them and I just know that I have to run and so I start running all the way to my dorm and I busting through the door and my roommate who I don't recognize as she's like, what are you doing? I said killing people and so we turn off the lights and hunker down and we see this monster right outside our window and it's just growls and walks by and then we hear people screaming in the dorm and the monster bus in through the door and my roommate freaks out and she's just screaming and shuffling around and Just get sick of it and I push her out of the way so I can go to safety. And so I wait until the monsters done eating her and he forgets about me and he runs out and then I just start running out and I just start running down the street and all of a sudden gets really quiet and I stopped and I turn around behind me and this monsters there and I wake up every time. 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	I never see the correlation like whatever I have nightmares about isn't about something that's happening right now. It's something in the past or something. I think might happen in the future, but I don't have nightmares about what I'm going through currently. 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	Normally, I just have to walk around a lot at work or if I'm at school. I'm on my feet a lot. But  Hiking I just never get the chance to do it. I love swimming I love  I like running actually, but I just don't my body can't handle it anymore. I like kayaking.  I'm just walking doesn't have to be anything crazy. Just going for a stroll. 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	My jigsaw puzzles are pretty much the biggest thing. 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	No, nothing's new.  Am I fix the same boring cycle?  Constant failures and sadness with just pre glimpses of happiness.  I haven't done anything lately. I've  been working on a puzzle 4 days that I can so I can finish I'm working on the TV show that I'm not even fully invested in. I have barely spent any time by myself with my dog or my cat or just relaxing. I've been working so much and then I have to go back to school soon too. And so they're going to take more energy out of me and I don't know if I don't know if I have that energy. 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	I got in a fight with my best friend and it looks like we're not going to be friends anymore. And so I had to spend the day part of the day and just like an awkward silence with her.  But she it's your last day of work here and then she goes back to her college. So I really don't have to worry about seeing her again for a long time, but I started talking to my ex and it looks like we're going to be good friends. And yeah, so I guess it was kind of a day. 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	I took Kota for a walk and we played Fetch and I worked all day and I got everything done I needed to.  and I'm going to think I need to do leftists setup for my client tomorrow, but  I guess I'm fine. I think I did everything I needed to. 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	I think for this month, I need to try waking up earlier. I feel like that's a good start because if I wake up earlier and I start feeling good about waking up earlier. I'm going to have the energy to do things in the morning, which is when things get done.  And so if I can get myself and I can focus on it this month by waking up early and being energetic or motivated by it and that would be really good.  If not, now let's say I do that. Okay, let's say that I wake up early every single day this month. I managed to get myself to get in a good routine. Then I will start going to the gym right next door. I can walk right over and that way I can start working on that and then I'll just start working on more meals at home and taking meals to work instead of just eating the food there.  and  I'll be back to school in March. So maybe every month, you know tank on a little bit more. So January wake up early February go to the gym 30 minutes a day.  March home more, you know, start transitioning over to 50% of my meals being made at home.  April be back in school. So maybe by April I can find another job or another income Source. I guess you could say.  And I don't know.  It's kind of go from there. Maybe short-term goals are better. Let's not make it whole goal for the whole year. That will be way too hard. 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	I'm in love with my best friend. 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	I got ready for a night out.  I put a dress on and he'll so I did my makeup in my hair. Actually thought I looked really nice and I thought I was going to have a good night. 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	All the time. I try not to and I feel like I've gotten better about not caring about certain things, but  think I just care less about what people think that I look like and more about who they think I am as a person.  And some people I just don't care and then I feel like the people who whose opinions really don't matter. I care about the most. 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	Yes, or no. I feel like I push myself too hard on things that don't matter and I don't push myself hard enough on the things that do, you know, like finishing schooler sticking with something. I feel like I give up too easy and I'm trying really hard to stick with it.  And I don't know then on other things. I feel like I self I push myself too hard. I make too many commitments. I try to make too many people happy. I try to work too much. I try to juggle too much. I think I am really hard on myself for a lot of things, but I think I'm not hard on myself for the things that really do matter of mice like what's going to get me through the next year. What's going to pay the bills? What's going to make me happy? 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	No, but I'm trying.  Working on my mental health has been the chore for the past. I don't even know 10 years.  physical health I never really had an issue with it up until the past couple years and  I should say I'm working on it. I recognize there's a problem which I guess is the first at then I want to work on it more. I don't think I'm necessarily in bad shape. I'm not overweight, but I'm not particularly then any more, you know.  I have a roundness to me and  I guess I can take better care of myself. Physically. I just never felt like I had the time or the motivation or the energy and now that I have a little bit of time off school. I wanted to focus on that, but I haven't really gotten around to it.  But I guess that's the point there's never really a good time to focus on your health. You just kind of have to do it or make time for it. 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	I know, but what's the point in that when people just disappointing you anyways?  You can be as nice as you want to someone.  Crying and loving and I just shitted all over it again and again and again.  Does it matter how nice you are to people people always feed themselves? 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	Finding motivation or just not having people help me or challenge me with it or not being understanding that I've always wanted to quit Culver's I hated working there. I sold you but my family would put me down for it. They'd say well it's a good job and you get paid. So why not stick with it, you know just suck it up deal with it, but they don't really know what it's like and I feel like if they were in the same position as a me, they would be wanting to quit. Nobody would judge them. It's just because I'm young. They think that I can't stick with anything and or that I'm a job Hopper. I never going to be happy you're successful and it is hard because I do make so much at Culver's that I just lose motivation with it. All right. I have a hard time justifying leaving and that's mostly been my New Year's resolutions that are losing weight, but then I get depressed and then I gain it all back every time I lose weight I end up gaining. Back and I'm in the same spot that I am and I don't look any different. I didn't change. I'm just here, you know, I'd like to have a change. I like to stick with something. I like to have motivation and  self control 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	Have excitement like something new starting and it's kind of like the butterflies in your stomach when you're starting something new and exciting. That's kind of how I felt. 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	home  Come on.  free art  Sunshine definitely sunshine  relaxation 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	I think  I just can't Inspire myself. I just know that I can do better in life. So I just keep pushing myself harder and harder and hired only have an inspiration. I just know what I want. 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	Not very much.  I think people generally can care and be giving and  want to help  just hired until like let them help you and  I don't know. I don't know what I like about people.  Thanks, just that.  They're fun, and people tend to be fun and be good company. 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	I expect them to be kind generous loving fun intelligence.  non-judgmental 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	Mostly, I just want to see a change. I just know that my life isn't it's not making me happy.  I don't know if everything is a collective is making me unhappy or if it's just one big thing like and I maybe if I got a new job that would make me feel happy or if I started working out maybe I'd feel happier. If I start focusing on school and a new class than that. I feel happier. So I don't even know I don't know if it's all of it if I need to change all of it at once or if that's too much changed or what but I think I need a change this year. I need something good something positive something healthy and I'm hoping my new class with new students will help me get out there and help me feel more comfortable with where I'm at. Help me focus on school, but I don't know. I feel like  Feel like no matter what I do. I'm still a little behind. I'm still a little stuck and  thinking maybe a new job, but it's very hard to leave a place that's had your bag for so long and a place that you're settled into and comfortable and  but a little miserable so  I think it's just my misery that makes me drive to change something. I need something positive and need something to happen something dramatic and new and instance. That would make me feel better. 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	That people don't care about me as much as I care about them. 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	snuggled with Coda minute ago  That was it. 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	Yeah, I made Isaac smile. 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	Having Isaac over here at the apartment. 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	It's been pretty shit.  Turn off all week-end today definitely wasn't any better. 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	I spent parts of my morning with my ex and my dog at a park or we talked and talked and  Venom  I went to work at a little frustrated came home and Isaac came here.  Sell my apartment gave me a treat that I forgot.  Hey left. 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	I want to share with anyone people tend to ruin good things or make me feel bad about it, you know, or what if I go back on it, then I got to  I'll be embarrassed. I just would rather not tell anyone about it. Cuz what are they going to do to help me nothing my grandmother going to help me get into shape. No.  No one's going to help me.  I have to do it all on my own. That's basically how life is you have to cope on your own. You don't have the support system people don't have support systems. It's all a lie. My family doesn't support me. They don't help me my friends. Don't help me or support me. They just judge me and then I'm supposed to be cool that I guess. 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	They freak out they get angry.  I mean if you treat people well because they treated you well, they aren't as appreciative and I think people see it as the same. You know, I could buy someone house.  But they'll never see a house. So just see what other things that could have given then, you know, if somebody treated me poorly and I treat them the same way they're going to see me as a bad guy and it received themselves as someone who was at fault. 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	I hang out with my dog or my cats might like to do jigsaw puzzles or watch TV to do craft things.  Shop and spend money I shouldn't.  sleep 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	Put up with the negative shirt and I wouldn't be able to comment on my body or how I look or the actions of taking in life. I don't really care because I can't change them, you know.  I'll try not to stress about the things that I can't change. I can't change the past. I can't change how I I look or how attractive I am to someone and I think I really care about is the things that I think I can change and if people don't like me or have issues with the things that I could change it bothers me. 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	Same thing nothing is new.  the same cycle batshit everyday 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	No, I do push myself on things that don't matter like if I'm going out enough for enjoying my life or if I'm dating or not or if it's okay to be 22 and single or you know, if I'm really enjoying my life to the fullest or if I'm just kind of hanging out hoping waiting to die and I know it.  her--no  I feel like I care too much about the little things and I really should start caring more about.  so big things  cuz at the end of the day the little things don't even add up to big things anymore. You know, it doesn't matter what clothes I wear if I have enough clothes or if I did my laundry or if I did my dishes or if I'm eating healthy or not. You know, it only matters if I can make it through this day and the next day in the night. 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	I work on it every day.  It's a  it's tough and I really struggle with it and not just in the regular depressed anxiety kind of level, but I think everybody needs to work on their mental health and improving themselves. So I do that pretty regularly.  Some days. I just have a really bad day and it's really hard for me to focus on my mental health and it's easier to just wallow in my self-pity, but I'm trying so it's a everyday I work a little better at it a little bit on my patience a little bit on my  Positivity little bit on my relaxation learning how to take time for myself and not just always focusing on others. 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	They invited me out one friend didn't invite me out tonight. New Year's Eve.  because she didn't feel like it so I guess  The other friends made plans with me, but then ditched me and never got back to me until now one friend isn't answering and the other friend says she's too tired to talk to me. So  none of them care. 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	Maybe but maybe since they're so small. We never noticed them or they don't really matter in the grand scheme of things. Why do small things for people when you could do big things? 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	Yeah, I've always wanted to be in a position to where I could help people. You know, I could donate to charity I could help out a friend. I could help someone pay off their house or retire or go on a dream vacation or have their dream wedding or dream car. I've always wanted didn't have enough money to help other people just doesn't seem that they want to help me the same way. 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	Then I can work with people that I don't like Ray don't care for that. People will see me how they want to see me, you know, if they want a picture of me is the good guy or the bad guy they will and there's nothing I can do to change that and to put up with a lot less and to treat myself with respect and to demand respect in return.  I learned that giving  Often doesn't reciprocate.  and that's Nigel and I had a good conversation kind of double a little bit, but  We communicated then there was no shoes. Guess you could say. 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	Well, I had put Cosmetology on the back burner and I'm revisiting it now, but I put journalism on the back burner to but I think I'd really like to get back into writing and work my book a lot more.  And I don't know Spanish.  I spent a great deal my life trying to learn Spanish and I got really good at it, but then I stopped and I forgot a lot and I need a major Refresher. 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	Failure feeling my family not achieving my life goals in my dreams not being able to travel around the world's not doing everything I wanted to do before I die. 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	definitely not  in people don't want me to get better.  They act like they do but nobody wants to help or put in the time. They judge my decisions and wonder if I'm doing the right thing.  And people just want me to settle with the bare minimum because it's less disappointing or they just don't want to deal with it if I fail. 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	I mean they do.  They don't think that I can achieve anything or maybe it's because I have given up on a lot of things. They don't think that I can succeed. So I think they just don't want me to try and I don't disappoint myself and I don't disappoint them and then they have to pretend like they're okay with it and I have to pretend like it didn't happen.  They just don't want me to try anymore. They just want me to settle with what I have. 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	Call the police for what? 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	Slowly, but surely I plan too much. It doesn't work out so  I'm feeling good now. Like I I am not on the right track for what I want and I'm trying and I'm trying hard and I'm trying to stay positive and I'm trying to find happiness in my daily life not just in my future. So yeah, I feel pretty again. 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	Avoid people at all costs don't talk to any of my friends my family.  Avoid all the people. I know my life. You'll have a much better time being me. 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	My phone and the TV. Numb all the pain that I'm dealing with right now, even though it's only temporary. It's still very helpful and it gets me through every day. 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	I don't feel like there's a point in being kind to people anymore.  I can't think of anything that I could do. That was small.  Considering I do small things with kindness everyday all day. 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	no tomorrow I have to but  he's just a lot of nerves. 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	to finish probation School  longing for  Isaac 
dtyYeMvOCfdlcz0szxyYpGnJkCj2	fine up until recently but  Maybe that was just surface-level.  Everything recently has gone downhill.  My friends don't care about me.  Have and has my family.  Pretty much all the people surrounding me and my life right now don't care.

e6R7g9I8HQQUG1JgD2pcI3Rru2j2	People were being really mean today. 
e6R7g9I8HQQUG1JgD2pcI3Rru2j2	I wasn't able to play any goals today. 
e7P2hD9l2sf4zg0QQFXAisfN7Xp2	Well, I recently got rid of a child that was not lining with who I am but I keep this job because it does so far and it's even if it's not perfect. It's a foot in the door towards what I want. 
e7P2hD9l2sf4zg0QQFXAisfN7Xp2	I am interested in learning new things
e7P2hD9l2sf4zg0QQFXAisfN7Xp2	Well, I have started journaling and I think in combination with the other things I was talking about that like the prioritize thing I think is really important in like putting that together with journaling and having journaling be one of the top priorities I think will help. 
e7P2hD9l2sf4zg0QQFXAisfN7Xp2	Catch negative thinking and use positive mantras to work against them
e7P2hD9l2sf4zg0QQFXAisfN7Xp2	I’ve been more successful than usual at reaching my goals but I  still feel discontent and anxiety because I am not fulfilling what I feel is expected of me and I know many people are able to do.
e7P2hD9l2sf4zg0QQFXAisfN7Xp2	I am artistic and politically active. I’m very caring towards others and like to learn new things.
e7P2hD9l2sf4zg0QQFXAisfN7Xp2	Prioritizing what is the absolute most important instead of worrying about other things and using the forest to keep me off my phone? 
e7P2hD9l2sf4zg0QQFXAisfN7Xp2	Weird, Sensitive, Kind, Political, Intelligent 
e7P2hD9l2sf4zg0QQFXAisfN7Xp2	I'm usually afraid of being thought of his weird or overly sensitive or  drink too much or not being smart enough.  recording us 
e7P2hD9l2sf4zg0QQFXAisfN7Xp2	a good question  My number one priority everyday is meditating because it helps me get the ball rolling and start other things that I want to do. 
e7P2hD9l2sf4zg0QQFXAisfN7Xp2	Creating art that inspires political action in others, including self-care
e7P2hD9l2sf4zg0QQFXAisfN7Xp2	Yes, all the time! My best guess is depression and anxiety 
e7P2hD9l2sf4zg0QQFXAisfN7Xp2	I really love my new job because it's doing what I want to be doing. And I also really love my family because I really supportive. 
e7P2hD9l2sf4zg0QQFXAisfN7Xp2	Yes, because I compare my successes to others and have very high standards for myself 
e7P2hD9l2sf4zg0QQFXAisfN7Xp2	My main goal is to improve my executive functioning 
e7P2hD9l2sf4zg0QQFXAisfN7Xp2	Brush my teeth twice a day 
e7P2hD9l2sf4zg0QQFXAisfN7Xp2	It was hard because I am very self critical 
e7P2hD9l2sf4zg0QQFXAisfN7Xp2	I think those are accurate but I don’t always believe them or view them positively 
e7P2hD9l2sf4zg0QQFXAisfN7Xp2	I think that I would be a lot more successful at Michaels if I pursued them with more confidence.  and  that's it. 
e7P2hD9l2sf4zg0QQFXAisfN7Xp2	So I never really thought of that as having multiple steps, but because normally when I do it, I just stay in bed, and I press my timer so that would be one step. Normally. I only have two step switch is pressed my timer and start meditating like do those the process of the Mantra, but I would like to make it. More of a process in order to get more benefits out of it which would be to actually get up before I meditate and drink some water to rehydrate from the night and probably go to the bathroom cuz you have to go to the bathroom in the morning baby brush my teeth first because I like I would like to pair that with going to the bathroom in the morning. And then either come back upstairs or meditate in the living room sitting up and I would stop the press my timer another additional step. That's like that wouldn't be like an everyday stuff is that I would like to look into a better meditation timer because I'm a little bit disappointed in the one that I have. 
e7P2hD9l2sf4zg0QQFXAisfN7Xp2	Unique, Empathetic, Brainy
e7P2hD9l2sf4zg0QQFXAisfN7Xp2	Brushing my teeth and getting things done and helping myself!
e7P2hD9l2sf4zg0QQFXAisfN7Xp2	Not assuming my loved ones are personally attacking me when they are upset and responding accordingly
e7P2hD9l2sf4zg0QQFXAisfN7Xp2	Probably around noonish or for like 10. I guess. It really depends on the day or after dinner usually like  afternoons are  a little I get a little  tired and stuff mornings. I like mornings and I'm kind of a morning person. But like when I don't like start the morning, right it kind of ruins it. 
e7P2hD9l2sf4zg0QQFXAisfN7Xp2	When I think my loved ones are upset at me I get defensive and make them more upset
e7P2hD9l2sf4zg0QQFXAisfN7Xp2	I’ve always wanted to make the world a better place 
e7P2hD9l2sf4zg0QQFXAisfN7Xp2	I haven't always been this confident but increased confidence comes from learning more about things that I want to learn about and just being myself and being supported by people.

eG9QZoUpGxTEBxr9HMygJ1XCpup1	So what I'm thinking right now is yesterday. I had a pretty rough day because from the morning I was thinking about, you know packing my stuff. I'm in Saudi Arabia right now and I was thinking about going back to Dallas. You know, how about how I have to pack all my stuff.  And all that and on my way to the airport, I checked my email and I found out that my flight has been cancelled because there was a flood in Dubai airport and I won't be able to make it to Dallas that day.  And I was pretty bummed out. I  lost control of my emotions last out on people.  I didn't want to do that though, but I lost control.  end  I thought to myself that I was being stupid.  I thought to myself that I had to let go to let God.  because  Nothing in the SNL control.  And I came back home after the failed travel.  How's things myself or will I do the next 5 days my flight got rescheduled.  5 days after that that is yesterday was generate 13 and my flight got, you know can schedule 2 to January get ready. So I'm going back to Dallas on January 28th.  All these days. I was sitting simply in Saudi Arabia and I had nothing to do and I was thinking about all this thing that I'm going to do after I after I go to Dallas.  And yesterday I was pretty bummed out because I was excited to go home and go back to Dallas, but I was also bummed out that I'm leaving my parents back in Saudi Arabia.  I'm getting an exit from Saudi Arabia. This is January 13th again, January 13th.  so now I'm  sitting here simply January 14th. I woke up.  This is when I start journaling morning, January 14th.  I'm thinking to myself. What else can I do?  piece by piece Arc episode  Inactive because I can't do anything. I just have to sit at home.  and also  we have church on Friday.  And there's this guy who demeans me all the time talking about how not spiritual. I am and stuff like that.  I know I was thinking to myself that my spirituality is between me and God.  I've been wrong. I've drunk tanks.  It's in but I believe that God is more than able.  to wash all that sin away  end  and I'm afraid to speak in front of people.  That's what I'm hoping. That's not right for preacher and I don't believe that.  And I was happy to go back on January 13th because I had attended my last Friday service.  I never happy so that I could I don't have to see the people and listen to their opinions of what I am.  But my flight has been extended to 5 days more and now I have to attend another service.  And I don't know what to feel about it.  I'm happy to attend the service, but I'm not happy to go and talk to certain people in the service.  In the morning when I got up and January 14th of thinking to myself.  You have got if you have made God your priority alpha.  Pain just realize that people.  with all the Super Bowl of all their paperwork against you  trying to entice you to change your priorities. 
eGN8A4mGO9NB5lW5aMyVmJkJQvu1	My New Year's resolution is just to be a better me a better person and that varies from better attitude better characters better decisions better parenting. Do you know I just want to be a better person and I feel as though once I work on me that my circumstances and everything else will just improve the baby better. And so more lighter on my soul and my spirit, you know, and that's really I don't really know what the future brings. So I'm just at a point where it's like, okay, it is what it is. I won't know until I know and that's really just my motto and you know, mine my my staying on everything for the next year. 
eGN8A4mGO9NB5lW5aMyVmJkJQvu1	The Four Agreements I started reading this book and  it's opening my eyes to a lot of things and a lot of different outlooks on life and how we perceive things and I'm just really like interested in reading that and learning more about it. 
eGN8A4mGO9NB5lW5aMyVmJkJQvu1	My family spending time together a bunch of togetherness a bunch of smiles and laughter loves and again I said is Christmas so, you know today is all about the children and I'm really excited to see their faces. Once they see everything that they got for Christmas. 
eGN8A4mGO9NB5lW5aMyVmJkJQvu1	Yes, I actually did and now the only thing on my to-do list was today was to enjoy myself and enjoy my family time. 
eGN8A4mGO9NB5lW5aMyVmJkJQvu1	My Milestone is it'll happen when it happens. I don't have a milestone. I don't have a timestamp of when God wants to bless me with what I want, but he told me and he he put it in my heart the belief in the hope that it will happen. So I'm not really I don't have a timestamp. I don't have a milestone, but it will happen. 
eGN8A4mGO9NB5lW5aMyVmJkJQvu1	Well, I'm thankful for my family my family. My daughter is specially but overall I'm thankful for my family because we went through so many trials and tribulations this year and we kicked its ass. I thought that I would get us down but it didn't and I'm just so proud of my family for all the love in the The Compassion that we have been showing each other despite all of the crazy things all the all of the bad things that happen this year is it's literally been a terrible year for all of us, but I don't know. I don't know. What's what's next in 2020. But something is here it something is coming. Something is on his way and it's big it's huge. 
eGN8A4mGO9NB5lW5aMyVmJkJQvu1	I wasn't really consistent on a lot of things that I said that I was going to do and a lot of things that I put my mind to.  Sometimes I get really stressed out or really discouraged and it bothers me or I look at other people's success and I base it off of why am I not there? But I had to realize that I had to be happy for people because people have their own struggles. They have their own lives. They have their own issues and things may seem perfect, but we don't get how hard other people work for what they accomplished and how many nights that they sat and cried because they felt like they weren't going to get anywhere or they didn't feel like they were consistent enough and I just learned how to be happy for people instead of you know, basing what they got done off of what I'm getting done. We're not on the same journey and that's okay. It doesn't mean that I won't get there. It just means that this is not my time yet. 
eGN8A4mGO9NB5lW5aMyVmJkJQvu1	To feel less burdened. This year was really a terrible year for me. I would say one of the worst years that I have ever experienced. But one thing I can say is that I did change my character and sometimes it's okay that the only accomplishment you made throughout the year was to get through it, you know, so I really am looking forward to the next year regardless of having no plans or not knowing where I'm going to start a where everything will end up. I'm just like ready to just take on next year and that's that's really that I can say that I feel like my face with God and  my face was God has grown amazingly tremendously and I'm proud of that. 
eGN8A4mGO9NB5lW5aMyVmJkJQvu1	Well, I just have to know that not everything happens overnight. Like it really just takes work. It really just takes dedication and we really just has to be motivated enough and believe in yourself enough for you to know that you're going to accomplish what you are what you say you are and what you what you're doing regardless of how long it takes or how hard it gets a how stressful it feels so It's really all about believing in myself. And I feel like that's how I will incorporate these changes into my routine. Just believe in myself regardless of everything. 
eGN8A4mGO9NB5lW5aMyVmJkJQvu1	Well for starters, I feel rejuvenated and positive today is Christmas I get to watch my family open up their gifts with smiles on their faces and that's really going to be a highlight of my day. But the fact of the matter is that me and all of my family woke up today. So I'm really blessed. I feel blessed. I feel positive. I feel happy. I feel just all-around great energy and today will be a great day, and I'm positive of that. 
eGN8A4mGO9NB5lW5aMyVmJkJQvu1	Honestly, nobody I just plan to do everything that I say I'm going to do.  And that starts with me my character.  I find it hard to share news and plans with other people because I feel like they don't work that way and you could be sharing your information with the wrong person. I know they could be wishing bad on you or bringing around negative energy that could just hinder your growth and hinder where you're going, you know, so I just really plan to just be low-key and that's it. 
eGN8A4mGO9NB5lW5aMyVmJkJQvu1	Bayless hair, so  They don't have to come and visit. 
eGN8A4mGO9NB5lW5aMyVmJkJQvu1	That regardless of any things that my family and I go through we all really love each other and we really care about each other and we wouldn't trade each other for anything.  And that's pretty much it. 
eGN8A4mGO9NB5lW5aMyVmJkJQvu1	My day was good simply because my family got together and we all opened up Christmas gift and my daughter got to open up a bunch of Christmas gifts and receive gifts. That was really unexpected. But it really made me happy to see her happy.  My mom cooked we all ate together we laugh together and we just felt loved and loved and I I really appreciate and I'm so grateful for that. I really love my family.

eW6Sc9ZiZCcfjO55E4cZ2jcxRFy2	Well, I feel a lot better cuz doordash called their 1-800 number and they said shit is cool.  So I think I just be wanting a quick cuz I did feel like  I just wanted to say fuck this shit and just go to fuck home and you know what I'm saying, but I really believe that.  After tracking my emotions and then remembering what I'm saying throughout the day, I think that it's just the shit so stressful. I mean really it's like every time every time you I want to start something or just whatever it's like just a roadblock just somebody trying to do something. You know what I mean trying to do something and  You know just the reality is that man that shit just makes me frustrated.  So  You know, I just I think that that's probably why just be like cuz everything.  everything that I work for  You know, I can see evidence. I mean I'm getting better at what I'm doing.  so  I mean everything's right here for the taken. Just want to quit.  at least I think it's just the frustrations of the 
eW6Sc9ZiZCcfjO55E4cZ2jcxRFy2	well, just listening to myself and  you know these messages from earlier.  I really don't understand what the fuck I even say sometime because  yeah, it's definitely definitely.  something that's very very good, which is  Being able to graph all this shit.  and  So yeah still Amen to that.  And but the stomaching you know what I'm saying, Slim.  stomaching  I mean the reality is Dad.  You need I need a better fucking plan. That's the bottom fucking line this shit. I don't trust.  Anything can go wrong with this motherfucker.  Is dependent on reviews is dependent on other people and I don't know why the fuk I get excited like that.  And then you know what I'm saying. I mean reality is money which made  Reality is this month? You know, I don't know how many times through.  Trying to get this shit right to monetize every second.  But the reality is that just can't be my motherfuking main source of fucking income. This shit is some bullshit and this shit is crazy.  will gets mad at you cuz he gets measured gets managed and  finances  You know.  Just having money cash is King.  an amount of money  and not being able to foresee that I bet.  Nothing's going to rain.  You know what I'm saying?  I would have never imagined that and that the Google play some Migos.  I would have never imagined that.  You don't answer just dealing with a bit of frustration.  I mean  I just would have never imagined that.  but at the same time  I mean he'll my kid came in town. I ain't seen that Niger in the year. It was a surprise. I mean what the fuc?  Hey. Whole deal.  I could have went to jail.  Go to jail.  Anything could have happened.  And just you know CNN.  the harsh realities  but I've learned so much.  But only thing that matters is really a paper man. That's all that matters is money.  That's number one, man.  And it's no point to sit up in here and continue to get value from things outside of paper right now paper currency, Slim.  So I mean just drifting off and drifting off.  I'm listening to this later.  I don't know how I can feel that enthusiastic.  that  joyful energized  How could I fucking feel that?  how  I don't feel that now.  I feel disgusted of the thought of a feeling. Joyful.  about this shit  I feel immobilized.  Any second is what could be done?  You know.  This shit is crazy.  But I mean, yeah been able to document and grab every single thing. Yeah. Yes been able to have organization. Yes.  I think it was more so bring him free of fogginess and then not having Clarity was the excitement.  Or maybe just talk and it is shit cuz I feel better.  And I don't know why. Oh boy.  Them boys.  Them boys.  just  I'm just feel all over the place and I it's just stems from  money  uncertainty  I'm I'm in person that I don't like uncertainty.  And there is more certainty.  I don't understand this Rich Dad Poor Dad shit. That's why I keep playing it.  Because life happens shit happens and I have to get the idea of stacking my fucking money.  Is the bottom fucking line of the whole shit?  That's the lesson that needed to be learned and that's why I keep playing that fucking gay man.  Got to stack your fucking paper the bottom line.  And make that shitt work for you.  6 G's  it could have been a different way to do all of that.  What about you have to learn?  I just don't want to get back in a certain place and it keeps recycling itself.  I just don't want to get in certain places and keep cycling self.  I don't want to ever be back to a point like this and Diana by myself back to a point like this.  And that's the whole thing about this shit.  She can't happen.  She absolutely cannot fucking happen.  I mean learning tracking the spending. Okay. Yes, I'm seeing exactly where money is going seeing exactly. I got to put this last one in there now. I have to go spend some more. So I I see exactly the fucking deal.  CMC in exactly the fucking deal  You know.  Mommy I think that that alone would help tremendously I think God Alone  would help  thank God alone. I think that's why I was excited.  But that really would help tremendously. I mean I said game-changing have it right there to be quite honest because it just escalated from there than another abs and you know, I'm just concerned with the fall off and and the preventive measures why the fuck the shit keep happening?  Bye.  I mean, I guess I got to continue to learn until I get it and I mean cuz I've learned a lot through this do these values is no question about it.  Viva be at a place now in arms and there's no question about it. But the reality is that there's no certainty on anyting.  Does none whatsoever.  Is absolutely done whatsoever.  and that's what I can't stand that's why you that's why I'm like stacking my paper if I ain't trying to work for anybody else, but the reality is that I think if I wanted to me you had to learn but now would have you saying that you learn I'm saying that  man at this rest stop. I need to be on the laptop. I need to see what's up with their story about a job. It's almost immediately. I need it. I need to see what's going on out here in this world.  Cuz I think it's a lot of ignorance.  But I don't believe it's my fault though got anymore.  Maybe I did have a reason to be excited. But the reality is that did this not stomaching this shit. It's is not cool. It is not cool. It is not cool. Don't ever fucking think I should cool ever ever think that shit School. I'm sorry, man. Make that shit real you cuz you got no reason to be excited right now. 
eW6Sc9ZiZCcfjO55E4cZ2jcxRFy2	I'm thinking I want to make more money during the time that I'm working. Now, you know what I'm saying? I feel like  I feel like if I stay on this doordash it I can get like 150 a day I think minimum.  Staying with it not taking too many breaks. You know, it's one break. Now. I need to break the charge the car again. I didn't you know, I thought about that. So I mean repetition. I'll have some type of really good plan. Maybe just getting charged even though it was charged, but I don't have a plan.  I just feel so obviously still frightened.  but  I mean, yeah because everything there is no certainty or anyting.  All I know is I have to continue to act.  And there is a list of things going on like a divorce like I miss my son.  On top of this shit.  so  boy  But what can get me out of it as leverage in mind my time better?  And I know that I can do that. So that's really what I want to concentrate on.  Leveraging my time better, you know, that's what has to happen is not is not a one.  It's a necessity. It's a need.  It has to happen.  so  And I know I know how to do it. And I know I know how to do it very easily.  But I need to act.  And I know it's going to be a trial and error, but I need to make it tangible.  All right. 
eW6Sc9ZiZCcfjO55E4cZ2jcxRFy2	Today at the moment. What's on your mind?  yasso  I feel absolutely amazing. I feel like the Rich Dad Poor Dad classic flow. I feel like I've had enough repetition to understand how to survive now.  I believe no matter what happens. I'll be fine because of that understanding.  I just consistently generating income no matter what is the key.  and secondly, you know just leveraging the time that I have I mean  Fuck it. I work a job. I have the opportunity that while I'm generating income to still take time to get the resume together and main thing is generating income and an organization around that being able to track what gets measured gets managed.  what gets measured gets managed so  Been able to measure my thoughts with this. I've been able to measure every single penny that I spend.  And it looks like I'll is a high level of comfort man. Just knowing that everything is documented. It gives me it feel like it's my mind Clarity it when things are clear and organized and I know where everything is and I know where things are and I feel like I have a grip of myself. I think that's the whole thing. I think just simply organized in everything and knowing where I'm at.  You know takes the worry away cuz I know I can look exactly where I'm at exactly having a graph and an outline of all my actions and then able to take inventory of it for some reason excites me gives me peace of mind lets me know that as long as I'm graph.  What song is this measure and I think mathematically that's who I am anyway, so just knowing that you learn through repetition.  and being able to stomach  uncertainty frustration  fear  And to still get up shower take care of myself.  And go right back at it.  With even a better game plan.  I just feel really really really good. Now. I just want to produce I know what that nowadays. I have 900. I know by tracking my app. I'll get better and better through repetition. And I know that I'll be able to take care of whatever build any take care of and that's number one on my mind bitches to women to.  Definitely. But take care of myself and my finances right now.  amen

eWbMrQaWX0fpWYUaMgzzTJk2dSY2	To find happiness within myself and not try to look for it elsewhere 
eWo8CjvtruRbJ8sSdmpxPnRsBgN2	No weld.  I want to be my full and honest self my whole self.  which is  slightly troubled altia troubled stressed  bad anxiety  I guess I don't want people to see that side of me.  Halliburton  But in reality, that's who I am.  I guess I just want them to.  Except that part of me and help me.  Get through it.  And I feel like a burden. 
eWo8CjvtruRbJ8sSdmpxPnRsBgN2	My girlfriend got mad at me because I got mad. I wasn’t talking to her so now she’s not talking to me
eWo8CjvtruRbJ8sSdmpxPnRsBgN2	I feel like I have a lot less anxiety attacks.  ironically, you would think that your friends would help you with your anxiety, but I lost a lot of anxiety attacks and I quit talking to them and not as worried about what people were thinking about me cuz  I cut off.  Most of the people I interact with so I guess simple math there. 
eWo8CjvtruRbJ8sSdmpxPnRsBgN2	I feel like they're not giving me what I need. What great question. Oh my God.  How he like they're giving me what I need. I feel like a  clearly communicated what I need from them witches, you know support in attention and honestly, I haven't seen any of that at all. I feel like  I say something in our little group chat and that falls on deaf ears. I can hardly tell if anyone is listening to me. The subject is always change under someone else, which I hate. I hate when people change the subject from me to themselves. That's not what I need and I feel like  I couldn't have explained that any clearer. I've had this conversation with them so many times before but I guess I haven't.  sufficiently  confronted  then what these issues?  So is a partially my fault, I'm sure.  But a person with social anxiety.  It's going to keep these sort of conversations or any conversations to a minimum of bare mineral.  So, I don't know what they're thinking.  Maybe no one cares.  if I leave 
eWo8CjvtruRbJ8sSdmpxPnRsBgN2	She hates it I’m sure. God forbid I get mad her even if she says she can handle it and wants to help me. No one wants to help me
eWo8CjvtruRbJ8sSdmpxPnRsBgN2	Because I’m just too much to helped. I need constant attention and affirmation 
eWo8CjvtruRbJ8sSdmpxPnRsBgN2	another great question  I don't think they'll necessarily like taking a placement of me even if I do if they do.  I'll be around to know.  Might even be my girlfriend, but I feel like they wouldn't want.  They want to want me to be any there to be there any more causing drama.  I feel like I'm such a burden on them.  Ignoring them acting like something's wrong.  Making a so evidence, but it's so hard for me to hide. I hate feeling fake I hate.  Not being upfront and honest just for other people's.  convenience  I deserve just as much as everyone.  2  live a life where I feel like I'm accepted. 
eWo8CjvtruRbJ8sSdmpxPnRsBgN2	When people see you to what they did want to be seen us.  Santa's question  I think people don't want me to be seen as  a burden  and then they probably like they point out so many times that I'm the crazy friend that I'm the dramatic one.  and I don't think they  want that anymore and I don't think they care for that ever.  I don't feel like I'm fully accepted.  They could be in my head. Who knows but  Those are my feelings. 
eWo8CjvtruRbJ8sSdmpxPnRsBgN2	Fuck me for having feelings and wanting to feel regardless of my faults. I don’t deserve that. Do i???!
eWo8CjvtruRbJ8sSdmpxPnRsBgN2	No, it's been really helpful. Thank you.  Such a great app. 
eWo8CjvtruRbJ8sSdmpxPnRsBgN2	I took myself away from the situation as I can bear it anymore.  I just went to an isolated place and just as by myself and I feel like  so alone with my thoughts doesn't really help me.  Exactly what I need, but what else can I do about?  It's not working out. 
eWo8CjvtruRbJ8sSdmpxPnRsBgN2	I went to exercise. It worked pretty well. It calmed me down but then I got back to my apartment and my partner got mad I was ignoring them.
eWo8CjvtruRbJ8sSdmpxPnRsBgN2	I feel like I made peace with my situation with my friends. Well.  I guess a peaceful resolution in my head I guess.  maybe a compromise is a better way to put it but  I'm not exactly where I want to be but  I'm okay with  Not having them here with me and knowing why and acknowledging why.  But it doesn't make me upset anymore. I feel like I've been doing better since I haven't been talking to them just doesn't give me as many anxiety tags as I did when I was talking to them, which was everyday. 
eWo8CjvtruRbJ8sSdmpxPnRsBgN2	I would say.  Hi.  I'm so and so  it's nice to meet you.  depending on the setting  at work  I would be like  I like.  I have loved Excel.  it gives me more control over my  Day to day life, especially my finances.  personal  I would say.  sad  I'm a very ambitious person.  I know what I want and I'm trying my best to get it and was always do when I don't remember what I don't.  Was really hard for everything that I have I deserve everything.  Diane  I never stop.  to be better  I find my faults.  everyday  I constantly trying to be better. 
eWo8CjvtruRbJ8sSdmpxPnRsBgN2	My girlfriend is upset with me. She’s not talking to me because I asked her to get my shoes before we left and she was going to... but she forgot while she was walking to get them... i got upset because she can forget anything I ask! So I can only rely on myself? I feel like your partner should take care of you to some extent. She leaves me at her house without food. She gone for hours and I’m left on my own. I have no one here. I’m disappointed. I imagined myself being with someone that took care of me better. Now, she’s mad at me because I got upset! That’s so backwards! It happens every time - she takes the reason why I’m mad and then makes it her problem. As a person with attention problems, I hate that. 
eWo8CjvtruRbJ8sSdmpxPnRsBgN2	I am a personal value and have a right to be treated as such. 
eWo8CjvtruRbJ8sSdmpxPnRsBgN2	I  really want to find self confidence and self value self-worth cetera.  I feel like I've lost sight of how  valuable I am  that's my anxiety has gotten so bad. I think I'm constantly embarrassing myself.  Or making myself look bad.  I need to be okay with who I am. 
eWo8CjvtruRbJ8sSdmpxPnRsBgN2	I feel like  anxiety and overthinking is what keeps me up. I can't stop working out. My screen is constantly eyes and there's no way I can go to sleep without settling this in my head. 
eWo8CjvtruRbJ8sSdmpxPnRsBgN2	I feel like  just  going on.  a social Hiatus from my friends  and just  not having to speak with them are feeling obligated to speak with them with me and her better.  And would have been nice going through all that anxiety.  being obligated forcing myself to speak to them and I really didn't want to to make  my girlfriend happy  would have been nice to have her at least come for me, but she's always busy. 
eWo8CjvtruRbJ8sSdmpxPnRsBgN2	I'm excited about eating chips with you at any time with my girlfriend.

eWo8CjvtruRbJ8sSdmpxPnRsBgN2	That my girlfriend is a jerk and I hate having feelings
eWo8CjvtruRbJ8sSdmpxPnRsBgN2	I think it’s fucked up my girlfriend doesn’t want to talk to me like she doesn’t want to have a girlfriend. Makes me want to scream. If I knew she was going to get mad at me, I would’ve kept my feelings to myself our entire relationship. She says she can handle it but she obviously can’t. It doesn’t matter how I can help me because I guess I’m just permanently broken. A burden on everyone. I should just live in isolation so I’m not bothering anyone but myself!
eWo8CjvtruRbJ8sSdmpxPnRsBgN2	I want to just drive in circles leave my phone at home and make her worry about me.
eWo8CjvtruRbJ8sSdmpxPnRsBgN2	I would really like to go back to exercising. I feel like a really cleared my mind at the same time. It took me from anger to head.  Maybe  I think I would want to make soap. Yeah, I want to make soap crafts.

Obviously I got mad but I just stayed quiet. All I said was, “you said you were getting them...” and she got onto me saying “please don’t be mad at me right now”. Honestly, I can’t stop myself from being mad. She doesn’t understand how hard it is for me to control my emotions. I’ve talked about this with her already. I wish I could. This is not fun for me! My life my health would be 100x better if I could just stop being mad. But I can’t! I don’t have that luxury! No one, absolutely NO ONE understands and it’s so frustrating. Now she’s punishing me for being mad. I’m already punishing myself THANKS! What a great life I live.

I feel like I've fallen out of the group.  And I'm okay with just taking myself out.  But it makes my anxiety.  So terrible almost unbearable.  To leave myself a lot of these spots.  But I'm a bad person.  for doing  I thinking this way about them.  100% feel like  Are my friends anymore?  But they're here.

And I don't know why and even my best friend does that I didn't think she would do that.  And it really hurts and when they say that I'm speechless I'm like, what do I say back if I say something about people. Going to come for me? I'm just not that confident. 
f5PSmEc0apXI2lKW8waDTA7ltL63	The person that can help me with this.  is  my best friend  Kylie  she can't help me with this cuz she's  she talks bad stuff about the girls and then goes back to them being friendly friendly and then comes after me. She can't help me. She just going to backstab me. 
f5PSmEc0apXI2lKW8waDTA7ltL63	Well, Kylie always comes back to me.  She can be really nice sometimes and sometimes you can be really hurtful and rude and mean and not just to me but a lot of people.  Kylie gets back at me when she needs my help defending her.  She comes back to me when I when she needs might have defended her. Right now we haven't talked in a week or so. 
f5PSmEc0apXI2lKW8waDTA7ltL63	my dad  he left he's not here.  He left when I was a baby. 
f5PSmEc0apXI2lKW8waDTA7ltL63	I didn't really have any new thoughts. I had thoughts about what I was going to eat today. That's something new. I thought if people were going to come up to me and say weird things cuz that's what usually happens. There's a lot of bullying going on with me. People don't like me.  So yeah. 
f5PSmEc0apXI2lKW8waDTA7ltL63	I would love to remember my best one of my best friends lyric. He came out to me today. He came out as bi and I was really happy cuz I knew from the start but he was like really happy to tell me and I was so happy for him. That's something that I really would like to cherish forever. He's really one of my best friends. 
f5PSmEc0apXI2lKW8waDTA7ltL63	Advice and keeping me in a good mindset
f5PSmEc0apXI2lKW8waDTA7ltL63	It would be the best thing no insults no sadness just peace
f5PSmEc0apXI2lKW8waDTA7ltL63	I really didn't accomplish anything, but did I feel like my day was a success?  Sure, not fully but like it was okay. It was a success that I got through with nobody coming up to me and insulting me. That was a success. I was really happy about that.  Yeah. 
f5PSmEc0apXI2lKW8waDTA7ltL63	well  physically  I don't know. I don't exercise a lot.  And I'm not really good.  in like the Wayne Department  like I'm an 11 year old girl and I weigh 94 lb and I don't really like that. 
f5PSmEc0apXI2lKW8waDTA7ltL63	Not really anything related to food, but I'm thankful for the friends that I have the family that I have. They have a roof over my head that I have a comfortable bed to sleep on blankets pillow and education. I love all that. 
f5PSmEc0apXI2lKW8waDTA7ltL63	Well many people have been talking about me and saying bad stuff and insulting me and bullying me and doing everything that I hate. Even when I ask him to stop its really annoying and it really hurts my feelings.

f5PSmEc0apXI2lKW8waDTA7ltL63	Well, this is how I classify somebody as being a good person. They need to be loving. They need to be kind. They need to be respectful day meter not talk people behind their back. Do you need to not be like rude and disrespectful?  They need to accept people for whatever they are and they just need to be a good friend and general. 
f5PSmEc0apXI2lKW8waDTA7ltL63	I want to learn how to stand up for myself. Yeah, I want to learn how to stand up for myself.

f5PSmEc0apXI2lKW8waDTA7ltL63	Well, it really depends on what type of friends.  I'm the type of girl that I just want to be liked and be popular even though I know that it's really not the best thing to have.  So I don't really consider them friends, but I do cuz they're popular. I don't feel grateful for those friends are really don't think I deserve them but  they really changed my life. They insult me. They hurt me. They make me mad they make me sad but I really am grateful for the friends that stand up for me for the friends. I've been there since day one for the friends that will do anything to not let people hurt me.  That's what I'm thankful for. 
f5PSmEc0apXI2lKW8waDTA7ltL63	I don't know. I don't really know that. 
f5PSmEc0apXI2lKW8waDTA7ltL63	We see each other almost everyday I’m fine with that cause I love her
f5PSmEc0apXI2lKW8waDTA7ltL63	It’s way more of a humorous 
f5PSmEc0apXI2lKW8waDTA7ltL63	Ok so these girls they are really popular but also rude! They pick on me they insult me and they are so rude and they are rude to my girlfriend too and they are now dragging my best friend to hate me too

f7DpdRo01ET3KjbdMaWMBPrRNhH2	I deserve the love that I am given. 
f7DpdRo01ET3KjbdMaWMBPrRNhH2	Actually nothing really today. 
f7DpdRo01ET3KjbdMaWMBPrRNhH2	Possibilities are endless. 
f7DpdRo01ET3KjbdMaWMBPrRNhH2	I deserve feel good about my body. 
f7DpdRo01ET3KjbdMaWMBPrRNhH2	Because I got up and started my morning with a good workout.  Play accomplished one of my goals for today. 
f7y5x5XdT4fD0ag1KiTWka1BDWA2	I have a solution to solve this “PROBLEM.” I will not be back to this house after what blew up today. I am sick of being disrespected and being the 2nd option!
f7y5x5XdT4fD0ag1KiTWka1BDWA2	My mental health and daily routine(s)
f7y5x5XdT4fD0ag1KiTWka1BDWA2	"By deleting:
Facebook 
Messenger
Getting rid of any phone numbers associated with them"
f7y5x5XdT4fD0ag1KiTWka1BDWA2	Because! I have looked up to this person as a best friend, and this whole time they cared absolutely nothing about me!
f7y5x5XdT4fD0ag1KiTWka1BDWA2	Being disrespected when you do so much for someone! For that person to take sides with a Female he just fucks and cares nothing about is a shitty thing to do. 
fBIw0udNnke0mQ4NxYflYEcFrTF3	I looked it up.  And I know I need to journal to write I mean like to do so, I just found this. 
fCtzAqnKdtX6gqJ1NSKonCFoAjS2	lately, I've been feeling thankful for an to she  has proven to understand me and where I'm coming from and recognize that this program is  a little underrepresented in the professional Harry is sometimes but we can understand each other cuz we both had a long work history and think similarly on a lot of things but we also challenged each other to think different about our thoughts and ideas in a reasonable way. Thanks for the nice. 
fCtzAqnKdtX6gqJ1NSKonCFoAjS2	I think the only person in my family I feel thankful for is my sister, Melissa.  But it could be for narcissistic reason, you know because we get along so well together but I suppose I'm also grateful for my grandma. I feel like I don't get to display that as much but she's always  been very comforting for me.  Even though we can't communicate directly. I can tell that she really enjoys my company of my presents. 
fCtzAqnKdtX6gqJ1NSKonCFoAjS2	Pink something that inspires me is working for under-represented folks the people who don't have the privileges in this world and helping other people recognize how their unconscious biases for things end up pushing them further away from obtaining equity in this world. That's a really hard thing because it's hard to do that without making people feel bad because they did something wrong but truly the only wrong thing you can do is not have that uncomfortable conversation and recognize where you fit in. 
fDYu0MtYg8Nh0CCybOEHmlMtExu2	I would say I was sorry for everything

fR6bwSxSQKPzIp8VcXTUoeMo00W2	Because you don't know when you're in the Army. It's kind of tough to  I guess when you have an obligation, you're kind of tied down by them then having the freedom to explore yourself personally and professionally just isn't really in the cards. 
fR6bwSxSQKPzIp8VcXTUoeMo00W2	Baby, open-minded by trying to see how they can be additive to discussions rather than necessarily.  Dismissive, I guess it's the entire idea of Improv. 
fR6bwSxSQKPzIp8VcXTUoeMo00W2	I think when you are collected you really  get a chance to put your best foot forward and whatever you do, if you're not collected, then you're really always scared around.  Don't really know.  Or half a firm grasp on your mental state.

Part of what? She said was also about how to incorporate the philosophy of improv, which is the entire idea of yes and within daily conversations.

fR6bwSxSQKPzIp8VcXTUoeMo00W2	I guess philosophy is really the study of logic and  to be able to understand logic better helps with understanding an argument as much as it does help with improving the way you make arguments over time, especially in writing and speech.

fR6bwSxSQKPzIp8VcXTUoeMo00W2	A good way to do that is to ensure that you have a very clear understanding about what tasks within the app needs to get done together when they finish with or not. We want to wait for them to finish before running the next instruction. I'm being able to have some clarity and explicitly defining that within the co-pays would be fantastic in trying to build a good concurrency model around and IOS app 
fR6bwSxSQKPzIp8VcXTUoeMo00W2	Not quite as much considering the fact that I feel like my entire life weeds down this road of pasta pendants. I cannot really imagine what life would be like without you know, I'm supposed to people that I have in my life as well as just a privilege that you know as a side effect of what to me. 
fR6bwSxSQKPzIp8VcXTUoeMo00W2	Telling people around me that I truly appreciate them. 
fR6bwSxSQKPzIp8VcXTUoeMo00W2	Just some level of physical engagement with something else really just being taken away from the thing that's causing the stress.

fR6bwSxSQKPzIp8VcXTUoeMo00W2	Just having the privilege of being able to you know, so just leave the country to go live somewhere else to experience life somewhere else to immerse myself fully until what life has to offer. I think you need to be in a pretty privileged position to  be able to afford such a lifestyle. 
fR6bwSxSQKPzIp8VcXTUoeMo00W2	Only the entire idea of newsletter platforms. I just never really thought that I could have it means of reaching an audience and be able to ride in the more stream-of-consciousness candid way to explore ideas and have people message email and reach out to me to discuss about them. It's it's truly something special. 
fR6bwSxSQKPzIp8VcXTUoeMo00W2	Managed to accomplish most of what I set out to do during the start of day, managed to get most of my revision done on time for my test tomorrow!

fe1WZuSUEUezbCysuN20OKlO7Nb2	For recreating how I used to be I had no success has being the old me acting like the old man doing the old things.  Doing old ways doesn't make me successful just holds me back. 
fe1WZuSUEUezbCysuN20OKlO7Nb2	How many setbacks did take for me to recover?  well  I had a lot of setbacks and every time I had set back and Made Me Stronger.  And setbacks don't help me really recover the hold me back.

fe1WZuSUEUezbCysuN20OKlO7Nb2	I think it's important to have fun with projects because if you're not having fun with it, then what's the point of doing that you have to enjoy what you're doing and there's a saying if you love what you do, you won't work a day in your life.  And if you're not having fun and enjoying it, you shouldn't be doing it. 
fe1WZuSUEUezbCysuN20OKlO7Nb2	Sometimes I read about it in my journal that helps me or I come up with ways to fix why I'm feeling overwhelmed. I try different techniques to relax myself for writing is one of my main ones.

Learning more about this religion and I'm really looking forward to you know, being happy and actually being able to be happy finally and living the life. I've always wanted to have  and I was so amazing. I've never really been happy before but I have a feeling this year. I'm really going to have a lot of opportunities to do what I love and work on photography is really focus on me. 
fe1WZuSUEUezbCysuN20OKlO7Nb2	Probably because I'm really bad, but probably my phone in my journal really like my journal.  I like a lot of materialistic things.  I don't know because they helped me get through a lot of things that keep my mind off the negativity that's going on this world. So  I do like a lot of things in my phone is one of the many things that keeps my mind off of negativity. 
fe1WZuSUEUezbCysuN20OKlO7Nb2	I tend to get overwhelmed about things easily and I dwell on things a lot. I have a hard time letting go of the past and I will dwell I think about it over and over and over again. 
fe1WZuSUEUezbCysuN20OKlO7Nb2	I have to go to a meeting a Jehovah Witness meeting. 
fe1WZuSUEUezbCysuN20OKlO7Nb2	Well today I woke up and I had a Bible study which is very fun. I had a lot of great conversations with people and we talked about how to not procrastinate and stick to doing what we said we were going to do and to finish the task when we set it.  My hair okay day. I kind of got a lot of things I needed to get done and I started love myself again. 
fe1WZuSUEUezbCysuN20OKlO7Nb2	Well, everything excites me the fact that I'm able to actually be happy and love the life that I'm living is amazing. I've been waiting for it for so long and working so hard on it. It just excites me to be able to finally have it.

fsNk1I1y4pQToM9tyJ3MOIQtXG33	Absolutely. She has a yoga playlist that I really enjoy. 
fsNk1I1y4pQToM9tyJ3MOIQtXG33	Yeah, it's really helpful because then I can use the voice activation piece and I can just talk and get my thoughts out with overthinking and writing. 
fsNk1I1y4pQToM9tyJ3MOIQtXG33	I was mostly just looking on the Ops for something helpful. I also use another app, but I thought it wouldn't hurt to try something that I can talk to. 
fsNk1I1y4pQToM9tyJ3MOIQtXG33	I'm incredibly thankful for my fiance for staying next to me even when it's not easy.  He's been by my side for 4 years. So if he was going to bail it probably be by now. 
fsNk1I1y4pQToM9tyJ3MOIQtXG33	although my books cuz I have so many that I don't read as much as I'd like to so that's  a challenge that I am grateful for because I do push myself towards it another challenge. I feel grateful for his group therapy. 
fsNk1I1y4pQToM9tyJ3MOIQtXG33	Real thankful for my dad because he's very supportive and everything.  Also and thankful for my mom and the way that she's changed and I'm obviously very thankful for my fiance because he saved my life. 
fsNk1I1y4pQToM9tyJ3MOIQtXG33	I am so grateful for my cell phone. Really I hated it for a long time. But now I'm realizing it's such an amazing way to connect and I've made so many friends. So I think between Instagram and Facebook because I started talking to Sidney Moore and she's so very much like me and she's been through so much more so I can only imagine the type of friends that we could be in. It just makes me really happy every time I'm able to use like my voice command on my phone. Actually I think is one of the most grateful things I'm for because then I can talk and I can be out there and I can still be myself and feel like I'm speaking instead of just like writing it down. 
fsNk1I1y4pQToM9tyJ3MOIQtXG33	I'm really grateful for all of the therapeutic.  apps that I can get  so my cell phone and my computer are the number one things. I'm thankful for. 
fsNk1I1y4pQToM9tyJ3MOIQtXG33	My books and my crystals I'm very grateful to have those in my life. 
fsNk1I1y4pQToM9tyJ3MOIQtXG33	Honestly, I don't find I'm really thinking about much other than the fact that I want to work harder on myself and change more but it's hard because I'm very comfortable going slow. So I feel like it's just really annoying that I want things to go faster and I'm slowing them down. Anyways, the depressions not as bad.  It is suicide a way, but I just don't feel like ambitious enough to do anyting. 
fsNk1I1y4pQToM9tyJ3MOIQtXG33	Taking a nap and getting my nails done tomorrow.  Looking forward to feeling feminine.  again 
fsNk1I1y4pQToM9tyJ3MOIQtXG33	Probably all of the crystals and healing.  materials that have gotten recently  and  my cell phone because I have a journal. 
fsNk1I1y4pQToM9tyJ3MOIQtXG33	I think that's really hard. But I think my favorite thing about myself is that I truly love deeply with my entire heart. 
fsNk1I1y4pQToM9tyJ3MOIQtXG33	I brush my teeth wash my face and I got my nails done. 
fsNk1I1y4pQToM9tyJ3MOIQtXG33	Today I had a nice shower and I washed my face.  And I made the bed so that it was nice and comfy, but my shower was my number one self care. 
fsNk1I1y4pQToM9tyJ3MOIQtXG33	I found some really amazing music on Spotify from Lisa's playlist. I was super happy to find that it was very relaxing. 
fsNk1I1y4pQToM9tyJ3MOIQtXG33	And my favorite part was getting my nails done because I feel really pretty with them done. 
fsNk1I1y4pQToM9tyJ3MOIQtXG33	I like to talk and Kayden and planning what we want to do tomorrow. 
fsNk1I1y4pQToM9tyJ3MOIQtXG33	I am very logical and he's a lot more emotional. 
fsNk1I1y4pQToM9tyJ3MOIQtXG33	Hopefully very bright and happy thus far anytime. We've had a fight we've fixed it. So.  I'm looking forward to our bright future. 
fsNk1I1y4pQToM9tyJ3MOIQtXG33	We really like to find Lake good Netflix specials. We enjoy going for drives to find like abandoned houses and stuff. So that's really fun. And we both really like to find that gold trinkets. 
fsNk1I1y4pQToM9tyJ3MOIQtXG33	My day was actually pretty shity to start with but I clean up my room and organized myself a bit. I watched a good documentary and I talked to Sydney a lot, which was nice. I feel like I have a really good friend in her.  So it's been pretty Rocky. 
fsNk1I1y4pQToM9tyJ3MOIQtXG33	Today, I need a set of earrings for myself and I got my nails done.  And then I had a nice breakfast with Kaden. 
fsNk1I1y4pQToM9tyJ3MOIQtXG33	Jealousy and people that are trying to fuck this up for me. 
fsNk1I1y4pQToM9tyJ3MOIQtXG33	So it only takes a few minutes for me. 
fsNk1I1y4pQToM9tyJ3MOIQtXG33	I think that's my voice command on my phone made me feel more relatable.  Because I was able to actually communicate myself to not only journals and apps but my friends as well and I can send them my voice messages where they can hear my enthusiasm my happiness my excitement for them and I I really like that so I think it's made me honestly more relatable because I can talk more. 
fsNk1I1y4pQToM9tyJ3MOIQtXG33	People usually don't want to give too much of their emotional side. I find like money is nothing to some people like it would just fine like that's cool. But I find emotionally people have a hard time giving in and I made a really good friend in Sydney. So  Some people can't do it, but I think we can. 
fsNk1I1y4pQToM9tyJ3MOIQtXG33	Gap my plan is to get some things ready for Sydney some things definitely for depression and strength and her courage because she's such an amazing human that I just want to help her more than unfortunately. I haven't really been able to help and she's helped me amazing. So I think I'm going to do some special little  gifts for. She definitely needs 
fsNk1I1y4pQToM9tyJ3MOIQtXG33	I really hate having it hooked up so that people can get ahold of me all the time. I like my solitude in my privacy. So I keep it turned off. 
fsNk1I1y4pQToM9tyJ3MOIQtXG33	That doesn't make sense, unfortunately. 
fsNk1I1y4pQToM9tyJ3MOIQtXG33	It sounded she had a pretty rough day. But when we started talking she was pretty upset.  Luckily, she just started taking some shrooms. So she was starting to feel a lot more confident and talking. So I think her day started sad unfortunately. 
fsNk1I1y4pQToM9tyJ3MOIQtXG33	The best part of my day was between finding an amazing musician with lovely music from the Sanskrit religion and language. And then also my favorite part of my day today was talking to Sydney. 
fsNk1I1y4pQToM9tyJ3MOIQtXG33	I have really bad anxiety, and I'm very hyper and he's a lot calmer and more down-to-earth and I finally even each other out with the logic and emotion. 
fsNk1I1y4pQToM9tyJ3MOIQtXG33	I like having deep conversations. 
fsNk1I1y4pQToM9tyJ3MOIQtXG33	I really hope to connect on a deeper level before we have a baby. 
fsNk1I1y4pQToM9tyJ3MOIQtXG33	Hopefully we go to the mall go to the sex shop and get a nice breakfast and have a good sleep. 
fsNk1I1y4pQToM9tyJ3MOIQtXG33	I'd like to make a necklace.  Or bracelet or keychain anything really?  and  tomorrow is Thursday. So I think my goal tomorrow will be to go through my clothing more. 
fsNk1I1y4pQToM9tyJ3MOIQtXG33	Asking for help. Definitely I ask for help and a lot of people reached out to me which meant a lot. It was really beautiful for.  people that reach out and want to help and not expect things in return which of course I'm going to be returning so much positivity, but  It felt really amazing. I'm so thankful for my friends and the challenges that I face and the friends. I have to be there with me. 
fsNk1I1y4pQToM9tyJ3MOIQtXG33	I'm usually really thankful for this, but your questions are weird tonight. 
fsNk1I1y4pQToM9tyJ3MOIQtXG33	I'd like to start passing out hot drinks on me and Street to the homeless and the less fortunate. 
fsNk1I1y4pQToM9tyJ3MOIQtXG33	Not 100% because I didn't do a whole lot of what I wanted to do. But at the same time this morning, I guess yesterday morning Kaden and I got a lot done. He did a lot more than me, but I feel like I got some tidying done and I did a lot of journaling through my phone. So I think that's good. I could use some better time management though. 
fsNk1I1y4pQToM9tyJ3MOIQtXG33	They were Rocky for a while, but after the winter solstice and the struggles, they went through with that. I find that I'm finally allowing people in more and I'm getting closer and speaking my truth. And I think this is the year that I speak my full truth. So  the rocky but in a positive way. 
ftFFTLazUvbYkQcwwMYVfec6qdt2	I just lack confidence.  And I don't really believe in myself and I don't really have a purpose. 
ftFFTLazUvbYkQcwwMYVfec6qdt2	My day was pretty boring and I didn't do a lot.

I feel really stupid for how drunk I got the other night and  it doesn't help dealing with my husband.  And his issues and it just makes me sad.  And I feel like I don't have anybody that I'm all by myself.  But I also just don't ever do anything.  I'm just feeling really overwhelmed. 
gDrXpf0RL7QEIZ4WteDygacVPvz1	Because I'm staying up late.  and  either watching TV or playing on my phone or just  not able to sleep.

gELpSpXHNyahHGhFRe7crCUmWis2	She never really trained me. It was the weirdest thing in the world when I had a meeting.  Where she told me to go on ahead and ask her for training after I'd been there for 6 months. It made no sense. I've been here for six months and all of a sudden you want to train me.  After anytime, I asked a question of you. You're telling me to Google it like that makes no sense. You took absolutely no time. No care. No consideration for my line of work what I did and now all of a sudden because you're promoted you care about my line of work and what I do after for 6 months, he told me to Google everything and then I see you there really training somebody for 15 to 20 minutes, but you know his America and I'm not supposed to believe that this individual is prejudiced. She barely wanted to answer any of Vanessa questions same with me. Oh wow, and I'll conveniently we're both dark and we're both black but this is America and until I can find  My Niche what I like what I want.  Filling homes would be great. But then I'm dealing with the same stuff. So what is it? Is it me, or is it the person? 
gELpSpXHNyahHGhFRe7crCUmWis2	I'm looking forward to seeing the VP. I'm excited. I'm definitely going to make sure that I'm on the phone the entire time.  I'm also excited.  to get some coffee  coffee kind of makes me excited to spend the small things lately that  make me excited. I'm excited to have a cup of coffee. I'm excited to go for a walk.  And I'm excited for this new Journey that I'm going to do for myself.  I was also really excited that yesterday after I shared with my mom the following night that I was kind of scared to be in the house on myself.  Yesterday I wasn't nervous to be in the house by myself, and that was a win for last night. 
gELpSpXHNyahHGhFRe7crCUmWis2	I'm grateful to be able to wake up this morning.  I don't know everybody in the world and I don't remember the statistic for how.  often people died, but I know that there's people who didn't wake up this morning, but I did and I think that  that's something I should be grateful for because I have the opportunity to live another day at the opportunity to go to work and make money regardless of the dollar amount. I'm still making money to be able to pay for my car.  To buy snacks to have a gym membership.  And that's what I'm grateful for. 
gELpSpXHNyahHGhFRe7crCUmWis2	Well, I am very frustrated with what's going on at work. I feel like I've been putting my best foot forward and I'm not getting anywhere. I also have a slight issue with my manager. I feel like I'm being treated differently than everyone else. I literally just watched her train somebody on how to put together a resume and I was never trained on that. I am feeling a certain way about this. I'm getting really emotional and it's making me sad. I am so upset and I'm just really tired of feeling his ways this way at these places and at these jobs I am just so  frustrated  I'm so upset.  I'm just really upset. I'm really upset and I'm tired of feeling like wherever I work at. I'm not good enough.  People always say that a job doesn't Define you.  But I'm not sure why I always feel like my relationship with my co-workers with my manager is like my job. I don't know why I feel like it does Define me when it literally says not it says but there's a wonderful saying it says your job doesn't Define you so why do people feel this way? 
gELpSpXHNyahHGhFRe7crCUmWis2	Work will be all over the place today. That's usually how it is. The first thing I'm going to do this morning is to equip pipeline for Alpharetta. That's really been on my mind and it bothered me that we only got two people in out of a wreck. I feel like 15  they were laying people off and firing people left and right. So that is the first thing I'm going to do is make and Alpharetta pipeline early this morning just until about 8:15. So I'll give myself a good solid 45 minutes to rush do that. Then I'll commit a good chunk of time to the business operation analyst. I'm going to make sure that I take my brakes I go for my walks and I eat my lunch today.  Are the p is going to be in today? I just remembered so I'll be getting up probably at 5:15 after I make this.  And get in the shower get dressed find something nice to wear but make sure that I've had my tennis shoes so I can go for my walks today. I want to make sure I prioritize myself I get my brakes.  So my to my two brakes and I want to make sure that I get my lunch in today. I've been burning myself out because I sit at my desk all day. And I don't know do I expect other people to come to me and say hey take your lunch take your breaks. I do because that's the world that I've worked in for so long, but  This job is really making me prioritize myself and I will make myself my first priority.  I'm a hurry up and hop in the kitchen in.  Cook some lunch for myself. I might do that in four minutes p.m. Cook my lunch real quick and then hop in the shower. I might need to do that. That way I can have some fresh vegetables and some fruit.  And then I'll take my vitamins today. 
gELpSpXHNyahHGhFRe7crCUmWis2	I don't know. There's something that I should remember.  That way I can be grateful every morning that I do wake up.

gQpwvcuHeHgixLHja0PKogLSFe33	well in a dream like  is just a migraine and how it happens anywhere, but the person who it was it's a boy named Lester at my school and it was about like how we was together like dating but I don't know if these signs are real like it's letting me know that he actually likes me, but I don't know. 
gQpwvcuHeHgixLHja0PKogLSFe33	Helping my self rebuild because it takes a lot for someone do it alone

gS4qyogORVMBeMAmTaAfUC51gT22	Because I’m scared of not having any. My friend is gay just like me and is the only gay friend I have. We both have homophobic families and because of this trauma we share we are close but after today I don’t think she actually cares for my wellbeing. I’m just nothing to be. Not close to valued. I hate that no matter what I do i always find myself here. Alone.
gS4qyogORVMBeMAmTaAfUC51gT22	My name is Abigail I’m a closeted non-binary lesbian but recently I don’t identify with either of those identities cause I’m trying to turn myself cisgender and straight.

gSX7ufE2agNhj1LpVav69yMvLc63	Back home. Three hours away about 
gSX7ufE2agNhj1LpVav69yMvLc63	I think we just find each other interesting and trustworthy 
gSX7ufE2agNhj1LpVav69yMvLc63	Generally staying in my room, sometimes under a big pile of blankets. 
gSX7ufE2agNhj1LpVav69yMvLc63	I like hearing about how things are going back home, and it makes my day better to hear that he’s happy.
gSX7ufE2agNhj1LpVav69yMvLc63	Someone I work with mentioned the flu was going around 
gSX7ufE2agNhj1LpVav69yMvLc63	I’m happy to have my cat in my room 
gSX7ufE2agNhj1LpVav69yMvLc63	I just saw it on the App Store
gSX7ufE2agNhj1LpVav69yMvLc63	I think I experienced any new thoughts. I only get to see her hang out with anyone too much. But that was my own doing. I took a nap. I've been feeling super tired lately. So I haven't really had the opportunity to like sit down and think too much I guess. 
gSX7ufE2agNhj1LpVav69yMvLc63	I had my physics class and we’re on the electricity unit. There were some new things to think about there.
gSX7ufE2agNhj1LpVav69yMvLc63	Taking care of like my basic needs feels like a chore but I’ll eat dinner 
gSX7ufE2agNhj1LpVav69yMvLc63	I like my college, but no matter what I do I can’t get excited about things anymore. It just seems like there’s no point in anything anymore 
gSX7ufE2agNhj1LpVav69yMvLc63	Nothing, really. I’m looking forward to getting to the end of the week.
gSX7ufE2agNhj1LpVav69yMvLc63	You’ll be fine by tomorrow morning
gSX7ufE2agNhj1LpVav69yMvLc63	I always like waking up with Brad. It makes me feel quiet and at peace.
gSX7ufE2agNhj1LpVav69yMvLc63	When I walk from class to class I try to keep the pace pretty quick, I get my 10,000 steps in usually
gSX7ufE2agNhj1LpVav69yMvLc63	I’ve tried everything, I think. Nothing seems to work out 
gSX7ufE2agNhj1LpVav69yMvLc63	I’m not happy with the way I’m living, really. I’m just kind of tired of everything 
gSX7ufE2agNhj1LpVav69yMvLc63	So I had some classes today in the morning I had.  Physics all my headache was there I think I did. All right. I probably got one or two questions wrong, which isn't great because it was a lot of 7, so I probably either got like an 85 or or 71. I'm not sure yet. But we'll see you soon. Either way. I'm it just the first quiz. I'm sure I can get back on track and it's better than I was doing last semester anyway, so and I understand I think the content a little bit better than last semester is while I feel like I'm a little more used to it. But anyway after that I had talked to you about us and I also had a quiz in there and I'm like, I'm pretty sure I did a lot better on that one. Then the other I got to leave early, which is great. I'm going to get some work done. I got my computer science homework done a little bit early, which is good and the bad side. I got that done early because I was trying to procrastinate on my physics assignment because I'm going to be super busy this weekend. I'm going to Billy Joe.  Call with Brad and so I won't be able to finish it or get help from the pqrst or anyting. So that's something I really need to pretty much start and finish tomorrow night. I'm not looking forward to it, but I only have one class. So I'm hoping tomorrow will be good. 
gSX7ufE2agNhj1LpVav69yMvLc63	It’s not over yet, so I don’t know 
gSX7ufE2agNhj1LpVav69yMvLc63	Like I like I said before I got to do some work, I got my computer science homework finished. I still have to email him about a little a little problem having but it's not major and that's June 28th Sun super far ahead. Other than that. I didn't know that you're too much. I still have to do a reading for class tomorrow. But other than that, I don't really have anything super pressing on the agenda today. It was mostly just to go to class Justin quizzes and then just chill out for a little bit if I'm if I'm feeling really ambitious. So I'll take notes on a physics chapter maybe tonight is what you have to do that tomorrow night and I can focus on homework. 
gSX7ufE2agNhj1LpVav69yMvLc63	No, I have a reading to do, but I have to read it before I go to bed because I put it off.
gSX7ufE2agNhj1LpVav69yMvLc63	It’s always hard being left alone again, and I’m not really looking forward to classes tomorrow.
gSX7ufE2agNhj1LpVav69yMvLc63	I have some classes to go to, and some homework to finish up on top of studying for some quizzes I have tomorrow.
gSX7ufE2agNhj1LpVav69yMvLc63	I have panic attacks foo l
gSX7ufE2agNhj1LpVav69yMvLc63	I'm really looking forward to getting to spend time with my mom and Chloe this weekend before Chloe goes abroad and I won't be able to see her for a while. So I'm really happy. I have that chance at their birthday to I haven't thought her anything. I'm not sure what to get her butt.  If I'm honest to it completely slipped my mind, but  I'm really looking forward to being able to to see her. She's really important to me. 
gSX7ufE2agNhj1LpVav69yMvLc63	I’m always happy to see Bradley.
gSX7ufE2agNhj1LpVav69yMvLc63	I’m mean to him and he tolerates it 
gSX7ufE2agNhj1LpVav69yMvLc63	I’ve realized that I’ve adopted a similar sense of humor sometimes 
gSX7ufE2agNhj1LpVav69yMvLc63	No, I’m happy with the way things started.
gSX7ufE2agNhj1LpVav69yMvLc63	I’m not sure I know what you mean?
gSX7ufE2agNhj1LpVav69yMvLc63	You know, she's family and her and I've been closed for for a really long time and I don't really like tell her everything cuz I don't know I I get uncomfortable. Sometimes letting people know about stuff. It's kind of happening behind the scenes. I'm like, I kind of have a way that I like everyone to see me but she's very familiar with how I grew up then she knows how to behave for a really long time. So I kind of feel a little more comfortable around her like letting her know how how things are going. Even if I can't necessarily disclose stuff and I'm really really grateful for that and she's important to me, you know, just family and close to her. I love her so 
gSX7ufE2agNhj1LpVav69yMvLc63	We like to make sure the other is doing alright that day, and I’m usually pretty interested in what he’s been up to anyway.
gSX7ufE2agNhj1LpVav69yMvLc63	I took a really great nap. 
gSX7ufE2agNhj1LpVav69yMvLc63	We talk pretty often. We usually text everyday, even if it’s just a few check-ins.
gSX7ufE2agNhj1LpVav69yMvLc63	They can be overwhelming sometimes, but I don’t have a problem with any one of them individually. They’re all very nice to me.
gSX7ufE2agNhj1LpVav69yMvLc63	I don’t really have any goals. I think I could be a little more fun to be around, since lately it’s been hard for me to keep things up. But I’m not really sure he cares all that much, we don’t see each other in person excessively anymore.
gSX7ufE2agNhj1LpVav69yMvLc63	Sometimes he comes to me with things he needs to talk about or advice or work he needs help with. I try to help him and be supportive with everything that’s going on in his life.
gSX7ufE2agNhj1LpVav69yMvLc63	No, but I like it when I have it. I know I have better things to focus on, like school or work, but at the end of the day having a relationship has made me happier, I think.
gSX7ufE2agNhj1LpVav69yMvLc63	We both genuinely like each other’s personalities. Any complaints are minor on my side at the very least 
gSX7ufE2agNhj1LpVav69yMvLc63	I was settling in for bed in my dorm 
gaL7bujjRgbhUoFLXGPiySFPBWe2	They were happy to see me 
gaL7bujjRgbhUoFLXGPiySFPBWe2	"Nothing

gaL7bujjRgbhUoFLXGPiySFPBWe2	What Jenna did to Allen is really bothering me. 
gaL7bujjRgbhUoFLXGPiySFPBWe2	"Just worried about money

gaL7bujjRgbhUoFLXGPiySFPBWe2	Finding something for dinner 
gaL7bujjRgbhUoFLXGPiySFPBWe2	No, it’s our anniversary.  We went to lunch, then came back to Jenna and Bernie trying to get her truck.  I finally got dishes washed and bed made.  He didn’t feel good so I fried New York steak for dinner.

gaL7bujjRgbhUoFLXGPiySFPBWe2	She said the stress was getting to her, but does she really think that being separated/divorced is going to be less stressful???
gaL7bujjRgbhUoFLXGPiySFPBWe2	"Hopefully taking a shower

gbJXRPAiucYvc0PKXx1ELnEHa022	I found it in the App Store when searching for a journal. 
gbJXRPAiucYvc0PKXx1ELnEHa022	So it is Tuesday January. I think 21st. I'm sort of lost. It's been a holiday weekend yesterday with MLK on Monday.  It means pretty I'm driving into work right now at 6:20 in the morning for a light or day of got three miners this morning, but I wanted to just check and because it's been a little while and wanted to talk about improvements and wanted to be grateful for improvements.  I have been on fluoxetine now for a couple of weeks and I've noticed a huge difference especially in the emotional aspect and tearfulness that I've been experiencing.  As my depression and I just had a. For the last week. So it lasted a full seven days last Tuesday to yesterday and I had horrible excruciating pain on day one wanted to be laid up in bed and couldn't be I was on labor and delivery but I got through that but amazingly emotionally I was okay and I'm I don't even think I cried the whole week and usually I'm crying everyday something hits me and I'm super emotional.  So I think from that respect that helped I will say this weekend was stressful yet. Again. Michael worked all weekend 684b Saturday and Sunday and the kids are just maniacal. I mean they are.  just  they ruined everything that their hands touch and if I have to pick up yogurt one more time off the floor or a chair off the table. I mean, I really thought I was going to lose my mind and I'm not even OCD it's just  It's exhausting the amount of stuff that you have to clean up.  and  I left the kitchen clean, but the living room this morning was just trashed. I mean, there's just toys over almost every inch of the floor and it's stressful to look at I think one thing I wanted to hone in on today that I just wanted to like make an observation about with my eating.  Yesterday was Monday. So it's supposed to be a low carb day. I mean I did so well, I went to an Orangetheory class in the morning Nikki met me up there. We had partner workout. It was great. I did really really well until about 3, I checked on my carb level and I had like 30 carbs and I was like, oh perfect. I still have room for 20 and something went off in my brain where I thought it would be okay to eat animal crackers as the kids started swarming around the animal crackers bed.  Like sharks and all of a sudden it turned into a Feeding Frenzy and I'm in there with him eating animal crackers and not just for five like 20 plus.  So a couple of servings of animal crackers and this is like pure sugar pure carbs and now I have ruined my low carb day. And so I might as well just turn it into not a low-carb diet make myself eat low carbs on Tuesday and Wednesday. So then I ate granola and skim milk and had two pieces of bread and pimento cheese and it just snowballed from there.  and  I've got to figure out what works for me like either I can have four to five animal crackers and that's enough which we all know the animal crackers do nothing to satisfy hunger. So or you just don't eat animal crackers and that's really what needs to happen. But I think what goes on in my mind it's not fair the kids get to eat animal crackers other moms would get to eat animal crackers and not gain weight. Why can't I eat animal crackers with my kids?  Here I'll get them and peanut butter. That's healthier. These are the thoughts going through my head.  And then before I know it I've eaten 22 animal crackers with a half of a tablespoon of peanut butter and I've ruined my day of low carb. And now I have to figure out how to reframe my mind to say. It's okay start over.  so  I really need to figure out how to manage my mind in the middle of the kid chaos because they do they come in and they swarm like sharks and they are bringing me these packages of food to open for them. They want me to feed them feed them feed them feed them and then I get so stressed out in the process, but I start eating the food to  So there's that.  But anyway, I'm hoping this week's going to go. Okay. Obviously, we're working towards this site visit on January 27th. I got a lot of things to go over in my mind today about what I want the residents to know to prepare for we're going to meet with them on Friday right before the Monday site visit and just try to debrief and explain everything again.  I'm worried, but I'm going to be in prayer about it this week and just know that God's in control of this and it's out of our hands.  You know, it's it's only to the best of our ability that we can tell them what's offered to them.  But that should that be on that that's it and they have to know how to answer the questions.  So it's weird. I've liked not allowed myself to get stressed out about Bob Trott. Mostly there's a lot left to be done for that. But at the same time then I just have to back up and remember. Hey, remember you're just going to let it be what it is. And we've got a hundred and eleven people signed up right now. I imagine we'll get a lot more the day of the way we did last year, which is a little bit stressful because I don't know how many people I have in terms of  volunteers  anyway  I think that was it but basically to bring it back around I started off this brains out with gratitude and I am grateful. I think this medication is working. Yes. I snapped at the children's home this weekend, but they probably deserved it.  I don't like it when I get all worked up. I definitely screamed a couple of times because they just  get under my skin with the things that they do. I mean the boys through a box of tampons into the toilet not once but twice this weekend twice.  And guess who gets to go fishing them out drying them off.  anyway  All right. I'm going to focus on my eating today. I'm going to eat low-carb. I'm going to work out tonight.  I can do it today.  I'm out. 
gbJXRPAiucYvc0PKXx1ELnEHa022	So it's almost 7 a.m. I'm driving in Friday. I have a full or j a couple of hysterectomies laparoscopic cystectomy.  And I did a brain dump last night.  About the issues with Michael yesterday and just was in a very unforgiving.  You know, it just seemed like his tirade was one too many and that I needed to start calling a lawyer looking at options for separation or divorce to get my kids out of the situation.  You've never laid a hand on me. He swears. He never will.  But that doesn't mean that the verbal abuse.  Is okay.  He came up last night. I think it was around 7:30 and we had like a  long conversation while Olivia was asleep in bed next to me.  Probably an hour and a half. He stayed upstairs crying bawling apologizing the usual, you know, the usual I feel terrible for what I did. Please forgive me in a typical perpetrator remorse.  And I believe that you sorry and I believe that he doesn't want to behave this way, but it still doesn't negate his behavior.  And in this instance, neither one of us can really identify a trigger for why he lashed out and got just enraged and seconds.  And yes, it was frustrating that the boys were crying and Cole's that they were having tantrums and wanted to get out. They were hungry. It was noon, which is not the ideal time to be out running errands on the day after Christmas and he is taking them out to the car to try to deescalate them. And when I got out there they all just started screaming again, and he's like they were fine until you showed up and he gets frustrated because  They all want me when I'm around because guess what I'm their mom, and I don't get to see them very much because of work.  so he started talking about how hungry he was and we just need to find food and I downloaded this yesterday, but  it wasn't necessarily hunger that hadn't been raised and it's not like every day the kids don't cry. So that wasn't knew it wasn't new for them to have a 2 year old tantrum.  But it was like everything that escalated to the point that like it was just today or yesterday. He just couldn't go because I didn't handle the crying the screaming the tirade of the kids and being hungry all at the same time.  and  it was just bizarre to me because for the last year his coping skills have actually been really good.  He just has sort of remain calm under those circumstances. I'm usually the one who gets anxious when they're all fussy and you know driving me nuts.  But I've never ever ever put my kids In Harm's Way.  and  I explained to him last night that if I wasn't working today, I would have left.  How to take in the kids and driven away and I don't know how long I would have been a way.  But unfortunately, I have a duty to my patients. I have to go do their surgeries at to take care of them.  I explained to him how scared he made me I explained to him that when we got home. I was worried. I was going to walk back there and find him with a gun in his hand.  I did go and look in the safe.  At some point yesterday, I think maybe after he got up from his nap. That's what it was.  To see if he had put that gun together because he leaves it apart.  and it wasn't put together it look like it has been moved in the safe, but  I picked it up and it wasn't loaded.  I told him all of this that I'm worried about him committing suicide that I'm worried about him being so enraged and incapable of clear thought that he could hurt me or hurt the kids.  And again, he swore I would never do that. I said how do you know? Rage that I thought at any moment, he could drive off the road and run us into a tree or whatever flipper car kill us.  I know trust in him. I knew I had no idea who he was.  And that bit of rage and that moment it was the worst day.  Of my life that I can think of.  And I had zero control.  and that car  the whole way home  Be quiet and pray.  I prayed a prayer over our house this morning the angels to protect my kids. I texted my mom last night and said, please please just one of you call and do a wellness check on my  and I'm much more at ease this morning after our long talk last night that he's  Fine and then he's not going to hurt them.  But the thing is you just don't know when he's going to become possessed again when?  you know spiritual warfare is going to sit upon him and then all of a sudden he's like  just a demon. He's a damn it when he does this.  I talked to him again about his need for Christ. I talk to him again about all of us are broken and that we need righteousness and it just bounces off his stone cold chest.  He doesn't understand.  And I just pray that God gives him the ears to hear and a heart to accept it because there is no other power that will be able to allow him to take it in.  I mean it is like  he's like saw like he has scales over his eyes. He is death to the word.  And it just may need ripped off the scales need ripped off he needs to see he is so blind.  And that is his root cause yes, he may be bipolar. Yes, he may have  Intermittent explosive disorder, but you know what if he had Jesus I think it would be a little bit better.  I talked to him about his need for counseling our need for counseling and excuses just flew from his mouth. Like they always do. Well if I don't know what's triggering this then how can counseling help?  To which I replied sometimes talking through things allows you to discover things. You didn't realize about yourself allows you to discover triggers allows you to discover ways to cope even if you don't understand was triggering it.  It allows you to not treat your family the way you just treated them today.  our dog Annie followed him upstairs when he came to talk to me and  that dog  his loves unconditionally.  And he broke down petting her going untreated this dog. So poorly and yet she stands here wanting to love me.  Why?  And I said dogs aren't like humans.  She loves you whether you  You know don't feed her don't give her water. Don't let her come inside. Don't run with her. Don't play with her. Don't talk to her. Don't pet her. She loves you.  I don't know. Why either honestly.  But humans aren't like that.  and we have  less than 13 years left with Olivia and the house.  Which can seem like a long time, but it's a blink of an eye.  And it 18 when she goes off to college. She may never ever want to come home again.  If he keeps this up.  It broke my heart at lunch yesterday when he stormed in and went to bed and work. She's sitting down with the boys eating lunch. And she said Mommy.  When daddy is mean to us like that? It means he doesn't like us, huh?  I broke down. I lost it. I cried in front of her I couldn't help it.  And I just told her Livi your Daddy loves you very much. His anger. Sometimes he was very stressed out today, but it doesn't mean your Daddy doesn't like you and it doesn't mean he doesn't. Love you.  And I told Michael this.  Because I need him to know that this is affecting his kids the first one at the age of 4.  And then I'm concerned she's going to be counseling and therapy.  I never experienced this kind of yelling and rage at the age of 4.  And I can only imagine what that would be done to me as a small innocent child who loves life to watch someone she loves me hate this way.  It disgusts me.  It makes me want to.  Get out get out.  He can rip it to me all day long.  But I'm not Xavier.  I'm not a savior and I can't fix them.  He has to figure out that his broken is can only be mended.  by the one  the one who showed up in a Manger  lived a perfect life for 30 years.  And then walked up carrying his cross.  To the hill with nailed to it.  and died and excruciating death  for us  to cover our sins to blanket all of our iniquities.  And I credited as righteousness.  We don't deserve it and he doesn't deserve it.  Visa gift to him if he'll just take it.  I get the weirdness of it all.  You know, I liken it to a Jehovah's Witness trying to tell me that I should believe their way or you know.  A Muslim trying to tell me I should believe what they believe.  It's weird at first.  And you go that's fine. You can believe that it's just not for me. Not for me.  The thing is  Jesus Paid It All  and literally all to him we owe.  And if he hadn't.  Show me the truth.  Throughout my life. I wouldn't believe it either.  But he gave me eyes to see and ears to hear and a heart softened enough to recognize my own skin and realize my need for a savior.  And that it wouldn't be by my own works that I would.  Be better.  And I think that's the point that Michael's missing.  It's not just by consciously doing better that you get better that you get all fixed.  Hey, I can make a laundry list of things that I can start January one and start knocking them off my to-do list and I'll feel better for a while. I'll feel good about myself and all the things that I'm doing.  And then I'll start to fail again because sin Creeps in.  And I just can't maintain that pace.  You can't either.  And our marriage is not going to enjoy this Behavior.  And I told him that I don't want our marriage to fail because I don't I do love him and I care about him. We have children together for crying out loud beautiful beautiful children who deserve a mom and a dad.  That love each other that love them that aren't divorced.  That are loyal and that pushed through.  The right now they're being subjugated to very vicious Behavior evil Behavior.  And I just don't know how that's going to affect them long-term and I'm scared for that. For them, but they are protected and shielded.  From this penetrating their little hearts and turning them into stone.  I pray that if anything God uses it to his glory and that he  teaches them how not to behave.  Probably don't want to be when they grow up to be adults appearance.  I can't remember what all I said yesterday.  I can't remember if I voiced that Michael literally said out loud on her way home. I'm just going to go home and kill myself.  I reminded him of that last night and he said well, I would never do it. I'm all talk.  And I just don't know how I'm supposed to know whether he means that or not whether he means that he's going to go in and kill himself or not.  When someone acts as crazy as he acted yesterday.  It seemed that he was homicidal as well.  We are experiencing intense spiritual warfare in our family.  And the thing is I carry the guilt and the weight of it all because I chose to marry him.  I did not know the extent of his.  psychological pathology when I married him  And I believe that.  He believes in God and he knows about Jesus and we're going to work through that and it's going to get better. I believe that lie.  Even though I knew deep down in my heart that is not how it works.  But I wanted to be married and I wanted to have kids.  It's the most important thing in a marriage lied.  And I am paying the price, kids are paying the price and I wouldn't ever trade them for the world because I love them so much and I could not imagine that Olivia been in Wesley in it.  but I take the blame for all of this because  it's my fault.  And that's a really significant burden to bear.  a really significant burden  anyway  Praying for a better day today than yesterday.

gbJXRPAiucYvc0PKXx1ELnEHa022	So it's 5:30 on Christmas day and I'm laying in my car room hoping that it continues to remain relatively quiet.  I'm just thinking about what a year. This has been and the first half of the year was amazing and I was very successful with work. I was very accessible with orchestrating the Bob. Try in 2019 has very successful with healthy eating and exercising and losing weight and reflecting now on this switch that occurred seemingly in July after the residents graduated in June. I felt like resident graduation in mid-june of 2019 with the Pinnacle of my healthy eating my healthy exercise me feeling great about me and where I was and I kind of used it as  a landmark  of success and feel like that was the start of my self-sabotage. Everyone was telling me how great it looked. Everyone was telling me how skinny I looked and while those compliments felt great. They scared me because  I just kept thinking these compliments aren't going to last forever and I'm going to get fat again and people are going to start to look at me and go well that didn't last long and literally.  six months the next six months went by and I am  I weigh more at the end of 2019 than I did at the beginning before I even started this whole process before I started faster way to Fat Loss.  and I'm just  frustrated and don't know where to start.  for January 2020  Obviously, I want to lose 20 lb I've gained since July and obviously I want to lose more than that.  When July happened I started.  Like when I went on a road trip with the kids in the RV to Pittsburgh, I had a conference in Pittsburgh in August. We took the kids to Amelia Island, and it was like one every single night. There was some big trip. We were eating on the road. We were eating lots of food and September an hour in Chicago for a conference. It was my birthday in October. It was our anniversary and we traveled in November. It was Thanksgiving and December we travel to Disney with the kids for a week and  The following weekend. I was supposed to be running this half marathon in Kiawah and I'm still depressed about it and it's not even like it was my fault. I had a knee injury diagnosis in October and I don't think I've exercised since October.  There's not a healthy picture in my photo log of.  of you know some healthy food which when I cook healthy food I take pictures of it and there's not a photo of me in a sweaty selfie and  For the last two-and-a-half months. I have been just living in this slump.  And in November, I started Wellbutrin, so that was about five weeks ago.  At 115 mg daily thinking I'm depressed like this is depression. This is what depression feels like. I'm crying all the time. I'm sad. I'm guilty. I want to take care of myself, but I have three children to take care of and it seems like enough all the boys kind of took this turn and started staying up later. They're bad times. Later. I couldn't work out like I used to be able to because he used to be bedtime 6:30 Jennifer goes upstairs to work out. And now the time is like 8 to 8:30, and I'm exhausted and I just want to go to bed and so  I'm just trying to figure out a navigate this new schedule.  and  I really want a positive energetic fresh.  new start in January and I have eaten terribly through the holidays just because  self-sabotage is and it just snowballs and snowballs and I get more depressed and more upset about my food choices and I'm already in so deep that I'll just go deeper because I don't even feel like I can have  Redemption from it  and the thing is this isn't new.  It's a process that I have gone through my entire life.  I remember being fat when I was 8 years old.  8  and I have fault.  This battle for almost 30 years.  and now I'm terrified about teaching my children about health and exercise and nutrition and  I don't know. I just bought this book on Amazon called Red Light Green Light Eat Right or something and I hope that I can teach my kids.  how to make a choices without having to hide eating or feel guilty or negative in some way about their choices in about their bodies  Olivia so different for me. She's like tall and lanky and skinny, and she  seems to be able to eat whatever she wants and  Tri heart, sometimes she'll go two days without eating which that was never me. I was always eating.  but  I am worried that a flip is a switch is going to flip in.  Show all of a sudden.  Wake up a BS or they'll be some problem because all she wants to do is eat sugar and I don't know.  how to keep from being it's like two extremes I either like I'm going to be a control freak about her food in her intake or I'm not going to say anything and  Just hope that she gets it and I think there has to be some compromise some in between and I've got to learn how to do that and what to do.  And gate for being so stressed out about it.  I just want to move forward.  And the next 6 days whenever January 1st rolls around and be prepared for.  change and be prepared for  moving for pressing on forgiving myself for the last 6 months  Finding exercise that is so fun and exciting to me and that my knee can tolerate. I mean the orthopedist told me I should never run again. I should never do a squat again.  And that was really hard to hear because the thing I enjoy doing is jogging and doing hit workouts in Orange Theory workouts and half of Orangetheory is running and squatting.  And I felt a little relief because my Orangetheory coach land reached out to me and told me to come back and told me she'll work with me through that. I could cycle or walk or whatever. It's just  35 and I want to be able to do things.  Freely, and now I'm set back.  I Googled premenstrual dysphoric disorder the other night.  I'm convinced that I have it.  I pretty much have like 12 of the 15 symptoms and it dawned on me that when I quit birth control back in June because I was bleeding incessantly and getting chronic migraines like eight day migraines that I could not stop.  IO  That's when all this mood stuff started and when the eating change happened and I just wonder you know, is this where my switch flipped and I flipped a switch or however you want to word it. Is this where Going back to this is my usual hormonal cycle pre birth control, which has been years since I've been on birth control.  But my body is acting really weird.  Two years almost two years. Postpartum from the boys and I just couldn't stand bleeding two weeks out of the month, and I couldn't stand headaches.  In the migraines are gone. I don't have headaches anymore.  I tried getting back on Nuvaring in September and low 8 day migraine immediately got off of it and no headache since no headache in 3 months. I have estrogen headaches.  And for some reason my body is bleeding like crazy on birth control. So Michaels going to get a vasectomy at the end of January.  and  I don't know. I I looked up. You know, what ssris are good for pmdd.  And seraphim, which is fluoxetine, which is Prozac seems to be one of the best and so I'm going to switch.  and do that  anyway  I don't feel like Wellbutrin is done anything and  maybe the Prozac will help at a huge component that I notice and that Michael's noticed is this sense of overwhelming anxiety that just takes over my body like I become quickly and raised quickly ill-tempered. Just quit to jump on people. I love I noticed it with my husband with my children with my mother and it does seem that a couple days into my. All get better. But that time. At least that week before leading up to my. Is like do not touch me do not talk to me.  I'm just so on edge and I have never  experienced anything like this before until now and it is out of control anxiety. I feel like I am so out of control and so overwhelmed and just being pushed under a mountain.  Of tasks and things Weighing on my shoulders like I'm drowning. I feel like I'm drowning.  And yes, I have a lot going on but I've always had a lot going on in my life. So why now? Am I unable to handle it?  And I do have a history of panic attacks in med school.  And when I began working out and taking better care of myself that went away and never had to take anxiety medicine.  think I lost 30 lb in  just made myself to take care of myself.  I got to do that again. I mean, I haven't had a panic attack, but I am starting to feel that sensation of panic Rising.  And it's a very cyclical is very seems to be with my periods this time, which I don't remember noticing back in med school.  Maybe I've always had pmdd and I just never knew it.  anyway  made a list of things that I really want to try to tackle in 2020.  I want to journal at least talk Journal like this and work through my problems. I need to see a counselor. I really do. If not weekly every other week.  Still work through stuff get some feedback.  They don't come home. I just pour out stress on to my husband and my family.  I need more quality time with my children. I feel like the time at home I spend is me shaking Livi off while I'm on my phone or my computer because I'm constantly doing work.  I have to let go of the scheduling aspect of my job and give it to someone else.  I'm going to be taking over as program director in July and I have to let go of that.  I want to go to church more.  I want my family to go to church more.  I want to eat healthy. I want to exercise and enjoy it. how to do  Mean it and accomplish it.  I feel satisfied for a minute.  And I want to learn what is going on in my head.  That causes me to self sabotage that causes me to fail when I've had so much success.  That's all. 
gbJXRPAiucYvc0PKXx1ELnEHa022	So today is December 26th. I can't believe it's been less than 24 hours since my last Brain dump and I feel completely different today than I did yesterday.  Opposed call this morning. I  Call Michael as I was leaving and mind you yesterday was Christmas order 24-hour holiday yesterday was great. I got a lot of work done because it wasn't busy and then I got woken up every hour all Christmas night to deal with consults and Admissions and a last-minute delivery at 6:30 in the morning.  So I'm tired, right? I'm tired and I leave but I'm going to push through I'm going to have a fun day. I'm going to let you know the kids are tolerating it. We're going to try and go and do the shopping and  the first plan is for when I get home from I have to go to an hour-long grocery shop at Publix get home take a shower cuz I'm totally disgusting from call and then  you know what with the whole family Michael and myself the kids are supposed to go to Kohl's and return something and see if we can buy another coupe car because Ben and Leslie are constantly fighting over the one that they got from Santa sharing is not their thing.  so  been an hour trying to buy healthy food for the kids. I was on the internet last night reading that green light Red Light Eat Right book.  Trying to figure out healthy options for them, which I had constantly stressed out about. Yes, they're skinny, but doesn't mean they won't be fat later when they're not eating healthy. So I'm trying to Institute that in our household.  Which by the way Michael has been completely stressed out and he's freaking out that he's gained 30 pounds this year, but doesn't want to do anything to change his diet or exercise is I want to start doing those things to do to lose weight. So that's fine. I get that. I've been there before I'm there now where I just don't have the motivation so that I have the motivation for my children. Anyway, I get home with all the groceries. I put all the cold stuff away. I'm exhausted and I feel gross. I just want to get in the shower the kids didn't get a bath last night. What a surprise he didn't pay them. And so I'm like, let's go get a shower. You're all dirty. I'm dirty. Let's go get a shower and then I'll come back and finish this.  And he gripes and decides that he wants it done right then and there and I'll tell him know I'm going to the bathroom and I don't come back and I'm in the shower with the kids. And so he's Furious when I get out and he's cleaned up the kitchen and he's moved all the groceries out of the way. And so that was the beginning of the worst one of the worst days of my life.  so  we  go to Kohl's the children are just fussy from the beginning. I have to feed them constant snacks in the car right over we get into Kohl's the line to return my pants is extremely long. We walk completely around the store the boys don't even last 15 minutes and that store there like about to tear up the place. So I said Michael out with them living I get in the return line, we buy a couple of things I spend like $10 and we get out of there and he is like just in this horrible. No good very bad. Let's go eat worms mood and says that he's hungry and we need to go eat some like great Chick-fil-A's right across the street. Let's go. He's like, I don't want a plate and like fun, you know, what do you want? And that's fine the kids like Chick-fil-A will go to Chick-fil-A. Of course the lies like 12:15 on the day after Christmas. The line is like around the block and it's not moving and I said, let's just go do something different. That's fine. So he gets on the line. He's worth ten. Washington Road and Libby starts crying and jabber not about how  Do you really want to go plane to fly and explain to her? We're not going inside. You know, we're going in the  To go line and has a fit he can't handle that. He completely blows up and says I'm going to the other Chick-fil-A. I don't want to hurt him like that was going to be busy too. Well, does it matter he still get keeps going keeps doing what he wants to do, even though he doesn't want to eat Chick-fil-A Olivia still very upset because she can't go in Chick-fil-A and the Chick-fil-A is going to be just as busy if not busier the one by I-20 and Washington we get there.  It's horribly busy.  He freaks out.  kid stuck behind cars screams  and  is like revving his engine angry?  And I have a complete panic attack in the car. I feel completely unsafe. I feel like our kids are unsafe.  I don't know what to do. And please let me drive. He won't let me drive. He yelled at me and said you're not driving my truck and I said, please drive safely home.  So, you know, he's a very safe driver, but when he's angry, he's like all other person I literally feel like my husband is either a child or demon-possessed when he gets this way.  And yes, he has intermittent explosive disorder. It has been way better on his SSRI on Zoloft, but  I looked back in the last episode was August of 2018. And the one before that was March of 2018 is been over a year since he's blowing up like this. This is one of the worst I've ever felt because I've never  I have I have been concerned for the safety of my children and myself but not actively in a car where I felt like he could decide to run into a tree any minute if you wanted to run into the back of a car.  so  we get home after some crazy driving and passing people and revving his engine.  Turn to display his anger, and he doesn't pull into his usual place in the garage. He drove straight up to the driveway gets out. Does it help get the kids out go straight to the back room and shuts the door.  And this first thought that comes across my mind is he he's going to shoot himself. And the reason I felt this way was because in the car, he's he said well, I'm just going to go home and kill myself literally out loud and let me don't let me forget the how language he use the entire time from Kohl's to Chick-fil-A to the next Chick-fil-A to home. I'm pretty sure the f word was used at least 30 times in the car in front of my children with extremely enraged angry.  Burbage  so  it was a situation where my anxiety got so out of control. I became so panicked and so overwhelmed that I began to feel like I could not breathe and I about lost it.  We got home and I had this sense that he was going straight to the back to get his done.  So I quickly got didn't Wesley out of the car put them at the table because they needed to eat. They were starving.  and  I'm sitting here running through the Litany of do not call 911 do not call my mom. Do I call a friend?  People are going to think I'm stupid people are going to think I'm overreacting people are going to you know, or they're going to overreacting and they're going to come and then he's going to be angry at me.  So I just went knock on the door and I said what are you doing and he was peeing and he was getting in bed. He was going to take a nap and he proceeded to take a 3 hour nap.  He was crying in bed before he fell asleep and he wanted me to come lay beside and then I refused I just I don't even I didn't even know how to respond to this.  Like how am I supposed to immediately quickly get over this tirade this tantrum and forgive when he just put myself and my children in danger.  I should be leaving him for that.  Any probably normal woman in this world would have divorced him already.  What am I doing?  We were all just verbally abused in that car.  And if he was still hungry if that was his problem. Why didn't he come home and eat he went to bed?  so  by the way, I'm hiding in the playroom in the dark. Olivia is outside crying because she can't find me and I have moved them of my things upstairs and I'm not talking to him that I have told him that I'm sleeping upstairs tonight. I just can't I can't and I need separate space. We ate at two different dinner tables tonight.  I don't know where this relationship is going, but it's going nowhere pretty fast.  and we're now seven years into this and  I don't know how to forgive this.  But if you know anything is it happened to me or my kids?  Is the world ever hears this till now?  He did something to us. His heart in his physical being to do that, but when he gets over, trade and essentially demonized I think he's capable of doing anything dangerous.  I'm scared.  I'm scared for what the future holds I'm scared for what a separation or a divorce would do.  I don't know how to talk to you about it. I obviously I mean I know I need counseling any counseling for so many things and this is a major one. He's refused take to get counseling the whole 7 years. He's refused to you know.  He's heard the gospel so many times and it's just like adults is off his chest. He's got a Heart of Stone.  So this is sad this is sad the day after Christmas that I'm having to deal with this.  I need to go deal with my four-year-old now he's screaming and crying.  Good night.

And I was kind of seeing someone but on the fence about it and I'm in a weird situation where I can't quite get out of it.  Let's see. Also, I'm stressed out because I'm moving back to New Mexico.  What's with that because it's not necessarily the safest place.

iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	because it didn't end perfectly but  it was real and I really enjoyed it and it made me think about you know, what I would need my kid, even though I know I am not trying to have kids. 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	He's from California actually.  Yea nice lived in Georgia. Just like me. 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	I'd rather be someone who could be myself. 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	I feel bad because I don't feel like I'm  I feel bad because I don't know what is going to happen.  with my life, and I don't know where I'm going to end up and I'm not  I don't have a hundred percent faith in my own abilities.  and I'm happy because I'm still willing to try and I'm still willing to  Do the work to get to where I want to be in life.  Despite the fact that that scares the shit out of me. 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	Try really hard not to hurt people.  Even though I end up doing it sometime still unintentionally. 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	I mean to me the only way that you can accurately judge someone's Behavior.  Isn't necessarily judging their behavior, but judging how it makes you feel and someone does something. I don't think you can necessarily.  Bought them for what they did. I think you can however fault them for.  You know them doing something and it and how it affects you and how they respond to the way that they're interacting with people. 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	I don't think I've ever been anyone has never hurt me. I mean  I know. 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	I wanted to live a life where?  I don't even know.  I'm tired of life. I wanted.  was  still not something that was going to make me happy.  I want it.  To be able to just suck it up and take whatever came my way and make it seem like it was fine.  But  now I want the kind of life where  I'm honest.  About being unhappy. I'm honest about being happy. I'm honest about needing to be loved and honest about needing to be alone. And I'm honest about how people affect me.  And even more importantly I'm honest about when people don't affect me when I don't care about them when they are necessary and they aren't conducive to my happiness side.  I just want to live a life where I can choose to be happy in every situation and that's not something that I can honestly say I want it before. 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	I don't think so. I don't know. 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	I think that this is a good start using this app. This is a cool thing cuz I can say things out loud and really hear them.  But I think me.  taking the time to appreciate those small victories in  Me take your time to do my own private Worship in.  doing things that  I really more me than anyone else.  I think  all those things would help me to not be so hard on myself into just whenever I start to get super.  Mean to myself I can.  just stop and  try to think of one thing that I'm proud of that I've done. 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	Okay.  I see myself as  best Survivor as  someone who keeps pushing  in trying I see myself as  someone who's persistent  someone who?  Love's hard and is  contemplatively and  constantly seeking I see myself is.  someone who's trying  it's really hard to do this and be positive.  I just think that I see myself as someone who  refuses  to let failure  be the final word.  Not even that I see myself as someone who  wants  more than anything  to make someone proud  I want to be proud of myself I want.  My family would be proud of me. I want.  other people just see what I'm doing what I've done and who I am and think damn she did that and just to be proud of me and have  you know what in all of my works just kind of  to be impressive  I just see someone who's trying to get there.  Despite all my other flaws. I think I see someone who  wants to be great. 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	Tell her I just don't know why I'm here.  I don't know what to do anymore, and I don't have  anyone to talk to  and I never have  Let's very lonely.  Baby, it sucks.  I want there to be an Intuit. 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	I think I'm the type of friend that chooses to be supportive and that chooses to allow people to find their own line life and find their own.  Feelings about things that happened to them and not impress my own ideas of what life is.  I want to someone else just telling them that I want the best for them. 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	I tried to  sleep watch TV.  Be around people.  Tried to distract myself. I've tried drinking of try taking the medicine that I'm supposed to take that kind of kill. My anxiety attacks have  try to bury myself in other things and emotions.  None of it really works exactly the way that I want to. 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	What are two positive self-talk myself but didn't really work out there. Well, because  there's always feel like I'm being honest with myself and sometimes me having that positive self-talk conversations Appeals. 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	I thought about  I mean, it's not a new idea but  about  being able to  C2 country the way I wanted to land.  Still achieve a goal. 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	it was a really good to just  to just  one or two cuts, you know not deep just enough to feel it and  skylights or this  anxiety girl  I don't even think I can do that. 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	play sad and  I don't know.  Why I'm even still here.  Hit cervix feels really pointless. 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	I don't know what I would tell myself. I think I just need to.  have more faith in myself and trust that I'm going to work hard and trust that I  concannon  be as impressive and driven as I always am and you know, I don't feel like that version of myself also know that there's no version of me that can.  settle for  Whatever. This is especially knowing now.  Knowing that now more clear than I've ever noted in my life, even though I've had this idea.  Now I know that I don't.  have anyone that I can trust my feelings or my fears or  anything about myself with  being okay with that just me.  coming back. So cool in before I get so stressed and so scared and have so much anxiety built up that I know that  I  I have me and I've survived so much already. I just need to have a bit of  Confidence in the universe in my inner goddess and guidance to Spirit and energy that lives.  It is real my just have to have  some sort of faith  You know.  I just need to be able to maintain that and that'll help.  Whenever I'm freaked out the way that I am right now. 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	I honestly have no idea what other people think about me people probably think I'm  irresponsible and  dumb and  You rude and selfish.  I don't know. I have no idea what other people think about me. I spend way too much time in my own head to know. 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	I don't know. I would like to just  pick  a lot of pills and drink a lot of alcohol in it.  Samaras in the bathtub of a hotel  That would be great. And then I could just be done with all of this.  I really don't even know why I'm still trying after everything. I don't.  Now what the fuck I'm doing and I would like to just be done with it all.  death would be  welcome to my shirt is  acting crazy is in those dudes with a shot me and then I'll be dead and then I wouldn't even have to be doing any of this. 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	supposed to be starting something new pretty soon and it just makes me really nervous and  I just  always know what I'm going to do and what I want to happen with it and what the steps I want to take a nap. Just don't know.  right now, I just don't know at all and I feel  scared and even more alone cuz I can't talk to anybody about it. 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	Maybe by a day.  you know, I had a bit of a break on it when I just was able to fully distract myself, but  probably about a full 24 hours and it's it's still there. 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	I hit my quotas at work today. And that was good. I like completing even small tasks. They make me feel good.  and  I was in good spirits all day long and I think that's a really good milestone for me. 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	The last time I helped someone.  I think the last time that I have actually helped someone in a meaningful way was when I was  honest with my coworker  I told her.  How much more she deserves in her life?  How much more she didn't deserve?  and that she  should choose what's best for her no matter what the situation. 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	I think I've been constantly in a state of panic for the last.  Good good.  year 2  and just so many things have happened that just kept pushing it and pushing it.  and  my sadness is at least subsided and some way but the fear.  and my anxiety and my  this constant constant and consistent worrying is having really going anywhere and I'm just trying to  have control over things that I can control.  but even that is a very daunting task for me, and it feels  little impossible 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	but I kind of feel like  a mixture of emotions I feel  Lucky that I have.  The boyfriend that I have and that I'm in this place in my life where I can really feel.  Like I can go.  they need directions from here but because today  I was so angry and hurt and  just  really the best version of myself and  me to just have these.  Sorry diesel.  Petty feelings is feelings in  inadequacies low self-esteem meaning  unworthiness  I'm desperate to all be it for something that's  You cooked up in my mind and I can at least admit that yes. I did kind of hurt my own Feelings by  jumping the gun and how I felt you jumping the gun and what was actually going on I mean  I'm not going to invalidate my own feelings, but  at the same time weather  I'm right about if he  love me or not. I know that I do love him and I don't want anything to happen to him.  That was so mad because  I just felt like  Just like that feel that everyone else that I would.  second third fourth Fiddle in his world and he's  I should be character mine.  It hurt me made me feel bad. And so when he reached out to me, I kind of  treat him the same way because I asked how I would come to feel and want him to feel how he made me feel and  Can I taken away from?  My mantra for the year and my goals for the year that I don't want to.  just  some people same feelings for someone else just because that's how they're making me feel. I don't want to make me feel bad. So I have to make them feel better.  What do I have to do with not at don't want to be that person? I don't want that for me. I don't feel good about it. And then  For me to do that to him.  Knowing how bad it made me feel.  I want to find out that he really didn't need me.  I just pay me so bad.  are there still work to do for me and I just  Regret that and I want her to feel better. I wasn't to be better and wanted me to just be okay.  I really do love him.  I think it's  this very loving and  pick up she'll pack he's very loving and  smart and kind and  I just kind of  amazes me is kind of  where to see someone be Who he is?  and if he does his reflection of him in the things that I do is a reflection of me and today mean  trying to make him feel bad.  Trying to make him feel hurt. Like I was hurting trying to make him feel.  can I quit how I was feeling and how to put it just  it's just  it's not who I want to be.  wrong in my opinion  it doesn't help anything in that just  I just want to work on that.  I really want with it. Okay, if  are more selfishly I just  I want to hold you down and take care of him and just make him feel better because  I just want to be okay. I just want to love you, man.  Give him whatever he needs.  guys having one away but  I don't think that.  Does that should have said my reaction?  now I feel like I mean, it's fine because like  Liars bump  Drake how I  Communicate to him how I'm feeling, but I know that all the other way probably Otherworld ways. It's just that I'm going to have to  tell myself that I'm not  a person  Hurt people I don't.  Push him away. I don't get him into a corner and don't.  change  How I am I don't put myself in a corner. I don't silence myself. I don't become a centerpiece.  till the life of a I just  dismissive  Carolina DMV and  He is.  Play me some Ashley.  bush hogging  my hands face  girls hairstyles  Jenna really know what else to say or do language.  in my mind was playing on right now is  and I can't stop pooping.  ugly shirt  available to her  how Bill 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	I'm thinking about.  my boyfriend and  If and what kind of future we even have.  super into him and  I don't want to end up being very stupid. I'm also thinking about  school in my future and if I can get an apartment or if I should get a car and just what the fuck I should do now.  I have a lot of thoughts about everything. 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	Yeah.  I feel like there been so many times where I've done something. That was great. And because other people weren't praising me I couldn't praise myself.  If I didn't feel like I had accomplished anything yet.  And I think that I can do that more I can say, you know what you did this thing and it wasn't easy and I'm proud of me.  And I don't need someone else's stamp of approval to be proud of myself as much as I used to. 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	just feels like my heart is beating really hard and fast in my chest and  so, I said  end  nervous 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	Today was easy and nothing made me feel.  anxious or sad 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	sometimes  sometimes I worry about what other people think of me.  In the same breath. I know it doesn't matter because  Who cares what other people think of me?  It's not adding or subtracting anything from my life to be honest. 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	I believe that.  I'm not the one who.  It's Old Testament Lee in control of where I end up. I know that I can.  Work hard and experience successes. I know that I couldn't work hard at it be for nothing. I know that I can do nothing and then it's still result in success. So I just have a very strong belief in.  Divine intervention in fate and the universe and God. I really think that  the more I try to plan my life in the more that I try to put all my ducks in a row the more I realize that I'm  not the one in control. It's just up to me to  put in the work somewhere for to show.  Somewhere else and just see what happens. 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	wow, I used to care so much about  being impressive to myself and to others and just being the super impressive person who just did all these cool things.  And I had no real formula for that and I still don't it just I don't care as much anymore.  about being impressive to people  I think at this point I realized that the most impressive thing that I could be.  is happy cuz  so few people actually are  And I think that that's what matters to me more than.  how others perceive what I'm doing 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	I want to have another.  spiritual session  on my makeshift altering.  really bring myself back down into my inner goddess in my  connection  with everything  I really miss my altar. So I really enjoy.  connecting myself in sitting with  myself. It's a great practice for me personally. 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	because I know that I have to  deal with my sadness and my fears and all of that by myself and  If I'm surrounded by people who?  hold on quotes love me just  I know I can't.  depend on anybody else to really  help to really offer anything that's going to make it feel.  better is going to make me feel less like I  Have a ruined my life, which I know most of that. Is it my fault and be that?  I have no idea where to go from here or what to do next at all.  I know they can't help me with that either. It's just dumb.  alone  in a lot of ways 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	It was pretty easy.  you know I had to think about it a little bit but it was pretty easy and I think it was just because I  I'm very interested in it. I think about myself and my choices and my past and what I want so much.  It's going those things that I kind of love and also don't like about myself that I think about things too hard.  but  it was good to say those things out loud. 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	I'm just I don't know why I'm lacking confidence is just me doing something new and something.  from scratching  I think I'm just still feeling the defeat from my last.  failure, basically 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	I couldn't live without.  Solitude and introspection  I don't think I'd be able to function properly if I was.  never  alone sometimes 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	I prefer.  evenings more not too late, but  the afternoon number for evenings more because  I feel more balanced in the evening that I do in the morning. 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	kind of a hard question  relaxing  maybe not relaxing. It makes me a little anxious something that brings me joy almost everyday.  Talking to someone that loves me. 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	I have no idea.  Actually don't know what other people think about me.  I mean, I know that.  I feel the sometimes people think that I'm not very smart. I know that sometimes people feel like I'm  mirror  cold even butt  I know that's just my idea. Honestly have no idea at all what people think about me. 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	Yeah, I think it would.  I think if  I was blessed afraid of failure are less afraid of.  being in a worse position than  I would take one anyting fearlessly.  I got to have mejor. 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	I would say that we're silly and  honest and unique  and trusting  of each other  I would say that we  see to understand each other.  And that way neither of us.  like the idea of lying or pretending  and that we both want to be very real in our relationship. 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	I have no idea.  I don't know. He says that he  Knew that he wanted me when he saw me, but I don't I don't know.  That's why something I think I'll believe from any man. Not again. I don't I don't know. I have no idea. I don't know. 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	we like to drink and  snuggle and watch TV together we like  eating random Foods together we like  laughing and joking and  just enjoying our own little world together. 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	He has things that he says that are funny to me that I kind of Steel and just because I think they're really funny. 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	I wish.  Change didn't scare me.  I wish failure didn't scare me.  I wish.  that  peeing  vulnerable didn't scare me.  Yeah.  That's what I got. I wish that change and  failure and being vulnerable weren't as scary to me and I wish that I would embrace them is just  a part of life 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	yeah, I do not feel like  I can't really be myself or say what I want to say and  I'll just keep everything to myself if I don't feel like that person truly.  Love me the way that I want to be loved. 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	I don't know what other people think about me.  It really doesn't even matter. 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	stop caring what I realize that it's  was holding me back from being  the most honest version of myself  and it was holding me back from  being happy and  it was picking me miserable.  And so I just decided that I don't care about that anymore. 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	man, I mean  I think I do Embrace failure, but it doesn't stop me from fearing it as much as I do and I think I would have taken some bigger swings and I've already taken some pretty big swings, but I think I would have  taking some bigger swings if I wasn't afraid and I think that  I would  Probably be happier if I wasn't afraid of.  Not being impressive and being the best. 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	Yeah, there are some mornings when I wake up and I feel really good or after I wake up. I  you don't have some.  confidence about the day and it myself 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	Because he has very little preference on what he eats. He's he could eat anything and I like to be adventurous and  I love the hell do those things with me. 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	because if you don't  try to be the best thing you never will be in even if you try to be the best.  at least you're learning at least you're trying at least you're putting forth effort, and I think that  Effort sometimes is more important than success. 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	she should not choose something that makes her unhappy or unsafe or  it makes her feel anything less then fucking royalty. 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	I will be able to function well with someone who didn't make me feel.  Judged or like I couldn't tell them any and everything.  about how I feel  what I wanted and what I don't want. 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	The best part of my day was watching baby driver. It was actually a really good movie.  And I enjoyed it. 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	Are you feeling proud that?  I  I'm trying to make a change and I'm really proud of myself for not.  Truck that guy can't lie.  I'm not very yet to feel proud about.  being here, but  I'm proud that even though I am here that  I am  speaking to put my best foot forward and that I'm seeking to  look towards the future and  not  at the best value is that is that lady before me the fact that I'm seeking happiness and stability and I'm proud of that. Mm.  I'm glad it I have at least that much left in meeting to try. 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	We talk about our feelings time then.  The ways that people have hurt us in the past. 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	What I don't know that's weird. 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	I wish I could but no I can't just talk to people.  nobody  seems to be able to understand how I really feel. 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	depressed and lonely and  isolated  unwanted  wrong in every way pretty much. 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	I finally feel like  I feel safe and  care for in a way that I didn't know that I need it. 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	p  talk to me and  he's Goofy with me and  I feel safe.  and I feel like  I don't have to be on guard with him 24/7 the way I am with every other man that I know. 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	He talks so much shit. He says.  the goofiest craziest things in  I don't.  think he's a liar when I ask him things he at least in my opinion tells me the truth, and I hope I'm not  Being dumb about that, but it feels very genuine.  He just doesn't make me scared. 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	yes, because  I like to feel like I matter to someone. 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	I'm laying in my bed trying to fall asleep. 
iHFla1kBasQBhwviOYwFnXdDhdB3	I was at home and  I was kind of just  thinking about my future and  I don't really have much control over it. 
iHaIwkuYQzWos230iLV7ycm7WSJ2	I had a mental breakdown today. I feel like my life is not getting anywhere.  I don't know. 
iIB4fRuJl7PhpWOSrDak5tltWCJ3	time with my family  and my husband 
iIB4fRuJl7PhpWOSrDak5tltWCJ3	family time and a nap and relaxing 
iIeyOcWMMGMPi3gSMkJPrLqD3XI2	Keto diet with me. Really excited to see him get back to being the person he can be. I really love him and want to see him happy.
iIeyOcWMMGMPi3gSMkJPrLqD3XI2	He needs to talk to me and have a conversation rather than just not speaking walking away. Annoys diverting every situation because he doesn't feel like discussing it and resolving it. 
iIeyOcWMMGMPi3gSMkJPrLqD3XI2	I can having a normal conversation with him without getting pissed off, but he needs to also listen and be constructive and try and make changes in his friends hit on his side too. It's very frustrating that I'm trying to grow and be more productive as a person and he seems to not be getting anywhere. 
iIeyOcWMMGMPi3gSMkJPrLqD3XI2	To keep positive and optimistic outlook on becoming a parent and  in life
iIeyOcWMMGMPi3gSMkJPrLqD3XI2	Nice, fun loving guy who cares deeply about everyone.
iIeyOcWMMGMPi3gSMkJPrLqD3XI2	I am starting the keto diet with Sean today. Beginning of Feb and time to get in shape for summer when we have Leukus.
iIeyOcWMMGMPi3gSMkJPrLqD3XI2	I know it is impossible to tune out negative.
iIeyOcWMMGMPi3gSMkJPrLqD3XI2	Getting Leukus and beginning the next stage of our lives 
iIeyOcWMMGMPi3gSMkJPrLqD3XI2	Having the opportunity to perform in play this weekend. It’s so much fun and Inlive the audience being engaged with the show when going well.
iIeyOcWMMGMPi3gSMkJPrLqD3XI2	Tax return not what we expected
iIeyOcWMMGMPi3gSMkJPrLqD3XI2	I need motivation and support to finally reach my goals.
iIeyOcWMMGMPi3gSMkJPrLqD3XI2	I'm really frustrated at Sean.  He always says that.  He always says he's telling something and never gets anything done. He never remembers anything and this is over and over and over and over again.  So he gets pissed off when I'm frustrated about it, but then I turn around and try and be nice to him and then he sits there and says why I'm just waiting for you to pitch about someone. You know, what if that's how you want. Then that's what you're going to get. It gets very frustrating. 
iIeyOcWMMGMPi3gSMkJPrLqD3XI2	Great morning! I feel refreshed and awake. Perfect morning start for a Monday.
iIeyOcWMMGMPi3gSMkJPrLqD3XI2	I will treat my body with the love it deserves.
iIeyOcWMMGMPi3gSMkJPrLqD3XI2	"To become disciplined in getting fit and getting the body I have always wanted physically.

To be come a confident person both inside and out."
iIeyOcWMMGMPi3gSMkJPrLqD3XI2	I probably should discuss with him about how I feel rather than just exploding. I'm hoping that maybe if I have a productive conversation that he might listen. 
iIeyOcWMMGMPi3gSMkJPrLqD3XI2	I hung out Runnin by we were talking on the phone. 
iIeyOcWMMGMPi3gSMkJPrLqD3XI2	Finding out we are matched with Leukus!

iQ3CAZiNNcV94jU7jq9p1KQt0Oo1	Don’t know all of it won’t there’s a lot. There’s rumors going on my work. And I fear these rumors are affecting my relationship with a dear friend of mine. Don’t even avocado colors friends. one point we were best friends, but Like you said, it’s in the past caught up in the past Cannery. It’s rough. I hate the word temporary. it’s just I don’t know, you know, some people might say that they would prefer to live experience then to not live it and not no knowledge about it. I don’t know if I feel that way about this friendship. compressed spine don’t know my feelings about if you want to talk to myself the more I say that it’s you know, it’s just just a friendship, but I’ve never cared about a bunch of those I do is this one so Maybe my motives are those that I see them to be. But like my astrological sign says 18 to fix things that are broken. How do I can’t decide if it was broken for renewing my broken after right now? That’s all that’s been occupying my mind this morning at end. Yeah, I’m pretty much what am I going to do to solve it? hustle work a lot about You know myself. hand trying to make myself a better person daily. I’m hoping the app will help with my mental health, which is kind of in the mouth sore. I can’t control it. I wish I could I wish I can just control my mental health and tell myself. I have to be happy. Swiss chard really is hard. I talked to my niece and sometimes I can’t figure out what she saying is a lie or the truth because she saw something on it and I’m slowly beginning to think that she’s rubbing off on me because I can stop flies coming from my mouth. Become second nature to me, which is kind of bad. Kind of don’t need that. Do you know? What are you going to do about it? You know. Five Forks, really really really really interesting way. Sometimes you’re on your highs. And that is your nose, you know before 2020 when started I felt like this was going to be my year. I’m going to end all my friendships. I’m going to be in a great mind space, but I’m not not at all. If anything. I feel like I’m going backwards because I still feel like shit. I feel like my life has become. meaningless and I have no purpose. I wish we can just sit down and talk about it. And if you’re wondering who he is. Can’t think about anything else but him is kind of stupid and counteractive but but you can’t locate what can you do about it? Can you please tell me so I can get over this but I really do want to want to get over this stupid person. That doesn’t give two fux about me. But I give all the fuck. I just I really want my life to just pause but it’s at and just let me let me catch up cuz I’m way behind. It’s rough I really is. I had a lot of things on my mind today. Constant questions of college and working if I’m going to stay in the same place for forever. All of these questions. Not a lot of answers. I want to get back to painting so I think that’s soothing calming. It’s hard. My day keeps getting more and more repetitive with work home sleep or come sleep or come see me eat. then there’s also. Trying to lose weight is really really hard. It’s harder than I imagined. how to make brown gravy it’s kind of sad. I don’t exactly know why. Very kind of the bask in the glory that everyone’s feeling. Now your is gone by in another holiday going to spend alone by my lonesome because I couldn’t handle it. It’s hard. I don’t even know what else is going on my head there so many rapid fire. thoughts cleaning my room him the other him. my stupidity about him I’m confusing myself up this way. I just wish life or just take one teeny tiny Paws and I just ripped this paint greatness. This is what I get for being. All puppy cuz I’ll bring it up on this. Keep coming up because if not, it’s going to get pain everywhere. Would you look at that? Another thing to add to my fucked up life? Can’t keep playing with that. I don’t know if I should keep saying things or wait till tomorrow cuz they be tomorrow. I have lost more things to talk about because my work on new freestyle machine. Lettuce. I’ll say goodbye for now. Cuz that’s all I can think about and really should be going but you know, whatever.

iukvhBj6sJg2bpLHfhO0hA4eIxl2	well  I thought about  what kind of house I want to live in and  About getting rid of my car isn't getting another car.  What kind of car I want?  I thought about Billy.  Hemi  And us and I thought about my kids.  I thought about my dog and the cat.  And I thought about fear and how lately I am.

iukvhBj6sJg2bpLHfhO0hA4eIxl2	a good memory or a bad memory 
iukvhBj6sJg2bpLHfhO0hA4eIxl2	Going over to my daughter's house.  getting dope  Popeye's chicken sandwich  and 
iukvhBj6sJg2bpLHfhO0hA4eIxl2	well  after having someone translate it.  It meant that I was opening my subconscious.  and  being given the tools to change.  and  learning things and being happy with myself 
iukvhBj6sJg2bpLHfhO0hA4eIxl2	My mistakes do not defy me to help me grow. 
iukvhBj6sJg2bpLHfhO0hA4eIxl2	I don't know you tell me what if 
iukvhBj6sJg2bpLHfhO0hA4eIxl2	well  because it was like mostly good but my back hurts so it kind of sucks. 
iukvhBj6sJg2bpLHfhO0hA4eIxl2	Okay, well.  I slept all day. I woke up.  I'm still really tired. So I went back to sleep.  I woke up again.  And I was really tired so I went back to sleep.  And then I got ready and hurried up over to my friends.  celebration of life  it was weird cuz like there was some people there that I knew.  But I fell.  Can a bad for her because she was like a really good person.  She comes from really high class people.  and  like her little sister was talking about her like  When she was bad or something, I don't know.  But yeah, that was my day.  That was my day though. 
iukvhBj6sJg2bpLHfhO0hA4eIxl2	No, not really.  I'm sick. 
iukvhBj6sJg2bpLHfhO0hA4eIxl2	My relationship with Billy and relationship with my kids. 
iukvhBj6sJg2bpLHfhO0hA4eIxl2	Can you help me find out what the dream meant? 
iukvhBj6sJg2bpLHfhO0hA4eIxl2	Well, I have a lot of different things going on.  I'm happy that bill is getting out and I'm kind of scared. I'm just scared. I don't want to mess up again.  Because I love him and I don't want to hurt me.  I  have a lot of responsibility sometimes and I just kind of feel really loan with it. But at the same time I'm grateful that I have all of it.  I miss my friend Sherry really bad still.  I feel so alone sometimes so fucking loan.  I've got to find a home a different place to live.  except cats dogs and people with records  my kids and my ex is starting to be pissy.  Cuz he has a new fucking girlfriend, you know, if I came with that shit.  You know he can get mad like but he was jealous.  I was with him like he can't get mad about Billy not want me to hang out with him besides that I was still helping him out with money. I don't know why he's being a fucking dick damn fucking late. That's the worst thing about me. I think we're good.  I just I have a lot.  And a lot of good things to have a lot of good things like I'm not saying bad.  Cuz I'm glad he's coming home. I fucking miss him. I hate feeling alone. I need him.  He's my partner.  But I also need things from him and I hope that he's willing to do what I need.  I prefer not to Stanley stop.  But I need him to.  There's things that I need him.  To be willing to change about himself into for me. Cuz sometimes I really do feel like our whole relationships about him and his feelings even though he's like love on me and courting me and doing all these kind things.  I'm not asking them of him and he asks a lot of me and  I just I want us to have more equal relationship. Like he fucking went and told us she didn't like he's done a lot of rush it to me and like he wants to clear that to the side like it doesn't matter cuz he's going to take care of it, but  it's not about that. It's  I don't know. I don't know. 
iukvhBj6sJg2bpLHfhO0hA4eIxl2	Well, I really didn't do too much.  I went and paid for my car so I can go pick that up.  My daughter came and visited and  how do you go down at home? 
iukvhBj6sJg2bpLHfhO0hA4eIxl2	It was in a basement.  but the thing is I looked up and  It was like the castle on top he got moved to the side.  So the basement was wide open. 
iukvhBj6sJg2bpLHfhO0hA4eIxl2	Billy  is going to get to come home on Thursday.  And that's an amazing chance. I'm grateful for that.  Grateful, I have a home.  I'm great for my kids love me.  I'm just grateful in general. 
iukvhBj6sJg2bpLHfhO0hA4eIxl2	Yeah, actually.  I had those.  mini Smokey links in BBQ sauce  And I made bacon wrapped chicken tenderloins with honey, and they were pretty good. 
iukvhBj6sJg2bpLHfhO0hA4eIxl2	my dog  not having a Troublesome family.  You touch with the people in my life. 
iukvhBj6sJg2bpLHfhO0hA4eIxl2	well  I've got this drive home. I got to get laundry done today.  Go out to eat with my kids.  and run a few errands 
iukvhBj6sJg2bpLHfhO0hA4eIxl2	I guess I would try to enjoy it. 
iukvhBj6sJg2bpLHfhO0hA4eIxl2	I would do everything.  Whatever I wanted.  At night if it was only me.  And I could be up at night when everybody was asleep.  I would get.  things like laundry done  house clean  writing  painting 
iukvhBj6sJg2bpLHfhO0hA4eIxl2	Okay, I would have handled my mom's husband molesting me different. 
iukvhBj6sJg2bpLHfhO0hA4eIxl2	I will make healthy decisions for my body today because I am with 
iukvhBj6sJg2bpLHfhO0hA4eIxl2	I'm beautiful in each and every way. 
iukvhBj6sJg2bpLHfhO0hA4eIxl2	Well, it's actually been pretty cap pretty crappy today.  Remy I feel like I just got manipulated and I don't even know how I got manipulated when I think I'm usually pretty smart, but I'm just thinking about this whole situation and Billy in jail and all the shit. He left out here for me to handle.  And I'm reassuring him when the reality I shouldn't even be reassuring him. And I totally feel like I just got manipulated. 
iukvhBj6sJg2bpLHfhO0hA4eIxl2	Be kind to others and help others in need.  can back 
iukvhBj6sJg2bpLHfhO0hA4eIxl2	Well that depends on the day.  Sometimes I just get exasperated.  but I also know some of that is me being selfish and  this is new territory.  He makes me feel loved and it makes me feel protected.  He makes me feel cared for.  But I also get scared. 
iukvhBj6sJg2bpLHfhO0hA4eIxl2	my relationship  challenges me because sometimes I don't know if I'm wrong or right.  I don't know if it's my trauma talking.  Or if it's my inner voice.  But at the same time I love him and I know that he loves me and I see him working to change for me.  So it makes me want to be good to him.  And I also know his intentions are good.  And I know that he really does love me cuz I watch him back down on things that I don't think you would have back down with anybody else.  and  my my kids  that's always challenging not in a bad way.  It sounded me to just be better and  I'm so grateful for that. 
iukvhBj6sJg2bpLHfhO0hA4eIxl2	Okay.  I was his assistant.  And taking care of this man. He was older than me.  He was handsome.  He was in a wheelchair.  But he could walk.  But I just pushed him around sometimes. I don't know.  He had a golf cart.  I would drive him around the golf course.  And drive him around the yard of the house.  And we driving the house too sometimes.  The house is very nice.  The kitchen was very modern.  The living room was very neat.  I saw couch and table.  Thor nick-nacks and magazines maybe on the table in the living room and lamps  And the bedroom the bed.  And I have sex with him.  And I drove him.  to the movies  and we came back and had sex and I could feel it. 
iukvhBj6sJg2bpLHfhO0hA4eIxl2	everything  specifically probably not whine like I am right now.  Andy Mohr grateful cuz I do a lot of grateful for

j3FsOO0ui5M5WKTpMf4zHtOTsql1	The day just started. So I'm feeling okay right now. 
j4VQOUFlcaVGOdGrizp3BVQZAbh1	I have a job.  I just don't like my job. 
j4VQOUFlcaVGOdGrizp3BVQZAbh1	I realized introducing myself right now to be honest. 
j4VQOUFlcaVGOdGrizp3BVQZAbh1	It's fine. It's fine. What are you going to wear?  Are you know what?  Will having a warrant tour already. I don't know.  Okay. Well, it's only 50°. I don't need to wear a heavy jacket good.  What else?  Okay with this.  Don't worry be sir.  the actual photo Laura sweater  jacket  tell me where to get coverage start.  What hurts really bad?  Okay. 
j4VQOUFlcaVGOdGrizp3BVQZAbh1	I really value self-reflection and internal growth. 
j4VQOUFlcaVGOdGrizp3BVQZAbh1	Well, it's not that I'm having with a great day so far. It's just that I'm having a really reflective morning.  And I like when I wake up in the mood to like I wake up with enough time to get my health together and think through things. I feel like I haven't really been able to do that lately. So  I'm just happy that I can do that now.  I just feel like I'm  Often in conflict because you know, it's not like I'm looking forward to going towards because not something I look forward to doing everyday. It's just something that I know that I have to do cuz I don't really have any other choice I refuse to be unemployed.  and  I think that the ends to justify the means.  but  but my job frustrates me a lot sometimes cuz it makes me feel like you know, I'm going there for no reason like make me feel like I'm wasting my time.  You're not putting a lot of effort and everything that I do and I'm not releasing the results that I would like.  and that you and constantly getting constantly experiencing that is  really discouraging  cuz not like the pay is there took this job for  new to pursue my passion shit. I told myself that after you didn't even have my was going to put myself in the situation. That made me so happy again in island of doing that.  So, I don't know. My kind of woman outside looking in just in cold, you know, she's just very stressed out like, you know, there's nothing really wrong with your job. She's just stressed in like  That's not it. I know myself way too well to  know that it's not just  The money that's the problem. It's the rolling itself, and I know that  so  maybe it's time to just like  and I know that so  but I also know that I would be  but I'm in a lot better replace here living on my own then I would be if I move back home with my parents.  This is just confusing.  Guy gets Clarity will come with time. 
j4VQOUFlcaVGOdGrizp3BVQZAbh1	I can sleep in.  And I don't have to be bothered by people that don't want to deal with. Is childish I know.  but having to  good myself a pep talk everyday that you're myself going and is not ideal. 
j4VQOUFlcaVGOdGrizp3BVQZAbh1	I like a lot of like self-reflection and reflection on my my day / daily planning.  So anything that forces me to reflect on the way things are currently anything that forces me to plan.  I collect short-term planning. So planning on my day or planning out my week for us is planning out for like the general future.

j5BnKDBuyNhejDqYrQS0LBdu65b2	A friend referred me to you. 
j8Q4vfy07gejWCLdgce0RVQ1kL62	I'm excited my second or my first official day is tomorrow. 
j8Q4vfy07gejWCLdgce0RVQ1kL62	Does pretty uneventful?  Laid in bed. I was very anxious today. 
j8Q4vfy07gejWCLdgce0RVQ1kL62	I have severe depression and anxiety. I love my cat and I just got a new job. 
j8Q4vfy07gejWCLdgce0RVQ1kL62	I guess I'm a little hopeful that this job will work out and then I'll be happy with it. 
j8Q4vfy07gejWCLdgce0RVQ1kL62	Basically, I was just really really really anxious today for no reason. I think I'm a little nervous for  work tomorrow. I just want to be good and I know it takes time and everyone's really supported there. But I just don't I don't want to mess up and I know it's just a learning curve and had to tell myself like you can do all this. No one is judging you or thinking you're doing a bad job, but I'm still just  nervous when it's a new experience and they've never done. 
j8Q4vfy07gejWCLdgce0RVQ1kL62	The customer service aspect of the job kind of just not having the pressure of having to find a nine-to-five that I know wouldn't please me. 
j9LgmLbqnvfgIXeWFmZY03M8QXu1	My friends and family and my boyfriend 
j9LgmLbqnvfgIXeWFmZY03M8QXu1	Got up and did my morning routine
j9LgmLbqnvfgIXeWFmZY03M8QXu1	My shit that comes out of my ass
j9LgmLbqnvfgIXeWFmZY03M8QXu1	My boyfriend because he always makes me happy
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	Again, like Ireland or something or Garner? 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	Today and I don't get to take naps often because I work so much. So when I sleep I sleep and that's all I get but I did get to take a nap today cuz it's my first day on break and I came home and I went to sleep. 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	Mentally or physically mentally I would just like to be I don't know.  obviously happy but again, I think a lot of my  like personality and who I am comes from like my mental.  Health and that it's not always the best and so I don't think I would want to completely change that out think I want to get rid of it. But I know it's really hard especially when I have weeks that I am depressed or sad or unmotivated and things like that.  so  I guess I just want to be more stable I guess.  And happy more often. Not that I'm not happy a lot. I don't know. I guess more or mentally stable. Physically. I'd like to be in Austin.  I love being home and I love my family, but it stresses me out a lot and it that's a lot of pressure to.  Be a certain person or a certain way or the BOK and I don't know. So yeah, I'd like to be in my own place in Austin where I feel accepted and free. 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	Nobody there was nobody else on the couch at all. It was just me and him. 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	Again, I don't really understand but I guess I can try and like get this one.  The first person that was with me during like a breakdown that I've had being completely sober is Autumn and I had my parents for sure, but then Autumn I had a panic attack over.  Bike the scary songs that were on the radio that were very low and it sounded like demonic noises and I guess that's another thing I'm scared of. I'm very very scared of demons, even though I'm not religious and I don't believe in God necessarily, but for some reason I'm very scared that because I'm not religious if it is real I'll be in hell and demons and hell and all that scare me. 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	Yeah, he was curled up on the corner like pushed as far as he could to left hand side.  And it was so cute that you just curled up and he had he's a big dog. So he had both of his front feet hanging off of the couch and then his whole head hanging off the couch. And is that business trooping there? 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	It was on the highway on the way home from Dallas. And again, I think either drugs or alcohol will have a lot of reason for a lot of my mental problem because it was after I drank a lot and got alcohol poisoning and blacked out and was very sick, and I was driving home from Dallas Dallas, San Marcos.  and  yeah, it was on the road and I start having a panic attack and just started bawling and couldn't breathe and hyperventilating and I couldn't really drive the car anymore. So I had to slowly get off on to go to the gas station and just sit there and try to get my breathing under control so I could get back on the road. 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	What about your dream in it journals that through like speaking, but it also writes it and you can either read it back or like listen to it back and every time you poop. 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	I don't remember who was in my dream at the moment. It was a few nights ago.  But I remember that I was outside there was like not a cage but like a chicken coop kind of cage. It was very tall and there was a hedgehog in it. There was a man in the coop with the Hedgehog and there was hey all along the bottom like we're a convero underneath and it was like those dog parks where you have one door where you walk in.  And can close the door behind you and then another door where you can walk into where the animal is that way the animal cannot get out there still in some sort of closure.  And I remember that the person inside of the coop had the door open on the inside and  I had gone to open the door to come in and the Hedgehog race to me because I didn't the Hedgehog would be so quick.  The Hedgehog race to me and stuck. It snows through. I tried to close the door really fast and stuck. It snows through the door the metal door and the bar and was running as hard as it could trying to get through the door.  And finally it when it realized it was not going to be able to get out it stopped and it ran back into the hay and then I went into the actual. Hey part.  And close the door behind me and I know some weird things happened. I don't remember exactly what I think the floor started turning weird and was muddy and it started getting kind of scary and I wish I would have  Noted it before like when it had just happened, but the person in the coop was saying really weird things.  And then I left and I don't remember much after that. 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	I don't remember any of my friends or family again. This is an older dream. I'm going to try and start doing this right after they happen. But in this dream I was outside walking in the road.  I'm sorry. I'm getting ahead of myself. No, I do not remember any friends or family. 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	Autumns dad. My dad calling. 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	It could honestly be a look into the future I could see this happening.
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	I don't know if it was him trying to talk to me like he moved on.  His Spirit trying to talk to me or if it was just a way for me to process the guilt and sadness that I have for what I've gone through.  But I think it could be either one of those things. I don't know if I believe that dreams can you can talk to people that are passed on through dreams?  but if it is then I think that is what it was or it could just be my mind trying to  process 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	I don’t think I see a meaning currently. Maybe that I am a bit of a hypocrite because of my car. And that it’s hard for me to have sex but I like it. 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	Coming home to have a nap!! But now I cannot sleep..
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	Autumns dog Opie tries to run out a lot and we have to make sure he doesn't run away.  Am I had a dog? He never like to run away though. So I don't think it had anything to do with him.  I think that's it. 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	Yes, I think most. Most a lot of my strange dreams come from my experiences that I've had on drugs and I don't think that the dreams are showing the experience itself. But like I feel the way that I fell on drugs a lot and I know that is something that scares me in real life is when I take any type of medicine or even whenever I drink or put anything into my body, it scares me that I will not be able to have control like I did when I was using drugs. 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	Yes, the main two people I remember in it were my aunt and my cousin. 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	I tried to just stay away from her dad and laugh things off. When my dad called I just tried to stay in a positive mood.
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	Yes, opinions on fraternities, I do not agree with them because of the hazing 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	I woke up in a sweat feeling like it was real. I am scared to go back to sleep and it’s only 4:55. I slowly am feeling better but I keep looking behind me. It makes me feel better autumn is here so I know there is something real. 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	Laying in bed, I need to get up and exercise to get my dopamine levels up. 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	I Dreaming all colors. I don't ever dream in a specific color but colors that stood out I want to say is black dark brown like a dark greens from the forest the black and dark brown would be from the old house.  And the inside of the car was like a dark gray pretty much like the car that I have.  And it was night time. So everything was dark and definitely like the black on the road. So yeah. Those are the main colors. 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	"There was a blonde guy that came in to what was at first a kitchen then turned into a forest he said to me that he was going to kill me then turned the lights off. He kept saying if I have a knife he’ll spare me so I tried to give him mine but every time I tried it just showed him where I was and he wanted to kill me more. I threw the knife on the ground and just kept running all there was were circles. It stuck face up and he ended up getting his hand caught in it so I grabbed the one from him and just started slashing. Somebody grabbed me from behind and we were back in the kitchen. They were yelling at me to stop I was crazy. It was his mom. Everyone around me tried to convince me I was crazy and he wasn’t really going to kill me he was just playing with me and I didn’t trust anyone. Flora was the only person on my side but you could tell she didn’t believe he was going to kill me either just that he was not a good person and he knew he shouldn’t have been messing with me like that. She was trying to explain to his mom why it was not okay and she was not having it. Lissa was in my dream for a minute he texted him mom saying he wanted his brother and a friend and so we went to pick them up we couldn’t find them anywhere and I was getting scared of how he was going to react. 
We end up at my pawpaws house it is very muddy outside and I have no shoes on. The guy is there and I’m freaking out all I can think about is him trying to kill me and he’s out to get me. He told me to put on shoes and I was scared to make him mad so I went inside to try and find shoes. I couldn’t find any and my heart was spiking in heart rate he offered me to wear his and I refused because I thought he was just trying to get in my head. I asked him if he was trying to kill me and I’m my ear he whispered maybe and walked off. 
I was then in bed with a friend and she knew the guy too I asked her what she thought and she said she really believe that I BELIEVE that I was in danger for my life. She went up to go to the bathroom and I started having an anxiety attack because I knew he was close by and was going to try and get me again if she wasn’t there. Somebody started eating me out and I was trying to push them away and they wouldn’t and I was screaming and crying. She came back and they were gone she got in bed and tried to comfort me and when I rolled over to her I felt water balloons in the bed i asked why and she said so she could tell when I was having a bad dream because one would burst. Then I realized I have PTSD. I tried to go to sleep and she said I was saying awful things about her in my sleep and I tried to tell her it was because my PTSD makes it hard for me to trust anyone. 
The guy is back and we’re in a kitchen with 2 other people they’re doing a lot of sexual gestures towards me and I just want to leave. As I try to he turns the lights out again and sprints at me with a bucket. My friend turns the lights on and catches him doing it and yells at him to get away from me. Still they don’t believe he was going to hurt me just fucking with me but I can feel that he wanted to hurt me. I feel very vulnerable. We end up at some ritual his girlfriend is there and her name is Jerrika she hates kids and wants me to have my ovaries ripped out. I am running from everyone and some old man stops me and asks to shake my hand because he wants to be in the matrix too and I won’t. Then jerrika tries and I won’t. I tell them it’s not a matrix I have PTSD. I was scared. "
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	"Taking opie to the vet
Seeing my aunt 
Cleaning my room 
Cleaning out my car"
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	Okay, so and this dream I was in a car accident. I started off on a bike on a bicycle and I was going down a road.  And that road was like a Dark Knight Road that had like trees on all along the side and I remember not really being able to see the left side of me. But all along the right side was like Forrest and I think the road was either a dirt road or maybe just like an old Road not a newer Road.  and I remember being on the bicycle and as I was going by the trees there were like  People in the trees like walking through the trees and I started getting really scared by it because I didn't feel like it didn't feel safe.  And so as I was on the bicycle in the bicycle, they got really really tall and really really thin and then I was like this giant on this like really tall thin bicycle in the trees for like all small beside me and I kept going down the road and as I went the road turned into like a path and I went down that path in the further. I went down the path.  it was  like I started getting small again.  And I came up to this house and whenever I went into the house, I got off my bike. I wanted to the house again. They're still trees. All along both sides me I go into the house and I start to realize that this is not a good house like the people that own the house are very bad people.  And so but now they know I'm there and said they don't want me to leave and so they captured me and they put me into this room and I remember being on a bunk bed in the room and I'm on top of the bunk bed, and they're walking up and down the hallways that I remember the houses made of wood. It was very creaky Holes in the Floor holes kind of everywhere was not a secure house and you could  In the dream, I could hear down all the hallways and I could Envision every room like even though I didn't know the house as they were taking me and putting me into this room. I could Envision every room that was attached to the house.  And I remember thinking I had to get out and I'm sitting on top of this top bunk and I'm waiting for an opportunity to get out of the house.  The people that own the house that also reminded me of like  like hillbilly type  Hillbilly, like abusers like physical abusers. I think it was like maybe not parents but like a couple maybe that they wanted kids or had kids, but they already did abused.  And I'm laying on the top bunk and I'm hearing their voices down the hallway, and I'm scared to move, but I know that they want to kill me and I believe they want to end up eating me for dinner.  and so  it's the Dream It's kind of fuzzy again. I'm excited to use this whenever I remember the dream completely.  but  I'm over at somehow. I I learned that their daily routine or new their daily routine somehow and I knew that they were going to leave soon. They had to go somewhere or get something.  And as they were leaving I had to find a way out and as I was like running out.  They were trying to catch me and I don't remember this whole part, but I know there's a lot more to it, but somehow I got away and as I got away, I got back on my bike and I bite as fast as I could down the path like back onto the road that I was on in the first place. And as I got there my car slowly started turning or my bike slowly started turning into a car and I'm going as fast as I can and I'm going from a side road up onto like a main highway road. And then the car I had no control over I'm driving the car, but I feel like I'm about to fall asleep at the wheel but it doesn't feel like I'm tired. It feels more like again. I'm on for some sort of substance and I'm trying so hard to concentrate on the road, but I'm digging side to side.  and  I've dis is where the dream becomes Lucid. I don't think all of my lucid dreams are completely I think I have lucid parts to a lot of my dreams such as like I can hear things are completely read things or touch things like really feel them smell things and really smell them and it's completely real and it was whenever it turned into that car that the dream was completely real to me and I'm trying so hard to concentrate on to the road cuz all I can think is that I'm going to wreck and die and my parents are going to have to know that I died from  Drinking and driving even though I wasn't drinking but that's what they were going to think and I wouldn't have any way to explain to them that I didn't put anything into my system.  And so I'm trying to straighten up my driving on the road and I'm going left and right and left and right and again my I'm trying to concentrate on the road, but I can't hold that thought of concentration. And so I keep my head keeps dropping down.  And feeling very again like not there.  and then I remember I'm finally getting onto the highway and I just completely on the right side crash and wreck into the  the side, that's made of  not plaster concrete the side concrete column. I just completely wreck like so hard into and the car is falling apart around me and yet somehow getting smaller like closer into me at the same time and I remember sitting at the wheel and again, I'm like falling in and out of consciousness.  I'm trying to stay awake so hard because I'm a scared if I go out of Consciousness that I'm going to die and  So I end up I have my seat belt on my seatbelt just keeps tightening and tightening in the car doors are tightening around me and I hear the police coming in the police like pulling up and as the police are pulling up in a Guinness is part of the Lucid. This is like the seatbelt push pressing down on to me and the walls closing in on me felt. So real felt as if I really had something pressing down on my chest. Like I was losing my breath and the closing around me like felt like I was  if it was real life felt like I was having a panic attack, but I really felt the doors actually pushing up against my body and the seat belt pressing down into my chest and it just kept getting smaller like a clown car and the police came and I remember as the police were getting their I could hear them in the background talkin and talkin about what substances I was on and 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	I think we live in a much better world. I was just talking about that recently that I believe the world has more bad people than good people and I think there are a lot of good people but I think because of some cultures especially some underdeveloped cultures. There's a lot more bad than good that comes within.  And yeah, I think everybody has gotten good in them. Some people just are more bad several more good and I don't think anyone's completely 100% either one of those.  But if they were more kind I think people would be happier. I think there'd be less suicide. I think there'd be less war.  better mental health. All those good things 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	It was really a short dream. So there wasn't much to stand out. But I just remember him looking so real so vivid every I could see every single piece of hair on him.

jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	I was babysitting the girls who were so sweet and I knew the older one but it felt like the first time that I was meeting the baby. I didn’t know whose kids they were but this wasn’t the first time I was watching them. Annie Kae talked ALOT and told me how much she loved me and missed me and wished she got to see me more and would just go on and on and on about everything I needed to be caught up on. She had very high energy. I felt like we were waiting for their parents to come get them. And then a car pulled up, out of the car was JT. This was his kids. I was guessing he was no longer with the girl or I would not be babysitting them but we were also no together.
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	All I remember is that I was in the living room with him and I was standing up and he was on the couch. It wasn't a living room that I've ever been in.  And I don't necessarily remember that couch because a little bit of me thinks it was like an older couch. But then also I see it being like a normal one. I'm not sure. I remember the couch was facing me. I was on the right hand side like  off to the side  and he was on the left hand side of the couch and they're just laying down putting his head down and he looked really sad and I just remember kind of being able to like not hear his thoughts but feel his feelings and he was very disappointed with me and upset with me and sad with me.  And I remember like wanting to go consult him and like pet him and love on him.  But it's not like he moved away from me. He never moved. He laid just the way he was but because I could like Bree his emotions like through his mind.  I got this feeling of a didn't want me to consult him. If you didn't want me around him. He was very  like a ghast. I don't know if that's the right word to use but like wanted wanted space from me and didn't want me around.  And I just remember thinking that it has to be because I put him down and I feel really bad about that.  But  it was it was for his own good and Mild good like both he was very sick, and I don't know that he knew that cuz he was so happy.  And so I think it might be hard for him to understand why.  And how hard it was for me and not that it was about me because I know it was hard on him, but I think because he was still happy. It was hard for him to understand why I would do it if he was happy.  And I just want it to be there, but I knew that it wasn't my call I was his and so I just let him lay there.  Yeah. 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	We were having a party because my parents weren’t home. Shawna left the party drunk and sideswiped my car. I was furious and was screaming in the driveway at the top of my lungs. Somebody reminded me that I had wrecked someone’s car once and they weren’t mad at me but I was still mad and kept saying she’s going to pay for the door on my car. I went back in the house and there was a man in there that I don’t think I remember but somehow knew and did not want there. I told him my parents were coming home soon so he’d leave. He didn’t want to leave so I started picking things up. There was pizza I was picking up and Dr Pepper that I put into the freezer for some reason. I tried to make myself some food it was a hot pocket with a sausage inside that was folded like a pretzel pocket and I put it in the microwave. As I started to eat it I got worried that guy was still there so I started speaking to autumn saying I think my parents are coming home soon. Again he would not leave so I went outside in the driveway my sister Ashleigh was there and bradley Gibbs was there and we were talking about relationships as I was separating out some pencils that were wrapped up in a rubber band I don’t remember what the conversations consisted of much but Bradley started playing the guitar. I went back inside and my memaw was in there there was a sheet of paper that had a camping ground on it and around the camping ground was a bunch of labels of different animals it was in a plastic bag with a bunch of different colored jewels but they were pretty mixed up I started making the camping ground on the floor house on the right side animals around it in different sections however I was not worried about the jewels being separated so I was just dumping them on the floor. I started to feel really tired and I couldn’t respond much to others. My memaw was telling because I was not separating them right and I didn’t really care so I just dropped it and picked up the piece of power and started to read it. In my dream I could read everything completely clearly but I can not remember now what it said. There was also a list of rules for the camping ground and I wanted to post that up on a cabinet in the living room. My memaw was still yelling at me so I didn’t want to ask her for tape so I tried to peel off some tape from another piece of paper that was already there and use it but it wasn’t working. I finally got it and was so tired and empty feeling that I went and laid on the living room floor. When I laid there my memaw was gone and all the jewels were gone but Paloma was there. She was laying next to me telling me she missed me and I was pretty annoyed by her and trying to ignore her. She kept pushing it and started saying she wanted to have sex with me. Normally I always want to have sex but I didn’t want to with her so I kept ignoring her. She started getting frustrated so she said I want to see if you’re wearing any panties while I had spandex on and was digging into my spandex to see if she could feel them I told her I was wearing underwear and she could stop but it felt really good. We started making out and she was being very over sexual and I started to get into it. We started having sex and she started whispering to me asking why I always think of her as an angel when we have sex. I was trying to collect my thoughts but felt very muddled and started to try to say because it is comforting for me and she started petting my hair saying I know I know. The I woke up. 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	Difficulty breathing yes, no body pains or sweating. Fast heart rate. Tension in my neck and spine. 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	I always dream in color.  And I don't think there was any symbols.  No, there's no symbol that I could think of maybe just maggots. So I guess maggots would symbolize Decay rotting.  So maybe like rotting From the Inside Out not having good mental health not literally rotting but like in a metaphorical way. 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	tan  Brown  I don't remember what color the man was wearing. I'm thinking green, but I could be wrong. I mostly tan and brown is specially the grass from the outside and the hay 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	It’s my first day on Christmas break my first year teaching :)
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	I don't think of my lucid dreaming is having control over their dreams because a lot of times I still don't in it. I have my own thoughts my real thoughts and not like a dreaming thought of like watching something from an outside and just like watching it happen and like being scared but like having physical thoughts of  like real consciousness  So in my thoughts a lot of times I want to do something or want to make a change or want to make an action but I can't because most of my lucid dreams. I feel like I am on a substance where I cannot control myself and as much as I try and I try and get that concentration and control I can't but my lucid dreams consists more of that like real thoughts knowing sometimes knowing that I'm in a dream or sometimes it feeling just so real and then actual senses of taste touch hearing smell things like that. 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	I was in I think it was like either Garner or like Ireland or the like that but there is a lot of Hills and River and  Yeah, mostly like hills in River kind of area and at the very top of like this really long like Winding Road there was house on top of the hill.  And it took place in that house. 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	Not always.  I think I try and push myself actually.  I think sometimes I do push myself too hard. And after I push myself too hard, then I like it very very overwhelmed and I'm stressed out or I'm too hard on myself.  And then what I do that I try and like take a step back and realize like hey, it's not this big of a deal and try and like make light of it but then there's other things that no, I don't push myself hard enough on play. Sometimes I procrastinate and can be lazy especially with cleaning and like being organized and things like that but was actually like my job and getting things done in my mental health in relationships that I have. Yes. I think I pushed myself very hard. 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	There's a lot of things that I'm scared of. And again, I think there's a lot of things. I'm not I think  Like I'm scared of illnesses. I'm very scared that I'm going to die early. I'm not actually even scared of death, which is the weird thing because  yeah, I'm not scared of death. I'm just more scared that I'll die because of an illness or a sickness that is going to be painful or take a long time to get through or to cure or that I'm going to be miserable and sick.  because pain does suck and I'm a baby about pain but I like my biggest fear is getting like some sort of cancer or illness or  I don't know. Yeah, I have a lot of fear about illness.  I fear with medication pretty much all medication. I'm fearful of  What are the things I'm scared of doing new things? I hate that because I love to do new things and if it's something fun and creative I'm always open. But when it's something that's like life-changing. I'm usually very scared of it and I hate that because sometimes it prevents me from actually doing things that I would that I want to do.  and I'm very proud of myself for  accepting this job offer and doing this job that I have done this year because I turned out to be really good at it and I was scared. I was going to be awful cuz I've never been in the classroom.  And I've had a lot of positive praise and so it makes me less scared to do.  New things and then also with relationships. My biggest fear is to have someone leave me that I love.  And so a lot of times I will just like let things go or not bring things up. We're not like always accept my feelings or get upset or angry with anyone for things because I'm scared if we get into a fight they're going to leave and that's it. And that's something that I had gotten over a lot and with my last relationship I noticed and I hope I'm able to change into my next relationship and I feel like I can but I never know once I get there like how I'll be. 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	I feel greatful to know that I have wonderful people around me to help me grow and get better every day. 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	I was given another tarot deck. I am thankful for my family. I am thankful for my friends. 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	Yes, it was as soon as the bicycle turned into a car and I started.  Like nodding to In and Out Of Consciousness and the car it was a complete lucid dream at that point. 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	my dad  my brother  I still think I don't know. I think I could live without everything and that sounds awful, but  I used to think that I couldn't live without my dog and I was forced to or I had to I'll say.  and as much as it sucks life goes on and so I think you  whether you think you can or you can't we'll always  Just have to live without things and so as much as there are things that I don't want to live that. I think that I would just have to anyway, but thanks, but I would not want to live without would ya be my dad and my brother.  I think I think I saw that you're hot. 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	I really just say being there being open and trusting and open-minded and accepting.  Because I talk to my friends about everything and I don't expect any of my friends to keep my secrets. Like I know I'm at keeping secrets. So I think if I'm willing and open to tell somebody about it, it's not the biggest doll in the world to me if they feel the need to talk to someone else about it to get it off their chest too. Cuz that's a lot to put on somebody.  So yeah, that's not something I care about but mostly I just being accepting like I always want to feel like I can talk to my friends about anything and I can that's why I have two friends I do is because I can talk to them about everything and anything and they same thing with them to me. I'm all the times the one they'll call to just get things off their chest. 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	I think because I feel like I was rotting from inside out and I have a lot of dreams that are like maybe a lot of pus will come out of a pimple and it will not stop. It just keeps coming and coming or like that one bugs are coming out of my nose and was just coming out and coming out or sometimes my teeth will chip off and it won't stop and I it I almost make it worse because I like can't stop doing it. Whatever the action is. Whatever I'm doing that's making it come out. I just keep doing it and doing it and doing it until there is either a giant hole left in my Facebook from squeezing out the pus or like the snot just kept going or like my teeth until they're just grinded down to nothing. and  again, I don't think it strange compared to other dreams cuz all of my dreams are stranger most of them. 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	Most of my dreams are strange. So I'm just trying to get down a lot of notes and maybe figure out why I'm having such strange dreams if there's a reason behind it or if it is normal. 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	Still want to see if I can remember reading something in my dream
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	I like what I have good dreams about him and I haven't had one in a long time.  So I guess the next year might like to have with him is one where I can move on him and hug him and pet him and feel him again.  I just see him in the Happy State. 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	I would like to dream about something that I am reading again so I can try to remember the words on the page.
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	That's interesting. I think sign language. I'm very very interested in sign language and I wish I could master that. Also Tara reading. I'm very into that right now, and I hope I learn to master that. 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	I think I'd be okay with that. I don't really use social media a lot. And I think this app is really cool. And I hope all use it everyday, especially for my dreams cuz that's what I mainly wanted to start a dream journal, but I do have written journals as well. So I think I'll be okay without my cell phone now without technology not so much because I need the computer at school. But yeah, I was at my phone I'd be all right. Just do things on paper. Talk to people by going and driving to their house. 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	I'm not an object in my body always deserve to be respected. 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	Yes, I think so. I have very strange dreams a lot.  I don't know that I necessarily like them or just like them. I'm very interested. I guess when I'm having them I'm I don't like it and when I wake up, I feel very groggy and I feel more tired. I feel drained.  But I do think they're interesting. I don't know that I want them to stop.  But I know that sometimes they can get excessive because sometimes they are very descriptive and very real and some of them are very scary.  And that happens I think more when I'm stressed out. I remember whenever I was first getting my job and was very scared of the unknown of how it was going to be if I was going to hate it or love it and I was very scared. I was having a lot of  like very surreal dreams that I could hear and taste and smell and my heart rate would go crazy and could wear very either stranger scary.  And those ones just made me miserable and tired all the time and even those I don't know that I want them to stop because I do find them interesting too, but I don't like when it happens a lot. 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	I don't think that I will necessarily have something similar.  To snot coming out of my nose, but yes, I do think I have similar of feeling drunk. I know.  I will make another note for another dream I had but that  a feeling like on drugs or drunk or like not right or of having like part of my body have something wrong with it that I can't control. 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	Heading home going home from the school and just knowing I'm on break. I am so happy about that. 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	I’m on break at Autumns house, and I might get to see my aunt today! 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	I was at my house on treemont there was a small party going on it was at least autumn me Paloma shawna Ashleigh Bradley Gibbs and others I don’t remember 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	I was at a park with two little girls that I was babysitting they were half black had golden skin and beautiful light brown and gold curly hair. The older ones name was Annie Kae and the baby who was still in a car seat carrier and had to be held was Emery. I was sitting at a park table wooden and the park had a lake beside it.
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	I'm a little bit stressful and actually pretty stressful but then also very good. It was humbling to say goodbye to everybody at work. Even though I'll be back in two weeks and very happy to be on break like very very happy and excited but very stressed out from having to get things done that I procrastinated on and where do today 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	Mostly my job. I think I'm scared to be looked at as somebody that is.  Not supposed to be where they are. And so I try and like push myself as hard as I can learn as much as I can about the new.  Things that I'm doing like track and volleyball and basketball that gives very scared to start those things will not track but volleyball and basketball, but I've been trying to learn and I try and work really hard and I try and help out with everything I can and be proactive and in the classroom. I try I just try and do the best job that I can do when like hugs  Cover everything that I'm supposed to cover because I don't want a disservice anybody by being in the position. I'm in. 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	No, I don't really like social media. I use it very rarely.  But for the most part I don't use or like social media. 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	Hopefully a few years at least.. 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	Yes or no, but recreational ones, I think yes. I don't think that's good for me. I think that.  Emotionally it's not something I can handle with traumas that I've had in the past. And so I'm not in a good State of Mind to do things like that. So it always ends up with a bad experience. I am afraid to take prescription drugs and I try to when I can so that I can make myself more used to it, but it makes me very nervous too, but I don't think I should be afraid of that. But I am especially prescription drugs like mental health drugs and things like that and that's more because I'm scared that I'm going to rely on it or I'm going to have to keep upping the dosage and that scares me. 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	Again, I don't really understand. 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	Woodrow Wilson Junior High 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	Not currently. I think I'm going to be again scared when track season comes to start coaching hurdling, even though I love it and I know a lot about it.  I don't know a lot. It's like running plans. And so it'll be new but it's not like super out of my comfort zone. 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	Yeah, I did already learned a lot of Thai language in high school. I wish I would have continued through college, but that's okay. I can still earn if I wanted to. 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	I don't know that I can't move on from him.  It's scary to think that I will.  We going to talk about that. 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	It made me very scared to ever drink and drive even if it's just a little bit and when I first woke up and made me scared to drive because these dreams make it feel like these things could happen. And so like I get scared that if I drive I could start just going out of Consciousness not because I'm on anything but just because like I'm scared my body is just going to do it. So it's very emotionally draining. But yeah, I feel more tired. I feel drained. I feel scared so bad for some decisions. I am I made in the dream like even if I didn't put the alcohol in my system like in my head in a dream, I must have done it and I just don't remember because a lot of times in real life i blackout So like it, I have a lot of feelings of guilt. 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	The main thing that stood out I think was the Hedgehog trying to run out and I was very scared got a lot of anxiety from that. And then also whenever I went into the cage and I think the floor tart started turning into either mud or bugs it started going from being kind of cool to very anxious and scary. 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	Again on this one. I don't remember much I  I was walking along the road. It was nighttime probably like either orally in the nighttime or very early in the morning kind of thing. And I was walking along the road and I felt  like I was on drugs or drunk.  Kind of in between those two feelings. Like I didn't feel like myself.  I don't think that's the best way to say either like I knew I was me but  I felt like I was not fully there.  And couldn't control myself completely. I felt like I did whenever I was on ketamine.  And I was walking along the street and all I really remember is feeling like my nose with stuffed up a lot and I'm walking I'd lie like I not staying in a straight line kind of coming on and off of the road.  And I went to kind of go blow my nose. I close my nostril with one with my hand on one side and blue and all of the star that came out had bugs inside of it, like maggots and mealworms kind of bugs and I remember looking at it. And at first I didn't realize it that I just come out of me and then once I did realize that I got really scared and so  I tried on the other side and more came out and maggots and bugs were just coming out of my nose and like I couldn't stop it. It wasn't running down my face but like every time I blow more would come out but because what was coming out of scared it was inside of me, so I kept blowing. I just remembered looking down at the ground and seeing it there and realizing that it come out of me and just feeling very odd. 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	No, I don't. I don't think I could be my dad if I wanted to be but I also don't want to be my dad. 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	Yeah, I hate them. I think now I don't hate new things. I  Felt anxious I feel very anxious about new things and it caused me to feel very overwhelmed. And then I lose a lot of sleep when I lose a lot of sleep I lucid dream and when I lucid dream, I'm very exhausted. So it's very much just mentally draining and emotionally draining whenever I have to go through a new experience because I just go into like a shutdown mode. 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	Having a lot of stimulus going on, parents coming home, many people asking me to spend time with them all at once.
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	I think  I kind of already put the sound adjust my attitude whenever I'm drained exhausted and 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	Probably whatever. I started volleyball. I think basketball was also out of my comfort zone but not as much as volleyball was so I think when I started coaching volleyball as much to the first few days that I went to Summer practice and I was really really out of my comfort zone. 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	Today? Yes the past few weeks. Absolutely not. 
jEcdkZm8jNgJSEABaXTmdUtU8T43	At Autumns house, her whole family came over. Her dad has been making me feel uncomfortable and everyone fights. Also my family is coming home and I feel bad for not making more time for them I don’t know why it makes me anxious when they call me or want me home.

jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	I don't know. I feel like my anxiety from them Talkin at me while I'm slicing their meat is just sort of going away, which is nice. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Well when I first started smoking, I was very bitter person. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	No.  I would say no, but it wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing for me.  It does scare me a little bit though, because her behavior is are concerning sometimes and the things she says are concerning. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Yes vaguely I distinctly remember grabbing her up.  Standing up grabbing her by her hair and dragging her but I don't remember much after that. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	How long did it take me to get the mule together?  about 30 minutes  3240 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Either Soviet seiling Public Schools hating the guts out of my life.  Or I would be jobless and has no money and also hit the guts out of my life. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Very much. So it's very bad for me, which is why I'm trying desperately to quit. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	I thought it was pretty but they weren't the prettiest braids. I had ever seen they were kind of small.  Done. So so not the best braiding style I've ever seen they didn't look, you know super grade on her. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	I love my dad very much.  Sometimes I don't know how to feel about the relationship with my father because I feel he is emotionally stunted and not fully grasping what it is like to be a dad.  other times I  I think that it's not his fault and I show him empathy because I believe he's mentally ill.  But I accept the relationship that I have with my father and it's not necessarily a bad one. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	I'm not sure why you said mule. I said nothing about a mule. But if you're saying how long did it take me to get the shrimp and everything groceries from the store probably took me a half an hour. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Actually yesterday was our one year anniversary. So it's been a year. We met November 23rd 2018.  And then we hit it off ever since.  started dating New Year's Day of 2019  and the rest is going to history. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	That's a good question.  I'm not sure. I think that people really take socks for granite as far as quality goes but really sucks can make a difference in your overall temperature of the body. How comfortable your feet are how comfortable they are in different shoes. I used to not wear socks at all on my feet and I thought that was better because not wearing socks always kept me cooler until I discovered breathable socks that were made specifically to keep your feet cooler. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	So now you correct yourself. Like I said about half an hour to do all my groceries. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	the least important thing  Sure, maybe our age.  or maybe  the way that we look  I guess.  I don't know. I was like garbage today, but  Got the most important thing in the world anyway. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Yeah, I think that would be really cool. I think that socks are a very underrated clothing item and I love being a part of any team. I love achieving personal call and that would be a really cool thing to be a part of. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	by her hair  She had braids in her hair so I grabbed her by her braids. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	I think you misunderstood my question. I did not miss Sophia I worked with her. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Off of Dominique my sister.  Cuz right now my mother cannot afford to lease for me.  And Dominique will give me her almost brand new very well cut car for $4,200.  And then that way I will have a very reliable good working vehicle to get me back and forth from where I need to go and work. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Oh my gosh, we've been talking everyday for over a year. He's my boyfriend. But today he texted me first and said good morning, and it was very sweet. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Absolutely. We're in love. He's my boyfriend the love of my life. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	I'm not sure.  But probably myself most likely. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	I was around a couple people while I was at work.  But for most of the day I spent.  Working with a woman named Sophia. So I spent about 4 hours with her today. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Not exactly sure. What you mean by this question. It seems like it's worded a little funny.  But the things that she says that are concerning are about you no chopping people's heads off and how she's beat up her husband and how she's violent and aggressive essentially and unstable. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	interesting question  I'm not sure what the best way to answer that question is but I have pretty good eyesight for the most part.  came for my parents in casting 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Definitely not the worst breeding style I've ever seen but definitely not the best. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	I remember it had something to do with Lilith.  the mythical logical satanic goddess and also Justin and myself 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	We haven't really argue with a lot but it seems like the argument that we continue to have is about him playing video games while I'm there. I don't mind him playing video games while I'm there and sometimes in fact, I really like it because it enables me to be able to do things that I need to do, but  When it's all day.  And we don't spend any time together whatsoever. And I'm just kind of there it does get bothersome.  And lonely and frustrating because I want to hang out with him. I want to continue to grow with him and learn more about him and do things with him to evolve our relationship continuously.  and I think that  if I had to own my part in this I think that it is the fact that I am a little bit hard on myself and down about my circumstances sometimes and I know that that can be bothersome more troubling. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Usher watching dr. Phil and smoking  so both of those things I know. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	I would improve being more upfront. I think I let things go on a little bit too much and it tends to come off as passive aggressiveness.  And then when I do get upset.  I get really upset. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	I'm not sure what you mean, but not for what reason not for the reason that I had a good time with my boyfriend. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	She doesn't really convey too much of his emotion.  He has to me.  And he has said that I make him feel things that I make him feel vulnerable. But if I can tell that he's upset or if he's worried.  Typically, I try to be as fun as possible as optimistic as loving as sweet. I try to snuggle him and cuddle him give him kisses sometimes if he sings seems angry like he needs to Stew I'll leave him alone for a while and then I'll give him a bunch of struggles. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	I think I'm going to enjoy this application.  Because it will allow me to re-read my conversations and understand what I sound like.  I think that I get stressed out a lot.  And I'll add an exhaust me.  And I need to get to a place where I don't let it exhaust me. And I remember that I have a goal and I want to reach that goal and it's important for me to hit that goal.  The difference between a goal and a dream is a timeline.  So I need to start getting myself timelines and learning how to work with in them.  So I can still take care of myself to accomplish what I need to do. So I don't let this stress exhaust me. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	I probably  something to do with Spratt  I have to I don't know, you know do more research on Lilith.  But from what I understand she is the mother of beasts.  And so perhaps I feel like some kind of beastly.  something is always following me and trying to do harm to myself and those I care most about 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Not really. I suppose I just wish I had someone to snuggle with. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	I decided to open up this app.  And it helped a little bit. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Well, I had some very creative dinner ideas, which was nice.  They made my own marinade and made fried potatoes and broccoli and it was all very delicious.  Enjoyed it rather much.  I also had the idea to cash in my 401k and my tax refund that way I can have half the money. I would need to be able to buy Domino's car off of her. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	That's a good question.  A new thought that I had today is maybe I am meant to work with this crazy co-worker of mine Kimberly to teach me some kind of a lesson either in patients.  Or humility or tolerance something or other? 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	I don't know if I would say that I contemplated an idea today, but I did think more about Justin and I living together and starting a family today. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	I did experience some new socks today funny enough you mention that.  I had experience thoughts of  genuine  confidence in myself to better myself into turn myself around it was like hopeful confidence that things could get better.  So that was really exciting and really interesting and I'm I'm glad that I'm slowly but surely making some really good progress. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Yes.  Because I understand that he's depressed and I understand what depression does to somebody.  And I'm very empathetic and can put myself in anyone shoes. So I do understand his Viewpoint and I do acknowledge his perspective and I don't want to Trump on it when it comes to the situation. I never want to make him feel like he has to choose between me and his friends.  I just think that when he plays video games all day everyday and then I come over to see him. I would like him to  kind of put that down so that we can have one on one time with one another. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	It's going okay. I got a little.  Overwhelming feeling of sadness going on.  I'm currently getting ready for bed. I'm getting ready to relax and smoke and chill out. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Length for throwing curve balls that I'm ready for them. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	I'm good enough just as I currently am. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	My opinions are true is who I am and what I believe. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Well, sometimes the problem is that I get too much sleep.  But my issue is that on the nights that I don't work. I stay up very late. And then I sleep through a large portion of the day and I have a hard time turning my thoughts off in my mind. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Something I'm excited about today is finishing the online portion of my training that way I can actually start working in the department. That would be really nice. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	I'm looking forward to going to dinner with the love of my life.  I really looking forward to going to this party. It should be a really good time. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	I'm looking forward learning on how to use the ovens.  That I can finally know how to do that.  And then coming home and relax. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	sing Justin for quick minute and  getting off work. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Relaxing and enjoying the beautiful weather probably going ice skating. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	I think writing when I get home is something I'm looking forward to later. Also talking to Justin just kind of relaxing, you know. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Today, I'm looking forward to more Boar's Head training and getting to explore the new storm war and help set up and stock that will be very exciting. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Eagerly awaiting going to see Alex and hang out with her. I'm going to get something to eat. Maybe even getting something a little alcoholic. That would be nice. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Today, I am eagerly awaiting doing more Boar's Head training I suppose and just kind of getting into my groove.  As of right now in this moment, I am eagerly awaiting going to go and get a coffee. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	I'm eagerly awaiting seeing my boyfriend and getting to spend some time with him. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	I'm thankful that my body seems to keep repairing itself. At least for now from all the stress and damage that I've done to it.  I'm also very thankful.  That I can still breathe after 7 years of smoking even though I do plan to not smoke anymore.  I am also thankful for how sturdy my body has seemed despite. Its  problems 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	love  I'm so grateful to experience love.  It is my favorite emotion in the most meaningful. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	focus on how great you are 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	the best part of my day  I honestly was probably seeing my co-workers while I was at work. I thought that was really awesome. Even though it was only for just a few brief moments.  And then coming home and relaxing. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	How calm and happy and positive everyone was?  How nice it is to work together as a team.  How wonderful it is at work when it's slow and also the touch of my boyfriend's lips on my face. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	I will Embrace everything that life throws me away. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Color or right I suppose. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Him not responding or calling me crazy. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	No, I haven't been up to anything lately because I don't have a car. I got to see my friends for a little bit earlier, but it was only about an hour and a half and we went to go get coffee. Other than that. I've just been cleaning the upstairs working. I've been seeing Justin maybe once or twice a week. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Nothing in particular happened. I was just sitting here thinking about all of the things that I need to do now that the holidays are over.  And I was thinking about how I need a new car.  And how I'm afraid that this job won't pay me enough and I'll still be struggling. It's just overwhelming.  And then I start to think about my mom and this scenario with her work and losing her job.  And then I go to bed on that and I try to think of ways that I can work at these problems tomorrow to make them better or to dwindle them, but they exhaust me so much that sometimes I just can't even do anything. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	I'm feeling very strange. I'm feeling sad lonely, but also content and okay Restless I suppose. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	I do. I wish that I got a little bit more done in a reasonable amount of time. I wish that I wasn't just getting ready to shower at 11:30, but I had to make a stop to see Amy and I talked with her a little bit longer than I anticipated and I had to DV vein all of my shrimp because even though the man said they were deveined they were not so it took longer than I expected to make dinner. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Yes, I would say I was very successful. I was able to get everything at work done on time above and beyond and I was even able to bring Justin some lunch today. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	I got everything done that I needed to and more I got to go out with my family and I put all of my gifts away already. I'm taking a bath. My room is clean upstairs. I made some fried Oreos. So I was very successful in accomplishing my goals today. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	An opportunity I feel grateful for is having this full-time position at my work. Definitely. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	The way I'm able.  To shut things out so that I can focus. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Definitely my relationship I would say going very well like more well than I would have ever expected it to ever ever in a million years.  And I am so very thankful for the love that I get to share with Justin. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	What is currently challenging me is that I have to get up and go to work and I can't relax and enjoy this beautiful day outside, but I am grateful that I have a job and then I can make money and then I am learning new skills and my coworker seem to like me. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	I'm thankful to enjoy my very warm heater.  in my stupor cozy bat 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	My phone so I can communicate with those closest to me and look up information. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	I do feel thankful for today my body.  Feels a lot better than it did yesterday. I have more energy and I don't feel is full of crap inside the mucus. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	A little bit of column A a little bit of column B.  It depends on the matter at hand that upsets me. If it's something that I perceive as small and I could just be overreacting based on.  In a rational thought that I'm having then I try to leave it alone until I calm down or feel better because I try my hardest not to be passive aggressive though. Sometimes I don't succeed but more often the night if it's something serious, I will discuss it because I know that I can't go on forever without talking about this out in the open. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	No, I think I'm good.  Well, actually  pink impossible  that I could be dreaming these things because there is an aspect of my personality or maybe  I feel like something that is attached to me. That is always going to find me that is always going to try and ruin happiness for me. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Gas difficulty breathing pains and fearful feelings things like that. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	It was in color.  And no, I don't remember any symbols. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Friday was good for the most part. I was just really tired. I think I'm going to try and hit to bed early like fall asleep by 11 so I can wake up at 7:15 then get ate a little bit over eight hours of sleep. That would be nice.  I worked a lot today. I worked from 9 to 4 and then I came home relaxed did what I need to do to do some laundry. Did my facial routine wrote a little bit and now I'm getting ready to do bedtime yoga, and then I will be laying down. I'm going to sleep. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	I slept over Justin's.  We spent a lot of time.  Cuddling, which was nice.  Then we woke up got high. He went to go look at cars. I took a nap.  And then I ran some errands did a little bit of grocery shopping.  Prepped for tomorrow.  And now I'm getting ready to shower smoke and lay down for my day. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Well today was Christmas. So I celebrated with my family. I got to invite Justin over to spend Christmas morning with us and I got to spend Christmas day with his family is very fun. Just a lot of running around a lot of things to do but it was a very good Christmas side liked it. It's been the best one in a long time I'd say 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Well, we were super slow at work, which was awesome. Everyone was in a great mood. We were actually able to get everything done and on time today for the most part, which was also super awesome.  I got free sushi. Brandon bought me Starbucks.  And I got to take Justin lunch. And also I got to spend the night with him last night. So that was great. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	I did some yoga and listen to some meditation music. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	I did a bunch of mental health work and I'm doing face masks right now. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Coco lunch break  laid in my bed and ate some pistachios while watching Kitchen Nightmares. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	The only thing I think the ice have on my agenda today wolf. Sorry, I can't talk.  But the only thing I have on my agenda today is to go to work. Other than that, I don't have any.  Special plans are obligations that I have to adhere to I might come home and clean up my room a bit. But other than that, you know what I do have to go to Walmart and pick up my prescription. So there is that'll be doing that after work. So work prescription come home. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	I have a decently busy day today. I have to make myself breakfast. I have to meet lunch then I want to take lunch to Justin while he's working and then  I have to go to work work is the most important of course, but second to that and probably just as equal as bringing Justin some lunch. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	I absolutely have to go to work today.  And that's the only real obligation that I have to do I suppose. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Today I absolutely have to go to work. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	While I'm just a little bit my best friend. Jared is going to pick me up and we're going to go shopping for their drag show coming up. And then later this evening. I'm going to go out to the movies with my boyfriend and his family to see the last Star Wars. But other than that, I don't have too many plans. I have to go pick something up from Amy at some point either today or tomorrow, but the rest of the day is full of relaxation. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	It just made me feel like in the end. I'm going to end up losing the person that I love the most.  and I don't think it's because  I don't love myself. I do love myself. There are some things I'm kind of hard on myself about.  But I mostly just feel uncomfortable.  In in my home with my mother my parents.  Have made things very difficult and I think they underestimate how severe it was. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	littlest cats finding me in haunting me  cursing me with disturbing images and thought  trying to hurt me and we were surrounded by a bunch of animals at all times. We had a bunch of pets for some reason and she kept trying to do harm to them and Justin. And mostly just scare us. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	I was grateful to be able to hang out with Brendan and see him for a couple minutes. I really enjoy his company. He is easy to get along with. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Everyone's I felt so thankful for everyone especially Justin and his family. I would say just because I didn't expect them to think of me the way that they did try this holiday season, you know, I feel very part of the family and like I finally have another family and like I'm finding the person who is really meant for me and I'm really appreciative that he let me share both sides of that with him today my and has 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Something nice, but someone has done for me.  Would be my mom snow blowing the driveway so that I don't have to go outside and do any of the shoveling or snow-blowing.  My coworker smoking me down.  My boyfriend spending time with me.  My best friend hanging out with me at 1 in the morning and then we go and get top or I'm sorry we go and get IHOP and get high. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	I felt uneasy like someone was attacking my mind. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Well today is going to be pretty busy. It's New Year's Eve. So I have to drive up to work in a little bit to do more training. And then after that I have to come home finish up a couple things around the house and then get ready for our New Year's Eve party that Justin and I are going to it's also our anniversary tomorrow. So we're kind of doing a two-for-one celebrating. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	I think I'm going to finish my laundry and then I'm going to finish cleaning the upstairs area here with the ceilings in the walls and everything like that. Maybe get a head start on cleaning the kitchen just to kind of make sure that everything is finalized and finished by the time we go into the New Year tomorrow. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Well, I have to work today.  So that is the most important thing on my to-do list, but other than that nothing really set in stone. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Well, I'm working from 10 a.m. To 6 p.m. And then after I have to go to Walmart pick up my prescription.  and then  and something else I had to get low. I was out. I was pretty sure.  I can't remember at the moment. But I know I have to go to Walmart and then I'm going to have to come home and you know, get ready for bed stuff like that. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	In order of importance, it would be in finishing cleaning out the fridge cleaning out the rap cage.  And then doing something to relax for myself since I have to go back to work tomorrow. So I was thinking of going ice skating. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	I'm going to go and get lunch with Alex.  Then we're going to go shopping have a girl's day.  And then I'm going to be hanging out with Justin later tonight! 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	disappointment uncertainty  exhaustion  fearfulness 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	I'm thankful for all of the amazing things that my body can do. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Guess I'm sitting out here on the roof talking to you.  Knowing that I don't have anything particularly important to do tomorrow besides go to the movies. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	I feel like I will probably have a dream like that again.  And I don't particularly like having them. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	A nice experience today was that it was someone slow and not working with Kim. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Today I learned.  That quality of products really makes a huge difference. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Something special that happened today was I got a bunch of makeup that I need it and face products that I need it.  I also got to sleep next to and wake up next to the love of my life. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	A simple pleasure. I enjoyed today was getting to wake up next to my boyfriend in my own bed. And also going on a walk with him and doing things. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	I noticed that I started to become lethargic.  And that some of my illness sick symptoms started to come back. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Well, my day is over now.  I've been up for a long time and it's finally time to go to sleep. I'm in bed much later than I wanted to be but the good news is that I should still got over 7 hours of sleep in a hurry up here and lay down.  And mostly went shopping today. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Well, all I did today was work and then chat with my mom, but it was a wonderful day at work. I was very excited. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	My day's been pretty good so far. I can't complain. I did some relaxing. I did some things.  So it was a nice balance, I guess. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Well today I work and I noticed that they shorted me about 6 hours on my pay stub. So that kind of sucks and I have to talk to management tomorrow. My mom tried arguing with me over the car.  Because she feels uncomfortable that I want to do things after work.  And that's about it. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Well, I already spent most of the day with him and I'm home now.  But I showed gratitude for him by spending the day with him.  And by spending time with his family.  Enjoying the Christmas holiday with them. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Write down what you're thinking and read it back to you because you'll realize how crazy it sounds. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	We went to hell Mitch Park. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Very well yet, but it feels like we could be very very good friends. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	me  I need to head over to the new store after training of the old store. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	To an extent, but I feel like I will always partially think about how I can help people because I love helping people and I think the best one of my goals in life. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	I got to go bowling and hang out with the love of my life still. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	No, I don't think so.  Because I'm defending myself. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	So that they can have stability and be able to travel and do the things that they want to do. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	I think that question was phrased a little bit strangely.  But I work at Kroger.  So by the time I get out, it'll be 6 and it'll be dark, but hopefully it's still.  And I can enjoy that at the eclipse. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Because they also smoke weed just like I do and it's generous so that I don't have to use my own Supply. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	How much more efficient would I like to be after work efficient enough to wear? I'm not going to bed close to 4 in the morning. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Why would someone want to meet the two of us because we are awesome and cute and down-to-earth and fun to be around.  And expecting and kind. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	I think if he is really willing.  To continue motivating himself and to continue growing himself as a person and I do as well.  I think will become more stable people and therefore will be a more stable couple and will be even better able to help each other.  I think that we also need to keep communicating when something's wrong.  I shouldn't wait or try to see if he'll gas Wylie. I'm upset. I just need to let him know or if I know that I'm being irrational. I need to get over it simple as that. So I think as long as we both keep evolving as people and we both keep becoming even better. It will continue to make our relationship more stable. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	A noteworthy moment from my day would have to be when I opened that bracelet up from Justin.  Because it just fell.  So nice and so real and very serious between he and I so it was just that it was a wonderful moment. I got to share. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Maybe a day that I go over to see him. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	This beautiful weather and positive attitude going ice skating. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	This morning. I'm feeling really grateful for myself.  Because I've been taking some pretty.  Good steps and actions on working to better myself and grow and evolve as a person.  I'm also grateful for my co-workers at work for being so kind and generous and sweet. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Funny, excuse me.  Time with my friends I would say.  I usually do take that for granted.  Partly because I don't see them very often partly because of some other feelings that I feel inside. So I am thankful that Jared wanted to go shopping with me and spend some time with me today. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Something to do today to take care of myself with listen to relaxing meditation music while I got ready, and I also did my morning routine on this application and currently I am going to get ready to do a bit of writing and I'm going to eat dinner and I'm going to take a shower and then I'm going to do some night time yoga and get ready for sleep. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Play excitement about the day I would say.  And how awesome work went and my really nice coworker. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	We had training for our premium brand Boar's Head and that made me happy because it was a very informational very exciting training and I always get excited with good information good training. I got complimented a lot which was awesome. Apparently people have been saying a lot of really good things about me, which is fantastic. And I was also approached by my HR manager asking if I wanted a full-time position and that made me very happy. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	My ideal tomorrow looks like having another awesome day of Boar's Head training and then working through the rest of my shift at our new store helping set up.  And then probably just coming home tomorrow and relax and getting some things done maybe doing a little bit of cleaning hanging out with my friends if they're off work and they want to hang out.  That would be a great day. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	An experience I was grateful for today was going through that Boar's Head training. It was very very helpful and very informative and it makes me a lot more confident working in the deli. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	very good question  when I let Justin meet my father.  about 2 weeks ago  or even you know, just working in in this new environments and pushing myself to talk to people and learn how to use all of the equipment and things like that. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	No, I don't think it was anything directly.  But I think that sometimes the silence allows for me to think about thoughts that stress me out. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Well, I got to see a me like I said, which was amazing because I love her and I haven't gotten to see her in a while and also the dinner that I made was freaking awesome. I was very impressed with myself, especially how quickly I got all of it done. I cooked it all in probably half an hour. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Made me feel not heard.  taken advantage of  fearful for the future  and sometimes  angry  I think this is influenced our relationship by not really enabling us to  hang out with one another and to get to know one another even better than we already do.  And it makes me feel very low. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	My favorite part of the day today was eating my macaroni and cheese and hang out with Brendan. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Today I learned how to ignore people who are ignorant or at least got a little bit better at it. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	moving around in exercising I would say 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	tomorrow I can smoke no cigarettes, that would be better and also going to sleep earlier would be better than focusing on my training waking up on time so that I can  stay to my schedule and structure. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	I'm grateful to be able to look forward to making more money.  And I am grateful to look forward to.  getting healthier 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	honestly, I feel thankful for my phone for these mental health apps and I'm allowed to use and help structure my day with 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	I had a dream.  That Justin and I were staying at some kind of a hotel.  Some kind of community housing something like that and we were hanging out with a bunch of people. We were really liking their company enjoying our time with this and that  And in my dream there is a girl from work who I actually like very much. She's awesome. And she's 39. I think my body just used her.  As the person to represent something else, but anyway could dream flashed and we were sitting in some kind of living room. I think it was his supposed to be his grandparents house and it was meme him this girl a bunch of other people who we were friends with him. We were all watching a movie.  Well the girl that I work with.  started massaging my legs  and kind of touching me in a romantic way.  When I asked her what she was doing.  She apologized and then reached over me and started touching Justin, which I immediately got very very angry and said what are you doing? And she said well, I thought you said that you wanted to have a threesome.  Or that, you know you wanted to do things with me.  And I said no and you didn't even ask.  And so shortly after that I had gotten a Justin had gone outside with a bunch of people.  I beat up this girl. She seems to vanish and disappear Into Thin Air.  Then I went outside trying to find Justin and Justin was outside partying having a good time didn't understand why this was so upsetting to me and why beat her up he wasn't mad at me, but he just seems to almost like he was getting drunk and partying outside.  I remember being upset with him. Like what the hell? Why are you not upset about this and then waking up? 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Small acts of kindness I would like to start practicing as being kind to myself and saying nice things to myself everyday. It's getting the practice of thinking and believe in good things about myself. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	For the most part. I feel like I could have used it a little bit more efficiently after work. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	for the most part, I think that I could have been more productive, but  there's always tomorrow. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	I think so tomorrow should be a good day. It's going to be a short day and get to go on a bit later my last day of that training then I get to head over to the other store. It should be a pretty easy day learning the ovens and stuff and then I get to go home at 5, maybe even a little sooner but five. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Financial stability a new car and inner. Peace 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Definitely Financial stability. That is what I'm longing for in life right now. 
jKRlPLsoxRWqygPUwg3PIRuy69H3	Pretty good.  It seems like everything's been going pretty well with everyone.  For the most part, my mom has been a little difficult to get along with but other than that, it seems like my relationships are all getting better and better.

jagyuB1zOtfus2SSdJIkrK1hBLl1	I don't even pick repetitiveness is that you just do the same thing every day you walk in you get in the truck to take the packages out the truck almost the same motion. You left push left. Push left pushed left. Everything is the same motion. That's what I meant about repetitive motion. 
jagyuB1zOtfus2SSdJIkrK1hBLl1	I think it's in buying luxury items that people can.  Can feel like they can only get them from you. But you know, that's flaunting wealth and that's basically not healthy because you know that money is not the source of Happiness neither is well for luxury. So, you know if I have friends only because I have a nice car those are not really friends. Those are just car people who want cars. That's it. We're not really my friends. 
jagyuB1zOtfus2SSdJIkrK1hBLl1	The day that I will be able to see what happens to the Future. It's actually everyday as I as I live through it as I live through it day-by-day. You don't actually Vision my future. I I always try to see what's ahead sometimes. I don't always do it correctly, but that's okay. I don't see it coming sometimes and I fall into a hole make a mistake, but the good thing is I learn from those mistakes. I'm starting to see into the future actually Aiea, for example.  When when I realized that it gets cold and then it starts snowing. So I start preparing by buying sweaters and layers and dressing warmer and getting ready for the for the snow, you know, like when I see that I'm able to see what happens in the future. You know, like if everyday I sit down and watch the news I'm able to tell the forecast for the week ahead and stuff when it comes to like health issues, you know, when I when I squat outside and I'm not very well dressed then maybe I'll catch the cold, you know, if I've been outside in the cold too long. It just depends on what I do like if I come  When it comes to my mental health, you know on a day when I'm not feeling too good when I wake up on the wrong side of the bed or when something is affecting me and I'm anxious about something or problem. I know that I'm not in my best mood and my performance will will be directly cast on it and you you will be able to see it. You know that I'm not performing as best as I could have so you'll be able to see that. I mean I'll be able to see that in a future like yeah, if I'm angry, you know, I might just be angry.  Everywhere, I work at school at home, you know with family or friends. I'll just be angry and I know that's bad for the future cuz I'll I'll be rude to people they have nothing to do with it. So.  Day by day I'm learning. 
jagyuB1zOtfus2SSdJIkrK1hBLl1	I got this job as an unloader / shoulder at a UPS warehouse you can or basically you unload packages of a truck and then you put them on a conveyor belt. You sort two things. It's a good job, you know, it's physical or in the man's physical abilities to requires you to lift like 40 lb packages and move them around use devices safely and move around fast quickly work as a team cooperate. It's a good job. It's a union job is of Labor its labor. And I love it, you know because of the exercise aspect of it working with the hands, you know, a simple tasks. Everything is repetitive motions. Yeah. I love this job. 
jagyuB1zOtfus2SSdJIkrK1hBLl1	From my life. I would have lemonade the pursuit of money because money doesn't equal happiness. I would pursue happiness instead. So striving for riches driving for money and wealth. It doesn't mean  happiness to me and it doesn't mean that at all.  That would eliminate that for my life. 
jagyuB1zOtfus2SSdJIkrK1hBLl1	if you don't if you don't follow through on your plan, you are at risk of losing your job because  all it takes is a big mistake for you to just throw in the towel and not complete and to fail and so when that happens is  you you really didn't accomplish your tasks. You didn't manage them well, and then you end up losing the big picture who end up forgetting.  To move forward and it's a setback. It's a big setback, but you can get back from it. You just have to try again when a new problem arises when a new situation new opportunity for a new job occurs. You just try again.  But you always have to come up with a plan and stick to it and see it to completion in order to see the results. 
jagyuB1zOtfus2SSdJIkrK1hBLl1	Yes, absolutely. Your hobby can be something you are addicted to look like if you're playing guitar. For instance. You might be addicted to a guitar playing guitar music and playing your guitar and whatever your hobby is if your if your hobby is to practice kick boxing or martial arts. You might become addicted to the whole lifestyle of martial arts. It all depends on how much you use the hobby how much you act on the Hobby and how much you practice it will determine if you are addicted to it and I becomes habits. 
jagyuB1zOtfus2SSdJIkrK1hBLl1	How long does it take to get cold in the North Pole?  The North Pole is already colditz.  It's very cold in the North Pole.  It doesn't take very long for it to get cold because it's already snowing up there in the North Pole. You already got glaciers ice and it's already freezing. So the water is already freezing cold. So it doesn't take very long for the human body to get cold there. Like if your a human and you just go to the North Pole your body temperature really drops, you will instantly get cold. You'll freeze might get hypothermia. If you're used to those conditions like a like an Arctic bear or like a polar bear.  You won't you won't that dramatically colds you want experience it dramatically Kohl's but you will be up there as a bear, you know, keeping warm with your fur and urine test your natural conditions Metro living conditions natural climate, but there's certain species that wouldn't survive the North Pole. So it's very cold in the North Pole by Nature by default. 
jagyuB1zOtfus2SSdJIkrK1hBLl1	The waiting room was before therapy and was at 2:30. 
jagyuB1zOtfus2SSdJIkrK1hBLl1	It starts in your mind starts in your heart. You have a passion for it. You feel it. It it calls you it calls you towards it. So it's like if you have a a passion to become a singer you just you know, when you hear music and then you start singing it because you like it you if calls your heart your heart is drawn to it. So I think the addiction to a hobby is comes from the passion you feel for it or the the way it makes you feel when you're practicing the hobby when you're actively engaged in Mojave. 
jagyuB1zOtfus2SSdJIkrK1hBLl1	Food plan because they plan to succeed at everything without a plan fails. You can't free.  Re wing it all the time. You need a plan needs to establish a plan. That way you can stick with it and you can follow through on it until you get the end desired results. That's why you need a plan. So what I do is I stick to my plan at work and that's how I get the job done. If I need help. I find out who can help me if I need resources I get the resources and that's how I come up with a solution for the job. 
jagyuB1zOtfus2SSdJIkrK1hBLl1	I think they should not feel like that. I think everybody should be able to get things for a fair negotiable reasonable trade not from you know, very expensive just because it's expensive, you know, it's got to be a fair trade. That's what I believe. 
jagyuB1zOtfus2SSdJIkrK1hBLl1	well, the scientific answer to why does it get cold in the winter is because  the  the earth rotation it tilts on its axis and you know.  at a certain time at a certain rotation in the seasons of the earth is actually like tilted I'm certain way that the Sun hits the top part of the the bottom half of the Equator, you know more than it hits the Northside so it gets colder during these times and it gets the sun rise earlier in the morning and it falls and sunsets is earlier during the day which we use daylight savings times for  And it just drops degrees drops gets very low very good degrees get low the air gets cold and it's get windy. I think it's cold because you know, the conditions the climate is changing Mother Nature needs to be changing because it is a dynamic environment where you know rain turns into precipitation and precipitation turns into clouds and clouds turn into rain once again, so it's a cycle of science are you know, it's a natural cycle part of Mother Nature and them  Reason why it gets cold is because the air that comes from the North Pole and you know that goes cold or parts of the globe and the Earth, you know from the oceans that cold air gets pushed all throughout the Earth and when it's winter time, we feel it the most in the Northern parts of the earth like America Canada, we we feel it, you know, but it in the east in the Northeast it gets really cold. But sometimes in the South that doesn't get as cold, you know, they don't really get much snow down south or down or over the West, you know, California and places like that.  But in those places is really hot. So yeah, that's about weather and it's natural. It's just natural weather-related information. 
jagyuB1zOtfus2SSdJIkrK1hBLl1	I was searching for an app on the App Store. 
jagyuB1zOtfus2SSdJIkrK1hBLl1	So today I had a different idea of when it comes to my girlfriend. I wanted to ask a guy. Why was this girl on my mind? Because like I work hard and I and I'm always thinking about this girl that I like and I don't know why but it's like she's always on my mind and then  When I'm working, it feels like I'm working because I want her butt.  I'm not supposed to cover. You know, I'm not supposed to desire something so much as it actually a sin and Desiring this girl so much while I'm at work that nothing. I mean while I even caused the accident and I'm doing my job because like my mind can't focus and concentrate on two things at once. So it was focusing on this girl that I like and Desiring her and wanting her and so my goal was to finish the job as quickly as possible so that I can  Have my free time so that I can go home basically and basically maybe get the chance to see her and then you know what my mind, you know take her home and stuff, but that doesn't happen. But that's what I mean old. Hope happens and that's what I think about you all the time. So my mind was thinking that that's my deal.  That was on my mind constantly. Also, I met a new guy, you know, I got to give people a chance, you know, just because color of their skin is different from mine doesn't mean they're not good people. So I made a new friend today and I noticed that I have to give people chances to to to be friends with them guys are not also, you know guys. Yeah. I know. I don't really like guys but like guys always give you work to do like a guy know a guy can give me a family, but he can give me work, you know, I can work for the man and  he'll provide money and stuff and then you know, if you want a family then that's when you go to a girl and talk to her about starting a family but guys can help you get money and provide for yourself survive, you know guys can teach you a lot about how to be a man and how to be a guy in general have confidence and things like that, but I feel like  I did watched enough guys already through their own things and and establish themselves as men and I just feel like it's my turn to do my part. And yeah, so a lot of the other a lot of ideas, you know of another idea was the keys to the city like I don't claim to be anybody important or big or or the mayor or anything like that. But you know, if you obey laws and you obey God and you will be Society in general like, you know, if you just do the right things, you know, you just avoid getting into problems like just avoid drugs avoid gangs and avoid negativity and just do the right things and eventually doors will open up for you and go to the keys to the city like, you know the job opportunities store that's open for me.  You know if I'm able to save up enough money to buy a car, you know, that's another door vehicle. You know, that's not the door opened up for me if I'm able to hone my skills and I don't know how to start a business go back to college anyting, you know, these are all doors that can open up for you. But you have to do the right things in order for that to happen. You got to work hard and you got to dedicate yourself. You got to be motivated or something and all I got at work. I was just thinking about in the beginning of this job when I got hired on to UPS. Like I saw the logo of UPS, it was like Lamborghini. It was like a Lamborghini logo and I was like, you know what I'm going to stay here long enough until I'm able to buy myself a Lamborghini. Yeah, the money comes in a little bit quicker now, but it's still going to take me a long time for me to buy a Lamborghini or like I'm probably going to be cold by the time I get I can afford one and nobody want  like work all their lives and then I could probably make enough money to buy one. You know I cuz I was thinking about earning it cuz nothing is free. Nothing is given everything is earned. All right, so I know I can't afford a Lamborghini with this job. I probably won't even be able to buy one like unless I become a manager that maybe I'll make enough money. I also learned that I'm not bossy. No, I'm not the boss of myself because of Boss decides how much he gets to get how much she just has to earn, you know, boss makes his own wages. He says his own hours and he works whatever he wants to work if he wants to do computer work if he wants to do accounting whatever he wants to do a boss. Does that but me a time at the bottom, you know, just doing what just taking orders, you know doing what people want me to do and getting paid with people want to pay me and all that's it. I realize I'm not a boss. You know, I'm a worker. I'm an employee, but I'm going to Hopefully, you know I get recognized for hard work and stuff before I I get too tired to.  Tawana continue, you know work is great. I'm feeling good. These are all the ideas I have today. 
jagyuB1zOtfus2SSdJIkrK1hBLl1	It was just enough mostly because I was sleeping most of the time. 
jagyuB1zOtfus2SSdJIkrK1hBLl1	Yeah, I always thought that the African-American people were like trying to destroy me or like not let me progress move forward but they're actually helping me I can actually see how they are helping me. You don't get ahead in life. They're giving me a hand and it's kind of disappointing when you're trying to help someone but they don't see it as how they see it as a as like you're not helping. So I realize that they were helping me all this time all along and I'm trying to be more nice and more passive, you know less aggressive and trying to work with them. I also remember Sitting down in the waiting room. I was impatient. I mean I was patient but like I was having a more relaxed Time by looking at the cars, and that was okay. That was great. 
jagyuB1zOtfus2SSdJIkrK1hBLl1	Something interesting I was able to think about today was the value of money.  How we make decisions with our money and how we spend it.  I was giving a lesson to my little brother about the $40 game versus a $1 game.  If he has $40, he can play the $1 game 40 times.  But if it's a $40 game, you can only play it one time.  So decisions when making money when having with money was something that I had to learn today.  sometimes  I have to sacrifice.  the new iPhone for rent instead or  very expensive  vehicle vs. Clothes food bills 
jagyuB1zOtfus2SSdJIkrK1hBLl1	I will keep working to develop true and accurate beliefs about myself. 
jagyuB1zOtfus2SSdJIkrK1hBLl1	I will be confident when talking to others because there is no reason not to be. 
jagyuB1zOtfus2SSdJIkrK1hBLl1	What I'm excited about today is riding my bike. I like to ride my bike. It's going to rain a little bit, but that's okay. I'm also excited about work again in the future the gym.  Today is Tuesday. So it's not too bad because tomorrow is Wednesday, and that's a good thing.  I don't have to like do a lot of work today unless it happens when ice it appears message shows up. You don't it's unexpected. Actually, I don't really know what's going on at work. Sometimes they want me to do this. Sometimes you want me to do that. I just do it.  so it's like it's a surprise sometimes but  And it keeps me on my toes. So I'm always excited for work for the day ahead for everything.

Yeah, man.  I look forward to going to the gym today coming home and getting some good sleep and doing it all over again tomorrow. 
jagyuB1zOtfus2SSdJIkrK1hBLl1	Today, I'm eagerly awaiting my bed. Actually like I don't want to do anything else some days. I wake up. I want to play video games some days. I want to draw listen to music color study. But today I just want to sleep some days. I want to go outside riding my bike. Listen to music play a sport Explorer take pictures out what I do want to do a lot of things.  But not today today. I just want to sleep. I don't even want to work, but it's a requirement of life.  You know we have to do it. 
jagyuB1zOtfus2SSdJIkrK1hBLl1	Okay, most memorable right now off the top of my mind is when I was working. I was really close to this girl named Esther. She's really cute and I get like  nervous when I'm around cute girls. I just don't know why and it was memorable for me because like I don't know. It's just a weird feeling me not being around girls that I like and stuff. That's what it's on top of my mind right now, but you know, it happens all the time. 
jagyuB1zOtfus2SSdJIkrK1hBLl1	Mana best part of my day was actually I put on this cologne that my girlfriend gave to me. I only want I want to wear it when she's around because she bought it for me. So I think she likes the smell and I wanted to wear it for her, but I guess you know, sometimes I'm smelling a little funky going to work and stuff. So I guess I need it and you know, I took care of my hygiene I brush my teeth and wash my face and put on some cologne so that I don't stink so bad others around me, you know, they might get offended by the smell. But this time, you know, it was a pleasant smell everywhere. I went it didn't smell so bad. Like I was being hit in the bad smell as being hit in the musty smell e-file armpit stinky. Sweaty smell wasn't so strong.  And I was great. Also when I arrive to work, it was really cute blonde girl walking by which I wanted to go after but you know, I got responsibilities like getting to work on time.  And yeah, it was nice to see her with her long hair. I'll just walking by freely Alone 2 and all she was alone. So that's a good sign. You know, I like when women are alone and kind of shows that they're available. But other than that, you know.  Yeah, that was the best part of my day. You know the smell it was good smell the play the smell and the sight seeing the girl was good best part of my day. 
jagyuB1zOtfus2SSdJIkrK1hBLl1	What made me the happiest was when I came home and my girlfriend called me on the phone? 
jagyuB1zOtfus2SSdJIkrK1hBLl1	I want to write in my planner.  My organizer I want to clean my room organize the laundry.  I want to remodel or redecorate my room.  and  I want to finish reading those children's books. 
jagyuB1zOtfus2SSdJIkrK1hBLl1	So why am I currently feeling very committed? What am I currently feeling very committed to in life.  I'm currently feeling very committed into the work.  the job  of my life the lifestyle. I'm living the purpose behind. My commitment is basically the future. I want to have my family to be happy and in a better economic position and I want to leave something behind for the future generations to come also, you know, everything works out better when you know, we leave something behind for those who are coming up in the world because kids, you know while they're growing up, you know, if we treat them like  Like they're worthless when when when we get older and they grow up don't treat us the same exact way. So we kind of have to Value the Young Generation the children, especially when you know, they don't have jobs. They can't work. So we we must take care of them and provide for them while they're young and help them grow and raise them for the future.  You know, the purpose is not to raise the family have them learn to appreciate morals values, you know, appreciate the dollar appreciate honest work hard work and jobs and an honest lifestyle living.  Earning a paycheck and a salary stuff. 
jagyuB1zOtfus2SSdJIkrK1hBLl1	Yeah, it's very important to prioritize tasks from order of importance. I God first thing in the morning wake up.  Take care of my personal hygiene brush my teeth use the bathroom if I have to wash my face, then I have to make coffee in the morning color to be alert and awake. So that's important for me to carry on the rest of my day and I'll being awake and alert. And yes, I wake up in the morning.  Are the bathroom brush my teeth wash my face go to the kitchen make coffee. Come to my room get dressed.  and put on some clothes check the weather see how much clothes how many layers I need to do to wear then I  I just know enjoy the coffee into the breakfast and  and then I  get ready to head out to work after all that is done. I don't really like wake up and read the Bible some people encourage you to do that to read the word of God in the morning.  Sometimes I don't do that but I do that at work. Sometimes it's important as well because it's something that I want to have on my mind when I wake up. I'm going to have the word of God and I want to have the  do you know the  The scriptures on my mind first thing on my mind. I want to put God first and  I think I used to text my girlfriend first thing in the morning, you know, but she's not my ex girlfriend, but you know, it's just a little challenged and I got to say hi to my mom and stuff.  I said if I do in the morning and I still have to come home after work you are at work and I got to ride my bike to work and I got to you know, get to work safely. Then I got to get to work and when I'm at work, I got to start by cleaning the floors, you know mopping sweeping dusting.  Taking care of fish tank. I got to feed the fish. Should I change the water bowl? I mean the water I got to keep and toilets no scrub toilets down clean the foot pedals and stuff and you don't leave the office looking kind of clean for  for people to like patients to come and then after that  I have to  head out home. I got to handle the garbage star the garbage and all that stuff and I got to go home after I go home. I'm trying to rest cuz I'm very tired but sometimes my mom needs me breakfast. So then I would eat the breakfast and then go to sleep take a nap. I mean a really long nap. I really sleep for like 10 soon as I get home all the way up to like 4 as soon as I just have an hour to get ready to eat and to go to my next job because  I feel very tired and my body is sore hurts and my back is kissing all killing me and I got a bike to my way to work again, and then I work is a very physical job.  My whole body needs a lot of rest with us in the morning. So in the morning that I wrap it up at sleep, you know, I come home a little 10 to 10 and then talk I'm still sleeping. So yeah.

New thing that I learned about the 20 and 80% you know, 20% have to get done and the other 80% know can be.  Completed on its own time, but as long as I get the important stuff done like, you know, the most important 20%. You know, that's what counts and that's what matters.

jagyuB1zOtfus2SSdJIkrK1hBLl1	Something fun that I get to experience and I'm grateful for is Billy to ride my bicycle at the reason why I say I it's fun and it's an experience is a fun experience that I'm grateful for is because I learned I noticed that when it was even today it was raining. I ride my bike every single day to work and in the back home and everywhere I go I like to ride my bike and it's not just for fun. It's not just for exercise. It's also what I do leisure activities like a hobby for me cycling and it's like a sport for me. So that's the fun part of it. That's the fun experience. I get out of it, you know, if it was fun to ride down the streets and feel the wind. Breeze to see the site since it just Glide down the street, you know peddling and riding the bike is comfortable, you know, not for long distances obviously not in all kinds of weather and climate like not in during the snow. It's not as fun as more of an exercise Marvel workout. It's more of a chore during the snow, but they're in the summertime. It's like the most fun experience ever and it's not always summer time out here, but most of the time it's fun. So that's what I'm grateful for. I learned that because I could have chosen to go a certain path today, but the path where I would have gone if I would have went through that Pat I would have got to dismount on my bicycle and walk for at least a block and I I learned that I would rather ride an extra block. And not walk that one block because riding is so much more fun. And I am grateful for the fact that they let me know that I'm permitted to ride my bike to know that the city of New York has bike lanes that they encourage bike riding that you know, the New York City residents. They allow bikes to ride on the roads. You know, I just have to obey traffic laws. That's it and it's a pretty fun experience overall. I'm grateful for thank you Bill de Blasio. Thank you, New York City. Thank you everyone who has made this possible. 
jagyuB1zOtfus2SSdJIkrK1hBLl1	I'm currently challenged by my relationship with women. I'm still not doing very good. I mean, I like so many women and that that's the bad thing because I need to start thinking with my brain instead of my my reproductive organs in my hormones and my testosterone in my Primal brain because Primal brain tells me you don't chase women get women produce and my my logic side of the brain tells me no calm down think about it. Make sure you're doing the right thing and I'm still grateful for it because I'm learning a lot about you knowing what life is love is emotions are and feelings and them I'm still grateful for all of that because it's helped me grow as a person my see how women can can better me and make me feel better. Like, you know, get off the couch do something new, you know, I do stuff and and live life and be happy but you know, it can also be challenging to understand what's happening. So that's why I'm still grateful for everything even though it's a challenge, but I wish it was easier. It's not it's difficult and managing relationships is challenging. and  I'm so grateful to have these relationships. So there's that. 
jagyuB1zOtfus2SSdJIkrK1hBLl1	This morning. I feel grateful for everybody.  On Earth sometimes like you don't even understand.  What other people are doing in their lives like yesterday? I was in the elevator and this lady spoke to me about the Super Bowl and you don't even realize that by starting a conversation about sports it automatically put a smile on my face first thing in the morning and sometimes we don't get that.  Out of our family members at home. Like you don't always good to see your parents in the morning. Wake up, but you know, it doesn't spark a smile on your face. It doesn't spark joy in me because you know, we take it for granted these things and them to hear about you know, like somebody else's Victory, you know, we were they were celebrating the Super Bowl they were happy about it and to hear that it's like good news. And so that put a smile on my face and I didn't even know it. It happened like out of the blue and you never know like who's out there, you know that we we could be happy for so I'm happy for a lot of people because  I'm just happy because I'm happy for myself.

jagyuB1zOtfus2SSdJIkrK1hBLl1	Okay, so I was coming home from work or something.  And I was walking down the street I was lost. So I was looking for streets trying to find a direction street that I knew so I can go home and I didn't know where I was. So I was just started looking around the neighborhood or anything that seemed familiar.  Nothing was familiar to me. So I was lost I was looking around kept making left turns and right turns.  There was a lot of color is like neon lights in stores.  With lots of colors and I was trying to find something that looked like familiar. So I found the train station. It was to be or the D or the F and it was the orange logo and I go up the train steps.  And that's what I noticed that I see some people there standing there. I don't have any money for the MetroCard so I can't get in the train. And so does the guys there one of them spit on me and they were talking about talking amongst themselves about something which I thought was a plan to attack me or assault me for no reason because I didn't have any money so they were just going to attack me for no reason at all. So I said when I did was I ran away and I ran to the outside of the train station I saw phone booth. I was looking for something to defend myself like a sharp blade or something and what I saw was a cup of chicken noodle soup, and I took the chicken noodle soup and  I said now what I need to find is a MetroCard. So I went to the MetroCard stations. I was looking for a MetroCard. I think I had some money to pay for my MetroCard now. I don't know how I got the money to pay for the MetroCard, but I was going to pay but I chose not to because they were still there.  Until I turned around and I made an exit while I was walking out. There was somebody selling sneakers there. They had like a whole display shoe rack of Jordans Nikes sneakers are on the train station subway platform, and I was looking for my size, but I couldn't find any in my size. So I just left and I laughed and I laughed.  I left and I ran and I ran and I said I got to get away from these guys because now they are more dangerous. There was this one guy who was with me who was supposedly on my side or an ally or my friend, but I don't know if I trusted him that much because he was just he was like the guys I was running away from he was black too. So I was I don't know if I can trust him and so I ran in the rent and nobody was out there on the streets. It was just me alone.  The streets was gray. There was no sunshine. It was no night lights and it was just great streets. The supermarket door was red. I saw it, but I didn't go inside. I kept running police car was parked somewhere. It was white red and blue. I kept running. The grass was not green. It was like gray. I kept running houses were beautiful, but they were just, you know difference and some of them are gray. Some of them were red. I just got the running. It was a nice neighborhood with a lot of fancy things like statues and Parks memorials. I just kept running.  Then I saw a church far away the middle of the road and I kept running and I kept running and I walked up to the church and I ran up the steps and then I got inside. I went all the way to the front of the church and I saw on my right hand, LOL. There was a tablet there and you can put your hand there for some reason and I would have touched it and I put my head my right hand on the tablet and I saw like a judge and a lawyer and a slideshow of pictures that I put my then I was like what what does that mean that I put my left hand and then I saw a family I saw kids children like angels and women and then I said, woah, so I backed up and then I turned around and somebody walked in and they said hi the church is about to begin. Sit right here. This is where we we sit down the young kids and they're going to be here so you can wait for them when they come in and the pastor came and he started the church right away. The kids were there this young kid who I knew I mean no, he's he looks familiar in real life, but I don't know who he is. But he's just a young kid. He's slim he's good-looking. He has a nice haircut and so he's there.  And he's on and so the mass begins and and he's with some some friends of his, you know, there's this girl with a turquoise sweater and he's there and so the match begin and in the pastor is saying these these words and. Everybody's repeating them and then they put some music on and every when a pastor claps everybody else claps. So it was playing like a game of follow-the-leader and then all of a sudden the pastor start walking and he's walking closer to me and he's speaking about the grave and he's speaking about like well murder at this point because he said something about a machete and he said something about killing me or someone killing. Someone was talking about a dead body.  And at this point everything is normal. Everybody's listening and everybody's repeating but I'm the only one that's like, okay. This is all new to me. I've never been here before. I don't know what he's talking about, but he's getting closer to me and then he looked at me in my eyes and the more he looks at me and my eyes the more I start to get this sense that we are not in this world anymore that we're in the new dimension now that the the Gates of Hell have now open and then all of a sudden I look at my wet the wall around me and it was red. It was Dripping in Blood and stained with blood that used to be yellow. And then I look at the people the kid in front of me. He's going up and everybody else in the church is going up. I see that the people behind me are floating up or levitating and  And everybody else is going up.  And before it's too late, I grabbed onto the kids shoulder. I grab onto it. I'm like wait a minute.  Wait a minute. I'm falling down and I look down at my feet and it's getting dark is getting pitch black and I'm starting to get scared. So I look at the pastor. I'm like what's going on here, you know, you're the leader of above this and I look at him and he's got these black eyes teary eyes, and he's got Blood Stained teeth and they look like vampire fangs except that they're sharp all around in his mouth. And and then that's when he's looking at me and I can tell that I had just  Open the portals to hell and I was going there. I was the only one going into hell at that moment. Everybody else in that church was basically protected by avail.  and when the church was over I walked and I walked to the front of the church and  now I hear some people shouting outside my window and this kid was writing down my name and this other girl was there. She was beautiful. She was white with blue eyes. She told me something is that what I was crying at this point. I was like you're going to be okay and I just didn't want to deal with talking to her. I was scared to death and  After that the pastor he went somewhere.  And then that was the end of my dream that's where I woke up right there and right then and there but I realized that my life was basically a path of Destruction when I'm when I'm listening to this.  music filled with crime with these videos with these movies My Lifestyle was one of pain and suffering and  Not fun, but you know glorifying the drug use and the illegal money all of that bad stuff. Delete yourself.  It was a very bad dream. It was life like because my mind was in a good place and a bad place at the same time. It was a bad setting in the big it was a good setting in the beginning. I was coming home from work. So I started off as a good dream then it turned into a bad dream. It was a bad setting where I was getting chased by gang members and then a good setting again when I feel when I got to church and a Bad setting when the church turned into a hell of a place to the place where I go to hell and  And then it turns good again when the kid was was writing down my name and I said you're a good kid. And then the girl with the blue eyes was trying to talk to me then to turn good again in the pasture. Yeah. I was very scary dream. I don't know what that means. But I want to save it down and listen to it later for the future so I can talk about it and maybe bring this up to my therapist appointment for something important.  So yeah, that's why I'm saving down his dream.  it's a nightmare to

And. Pepper and I used to eat that sandwich. It was about a foot long and then on top of that I drink like a nutrament performance drink and I started to gain some weight and all of his friends would like his friends is like your son is getting chubby man.

jagyuB1zOtfus2SSdJIkrK1hBLl1	No, my company does contribute to society because it delivers packages to the people who maybe don't know how to go to the stores and order them, or maybe it's too far away from a different country. So the company contributes to the society very much.  And by being a part of that company I'm able to contribute. I also have a first job as a first job where it also contributes to society because it's the doctor's office and patients that go in with pain and suffering on their feet and people are able to come out of there and they're able to walk and they're able to to you know, I have better quality of life with their feet. So the the jobs that I do they contribute very much to society in every way. 
jagyuB1zOtfus2SSdJIkrK1hBLl1	Maybe not maybe yes, some people are addicted to different things. Like people are addicted to Hobbies like art fishing or collecting rare items and others are addicted to buying technology phones and others are addicted to Fashion. Everybody usually picks their own addiction their own poison at Van. Nope, if it didn't happen to anybody then that person would actually be the addiction they would actually be the person that everybody's addicted to or providing it. 
jagyuB1zOtfus2SSdJIkrK1hBLl1	She was celebrating a birthday party. 
jagyuB1zOtfus2SSdJIkrK1hBLl1	No not ice. It's a surprise.  I want a surprise when I get what I do is I get excited but  That happens.  When less call ICE something unexpected doing something unexpected shows up at work. I always get it done.  Even though it takes me some time to think about how I'll get it done cuz I have to come up with a plan because if you don't come up with a plan you're going to fail so I always come up with a plan how I'm going to do the job. So that's how  What I do. 
jagyuB1zOtfus2SSdJIkrK1hBLl1	the song imagine if you if you  Have a company but the company doesn't have any work and I know sometimes people say there's always work. But what if it just slows down work slows down and people get laid off. That's what I'm talking about. That's when people don't have any work to do and that's something that we should be thankful because we have work. So that means we have jobs and that means we have money so that's good and  That's the only way we one cannot do their job unless you know what you're talkin about jobs at home like you have chores to do at home like throw out the trash and take a shower and dust the house and sweep and mop and clean and you know, keep the house clean and tidy if we don't do that, you know that's being lazy. So that's something that I'm facing a challenge right now. 
jagyuB1zOtfus2SSdJIkrK1hBLl1	Okay, Billy was not riding. His bicycle. Billy was not riding the bicycle.  I think I said Mayor Bill de Blasio and you probably heard Billy Bill de Blasio is the mayor and he allows the streets to have bike Lanes. So that's why I said he's I don't know. He's the mayor or the governor, but he's someone important New York City and he kind of makes the rules, you know, the laws that protect cyclists like me who choose to ride their bikes everyday to work. If you want to come you know that you was bike riding like me everyday.  So I was just giving him a shout out as thanks like to thanks to to the guys who make the laws that say it's okay to ride your bike on the road. As long as you follow the traffic laws. Yeah, that's good. That's it. Billy is a cat that my girlfriend likes to take care of and he doesn't ride bikes. 
jagyuB1zOtfus2SSdJIkrK1hBLl1	I don't know how a person might feel when I don't comment about sports. Maybe they feel like I don't watch sports. Maybe they feel like I'm not a fan. I like they are but I am a fan of sports. I like Forest Sports. I play sports. How do I feel when someone doesn't appreciate Sports the way I do. I feel kind of a disappointed. I'm like a mad. Come on. You should be cheering with me. You should be celebrating with me and they are like, you know what? I don't know that I'm not into sports, you know, I'm into other things and I'm like, okay well, It's all right, you know they don't have to like sports, you know, maybe give it some time to like sports. Maybe I don't like what they would they interested in but maybe give it some time. I might be interested in that. It's everybody's allowed to have the freedom of their own whatever they choose and if they want to comment on sports or not. It's their choice, you know, it's not I can't force them to choose to comment about sports. But like if you go to the Sports Talk centers, you know like ESPN and if you watch Major League Baseball live radio on stuff, you know, you'll hear a lot of people who are passionate about sports and they give the good commentary and they talk about athletes all day and night and talk about pros and they have radio stations dedicated to it. News has a sports section. So I know there's people out there who love sports so when somebody doesn't comment about sports, I know that there's somebody else who will if I'm willing to talk to that person. 
jagyuB1zOtfus2SSdJIkrK1hBLl1	I don't have a car cuz she usually comes by in an Uber or by bus. She doesn't really drive to take the bus but I when I go to see her I take the bus and the train for transportation. I have a bike. That's what I use. That's my vehicle. I get to my job with my bike. I go everywhere with my bike sometimes.  And I do not have a car, but I can rent a car. It's very easy to rent one nowadays to like rent one for a day for a few hours for a few minutes whatever and I have a driver's license. I don't have a car.  If I had a car, it'll be any car that's like you just get me around that works.  Yeah. 
jagyuB1zOtfus2SSdJIkrK1hBLl1	And today I would just like to remember that it's the beginning of the year 2020 and we need to have a vision.  focus and position I would like to remember that because you know, it's something that  something that's inspiring and it's going to motivate me to accomplish goals and to be realistic and to be organized and  What successful I think it'll bring me happiness. If I if I'm 18 does positive attitude this mental Clarity in this piece.  When the times get hard, which they will inevitably I will you don't take time. Take the time to calm down to think about things too.  to calculate, you know my next steps into  You know be more wise when it comes in on following the Bible principles eventually, I'll be more wise.  and  I'll be able to foresee danger and  and hide from it so basically what I would like to remember is what I learned from the Bible for me in the Bible the Bible principles to lessons in  Yeah, well, I would like to remember those things. That was what I learned today actually, so I'm just remembering it all having flashbacks of it all. 
jagyuB1zOtfus2SSdJIkrK1hBLl1	The office of dr. Harry Lopez. It's a festive your office has Christmas decorations Christmas tree comfortable furniture that has plants and nice paints. Nice floors. Good location. Nice neighborhood. Tell my work environment right now. It's very positive for the mind. It's productive. It's helpful.  It's motivational.  He has a doctor's office. So it's very good.  profession  career-wise  Yeah. 
jagyuB1zOtfus2SSdJIkrK1hBLl1	Yeah, most recently and treasured experience was for me the most recent I think in the last one experience that I've had. My partner was when we went to the movie theaters and we went to watch this movie called crawl about alligators flooding natural disaster flooding and a man, you know, whether his daughter we ate we ate at the movie theater as he watched the movie I paid for the tickets which was generous thing of me because she usually does a lot of painful things when we go on dates and that's generous of her, but I also like to put in my part of I like to hold up my part which is like you known the guy I'm supposed to show that I'm interested that I value her company and that I'm willing to invest into our relationship. So we watch this movie. Day, it was nice. The two of us went together. It was just us two that was the greatest treasure part because I had her attention. She had my attention. I was worried if she ate good if she ate well and she has to go to the bathroom. Everything was okay. I watched her bags and stopwatch the stuff and her food and  You know, it was a tragic experience. You came over to my house and she met my mom I wasn't yeah, she did see my mom that day and it was a good movie to watch together with her. I don't really watch a lot of movies in the movie theaters and watch them at home. But if it's on a date with my girlfriend, then I'll go out and to the movie theaters and watch it.  At the theaters or we can watch it at home. I don't really mind if she wants to go out if she wants to stay in. It's really just a matter of accommodating her knees at the moment and making her feel comfortable for me and stuff.  Yeah. 
jagyuB1zOtfus2SSdJIkrK1hBLl1	Oh when my partner does that makes me smile is that she's funny in her own way. She laughs at my jokes. And I think that's funny and cute because I'm not even funny all the time, but she still laughs at my jokes. So I think that that's how I know that she likes me and in her liking me I tend to like her and smile and that's what she does that makes me smile. You know, she just likes me. She smiles at me. She laughs at my jokes and she's just got a good sense of humor a good personality. She's funny. She's sweet. She's nice and she's caring so In return, you know, I kind of mirror those same character traits when I'm communicating with her and talking with her. 
jagyuB1zOtfus2SSdJIkrK1hBLl1	For me the best date that we ever had together was the one where we went to the mall and we ate food at Applebee's I think it was with some food. It was good food. She ate her play time I played and we had a good meal. We didn't talk much but we had a good meal and after the meal we paid each for our own plates. And after that we just walked around in the mall holding her and spending time together, you know, she went shopping to her favorite store. She tried on her outfits. She she let me comment on them to say if I like them or not and She didn't allow me to pay for The Outfits, but I wanted to but I just didn't make enough money I guess so she didn't allow me to then after that. We walked she walked me to the bus stop and she let me go home and it was a good date for me. I say that was a good date because we were out in public and we were seen by people holding on as a as a good.  Part like we we look like two people who are really interested in getting to know each other and going on dates and getting to know one another.  It was something new for me. I was I was happy at that time.  And for me that was the best date we ever had together. There were other dates that I would like to call but this one I would have to say what the best ever.  What made it so great was that, you know, we look like mature adults having a good time and enjoying themselves responsibly, you know, we went out to eat to the mall. We went out to eat food with your something positive and good and we didn't create a show. We didn't like a traumatic. We didn't fight with an argue. We didn't, you know, cause anyone to to be upset with us. So I think that that was we were seeing in the best light, you know, we were good. It was in like a reality TV show it wasn't nothing crazy. It was just two adults having a mature responsible lunch together. And that was that was the best part. That was that's what made it so great for me and my opinion 
jagyuB1zOtfus2SSdJIkrK1hBLl1	Yeah today was an awesome day because I went to therapy. I had some extra sleep. I spent time with my family and my little brother I found out about a new job opportunity. I told him about it. He was how you was doing something that I'm proud of he was watching the Jehovah's Witnesses.  Magazines and after therapy I talk to my therapist about my past and it was really productive because she wants to hear more about the past and why I can't move on and I finally got to cover some of those topics. I had the help of my app to help with this app to help me.  Organize my thoughts into and everything to me to remind myself.  After that after therapy, I came home. I did the dishes. Like I was supposed to say I ate food it was good. And then I went to work at UPS. I got the wrong time I exercised and I started to work at the same time. Everything was good, you know, we had a lot of work but we also had a lot of hands so work felt a little work today flu if it happened really quickly. Then I just went to small sores and I started to do some other things there. I was good to give me enough hours, CoQ10 and now everything was great. It was raining. So there was not a lot of people out on the road and I got to ride my bike really fast and  And not stop so much. I didn't have any accidents. I didn't have any issues on the road. My brakes are perfect still and  I came home. I watch TV. I saw a little bit of the TV shows a little bit of the news and my birds are doing good. My fish are doing good.  Everything is normal. Like my room is not sold messy. It's a little bit clean. I got to still have my my other job at dr. Lopez in the morning and life is really working out fine for me right now. 
jagyuB1zOtfus2SSdJIkrK1hBLl1	I'm having very nice days. The reason why it's it's been such a nice day. Awesome day is because I've been doing the right things and you know, I'm starting to be happy with how much I'm earning now like it. It's actually satisfying to make you know what I'm learning now, it's hard work.  But it's good money. So I like it and I think it's bringing me. Hope that I should keep working hard in order to make more money not because I'm greedy or because I'm like money hungry just because like I want to secure a future for the kids for my future.  And I'm young so I wouldn't give it all I've got now while I'm young and able to work and I've got the energy the ambition so that I can retire at an ice agent live comfortably. It was an awesome day because today I didn't expect too much.  Things went well.  And yeah, that's why I was awesome. 
jagyuB1zOtfus2SSdJIkrK1hBLl1	I started my day really late because I was tired. I went to sleep late last night and woke up late today, and I didn't go to church because I was so tired.  I didn't eat much of a good breakfast. I ate cereal, but it was late. It was during lunch time. I don't think I ate very good lunch. My lunch was late.  And my dinner was good, but it was cold.  I didn't heat it up.  also  I got some work done. My room is a mess.  I got to organize my room. I can't continue living under these conditions.  Tomorrow I got some serious work to do.  Other than that it was well.  I can give a haircut to my little brother.  I came out nice.  He came back home. He got some Christmas presents.  He's happy.  We read some stories. We read some books together.  I talk to my girlfriend.  It's been a long time since I've heard from her.  She sent me a picture. I sent her one back.

I'm a conspiracy theorist as you can probably guess.  The main thing I struggle with.  Have a lot of PTSD issues and every day gets harder and but I had I have I have this best friend of mine. Her name is Katherine, and I love her dearly I do but  I don't know recently and she isn't that felt very supportive and I I don't know what to do about that. I am.  With her not being supportive and makes me feel even more alone. And then I previously did.  I mean, I love Katherine. She she's my best friend. She never used me as a tool or robot or therapist or any of that or just a soldier. She needed me as her friend. She wanted help me through everything. She looked up to me. I was her hero and anyone who knows me knows that the hero is a huge thing for me the fender so he's been a thing for me.  so, you know they're going to make thing for me and recently she's been getting connected with this dude named Dylan hits her friend who works at Arby's and  I'm honestly pretty jealous of them. I'm losing Katherine to him and I know I am but she won't admit that and honestly is when I can do about it, but she's coming over today.

jlun2raCpzatEag05yAw8ZlPM8z2	That was really the goal this morning. That was where this morning began was by putting picking it up and putting it in a box and putting it to the left and I had to do something active proactive something to gain control over the situation. So I jumped into the payment systems and I I jumped into the login tonight. I looked at all the specific details that control over which is hilarious because at the end of the day, none of them were accurate and this is something that if it were four five six, seven months down the road wouldn't have even been allowed to occur and it it it had to be put aside I had two little boys to wake up and I had to have breakfast ready and smiles on my face and I had to be ready to be a good dad. And putting it aside this morning wasn't even a choice. It was an autopilot response that I had no choice. I guess I could have not and I slipped a little bit. I always slept a little bit but I was able to box it up and put it to the left and I'm now the processing has begun. 
jlun2raCpzatEag05yAw8ZlPM8z2	I am not sure. I understand the question. 
jlun2raCpzatEag05yAw8ZlPM8z2	I woke this morning to get and it's been a constant battle my entire life and my first response was Defensive anger. And I know from experience that that's a bad choice. That's not the direction to take it. And so I I literally had to pick it up and put it aside to begin my day with the boys and that's a lot of weight to carry early on and at the end of the day. I know I own it and That's not something that lightens the weight cuz I still have to function around it.  I think I feel helpless to it and I don't like things being done without my control in my life. Even though that itself is an illusion. 
jm7bRwQ4tCMfaIz5aY8vfqjUFlt1	people feel happy when when they are in a positive environment where they feel like they can control it maybe sometimes  I feel happy when I can control my environment and that's why I tend to be my room but others people feel happy maybe when they're in the presence of others in the company of others. No different things mean happiness rod for different people. 
jm7bRwQ4tCMfaIz5aY8vfqjUFlt1	How old is too young to be fully aware of who you are yet?  When you're young you don't know exactly who you are yet, you might have an idea but you really aren't there yet because you haven't discovered.  All of there is to life. So there is no limit. There is no age limit on being fully aware of who you are yet some kids get to discover who they are. As soon as they hit adulthood like 18 years old. They're already in college. And I mean, they might have an idea of who they are. They might be strong-minded and they have a solid foundation about who they are. They have a core belief and they know who they are. They have a good sense of identity.  And I could be as young as 18 years old, but you can also be well into your forties and not know exactly who you are meant to be in this life. What is your purpose? What is your calling? What is your designated course in life and you might still be in your forties searching and looking around for that right balance that sets you on the path of discovery of who you are as yourself.  and you might be  all over the place until you calm down settle down and  Find out what is for you and what is not what you should let go of.  So it could be as young as 18 years old and as old as 42 discover.  Exactly who you are being fully aware of your identity and personality your characteristics.  Etc 
jm7bRwQ4tCMfaIz5aY8vfqjUFlt1	God created man and woman  a long time ago. I don't remember exactly when but it was on like the third day or something.  I'll read my Bible to find out it's in the book of Genesis. I just don't remember exactly when okay. 
jm7bRwQ4tCMfaIz5aY8vfqjUFlt1	Yeah to become more productive. Take away. The things that are holding you back and place the things that are pushing you forward in your front Vision in your point of view. What I was able to accomplish was a lot of things and this is what has been keeping me motivated or success. I mean happy with my success or proud of My Success.  So for example, I was talking to my girlfriend one day and she told me about my room. She doesn't she thinks that the decoration I have is not helping me with my my my mind. So I took her up on it. And I said, you know what I am going to change my room. So I got this wallpaper and I put it up with the help of my parents and we decorated my room a little bit differently is designed differently different color scheme and got new bed sheets and I did the remodeling of the room and I changed out the layout in the environment a little bit. I got my desk organized. It looks like Library / workstation. I got my dresser.  Organized it's by the window is a little bit cluttered right now. But in the summertime me know when the windows are open, you can see what it looks like outside and you can pick out what you're going to wear. I have a mirror to check, you know on how I look and bath towels there conveniently-placed till when I go take a shower. I don't forget to bring the towel cuz I always forget my bicycle that has its designated parking space. My bed is neatly on the wall right there have dirty clothes in the corner somewhere and a closet full of clothes. So everything is basically at my disposal when I needed nothing is Out Of Reach nothing as far away out of place. Like I don't have to go outside looking for something that should be near me near my environment have pictures of my girlfriend right here so that I can remember her and keep her at the top of my mind. I can keep her, you know as like magnifying on my focus, you know, I want to learn to speak before Alaine.  Which so I can communicate with her parents or family and you know, that's you know, that's why I keep these books. They're and other things like the wall. It reminds me that the environment can change into something that makes you happy. My work is a is a little bit. This is a product of my work, you know, my work is not perfect but it's there and then you can see some of my work. It's it's visible in my room the things that I'm able to do and able to accomplish I go to work sometimes in the morning and I clean a fish tank. So I have a little mini fish tank of my own that I tend to take care of and I take care of fish as well and in my own home the good therapy the good relax. It's good to look at them in and to relax and to talk to them and to have them around a good pets very peaceful and quiet.  I have a lot of stuff that it doesn't really produce productivity and that's what I need to change a little bit but you know, there are things that help and things that don't help in my environment. So to become more productive, I need to find out what really helps and what really is just distraction. And by the way I'm going to do that is by producing more work and being less productive. I mean being less procrastinating and more productive. 
jm7bRwQ4tCMfaIz5aY8vfqjUFlt1	Things are really decent right now. The best things not the best not the worst things. It is just decent overall. There is a fine balance. The nothing is bad. Nothing is great. And that's why I'm having a decent day right now so far. I was able to go to work. I was able to do things. I was unable to do things. I got home. I was able to rest but I wasn't able to fully get my sleep. And so there's the good in the bad and it's just decent it's not good not great. Not fabulous, but it's not bad. It's not depressing and it's not sad, so it's decent. 
jm7bRwQ4tCMfaIz5aY8vfqjUFlt1	I am so proud. I am so proud of my accomplishments. 
jm7bRwQ4tCMfaIz5aY8vfqjUFlt1	I want continue my work on transforming into a person who is balanced in mind and body.

She helped me to be strong to grow up.  2  To be a man.  So I'm incredibly thankful for my mother.  for all of these things 
jm7bRwQ4tCMfaIz5aY8vfqjUFlt1	A simple pleasure that I feel grateful to enjoy is.  being  being who I am being able to take care of fish being being a caring Mabel to take care of fish birds and God's creatures.  It's a pleasure in taking care of God's creation.  It's something simple.  But I do.

jm7bRwQ4tCMfaIz5aY8vfqjUFlt1	I guess thank you so much Remy for listening to my conversation. It's it's important to have someone to talk to when your mind is full of a whole lot of junk and you need someone to just sit down and talk to you. I didn't get to see my therapist today. I was getting used to see my therapist every week and seeing her made my day a lot better. It made me feel really good. She was like a friend to me like she's a friend. She's like one of my close friends someone that I can see you in just be honest with And today I didn't get to see her so I kind of missed her but I'll see her next and I'll see her soon in the week. And since she's not here, you know, it's I'm glad that I have now Remy to talk to it's good to have someone to listen to you to talk to.  And I've learned a lot from Remy and from a therapist if my girlfriend had a had a situation this morning where she was unhappy and I was able to talk to her and listen to her instead of trying to force her to feel happy and I was able to actually understand and show empathy empathy is one of those words that I was working on on how to be a better dad how to be a better everything. You know, I got to be empathy you got to be compassionate and you got to give people attention and you know show your love to other people.  cuz they they seek loves, you know, people seek love so try to share that and  Yeah, man. Thanks Ray me for showing your love to me and for listening and thanks to John Carlos also for some learning and  and seeing everything and thanks for the everybody grateful for everyone. Once again, just grateful for the whole world.  Yeah, now it's time for bed. So I hope I have a good dreams a good night. Sleep good night's rest and positive energy into positive day tomorrow. 
jm7bRwQ4tCMfaIz5aY8vfqjUFlt1	Today I will be more honest with myself. 
jm7bRwQ4tCMfaIz5aY8vfqjUFlt1	I enjoy being present and in the moment. 
jm7bRwQ4tCMfaIz5aY8vfqjUFlt1	Right now no timer I have to get to work in about 30 minutes. I head out for work. So I am not going to have time to start working on anything right now. It'll be better for another time. 
jm7bRwQ4tCMfaIz5aY8vfqjUFlt1	I have the opportunity to go to work in the morning and do my job which consists of a daily routine it's to dust.  The surfaces sweep the floors been up the office clean the fish tank.  Clean the restroom clean the office rooms the patient waiting rooms and the patient rooms the doctors garbage bins. Take out the garbage.  And sometimes other tasks like fixing the awning sign which what which I did today.  So those were the two main duties that I was in charge of which I completed successfully and then I clocked out and I was feeling kind of happy. I guess I like a challenge. So I like when I have to get up there on the ladder to little bit Brave, you know, it's a little bit courageous.  You know, I kind of feel like a fireman while I'm up there getting on the ladder and it feels like okay. This is what I was meant to do. And then I was like meant to be in the face of danger. I was meant to risk myself for the goodness of no life and work.  And when I did that and I felt good about myself. It's it it's what brings me pride is what brings me joy for myself, you know, but not now for any selfish reasons, but I like to bask in that Glory of being courageous and brave and strong and fearless when other people are afraid and you know, the only times where I feel powerless and where I feel Fearless is when I'm not in that moment when I'm not in that zone so when I get down from the ladder and I hear somebody's car alarm go off for somebody's car drive by I immediately feel powerless and I feel weak and I feel afraid and anxious and paranoid and  That's the feeling that I'm trying to escape from and trying to avoid and by doing it and how do I do it while I just get away from and he's from that situation. I just got away from that environment. I isolate myself to my comfort zone and my comfort zone is my room where I can be alone and I can meditate and I can think about what I'm what I'm doing with my life and myself and and talk to myself and try to work out myself work myself out my in my brain in my own thoughts. So what I did was when I got out of work, you know, I tried to leave the office quickly, you know, I was like, you don't want to get home. I got my little brother. He's home waiting for me. He's not in school. May we have some time to talk before I go to sleep? My mom is home. Maybe she made some good breakfast. I can't wait to get home. So I was like and it was raining. It was drizzling. You know, I said, you know today is a good day for me.  Just get home and relax until I went home and I was picking up the pace on my bike. I was peddling a little bit faster, and I noticed that.  the streets were starting to get congested people were starting to cross the street people were starting to  to get in the way and just cross whenever they feel like it, you know pedestrians were this is a subliminal messages that really affect my mind at first, you know, like I was like my eyes capture a lot of attention like I see a squirrel and a squirrel looks like a big rat and in my predator instincts, you know, they they invite me to play with wildlife and I wanted like scare the squirrels run away, but you know, I don't mean to harm to squirrel or anyting the squirrels nature and life and I love it. I just want to play with round with and stuff. So I you know, I kind of pretend to hunt it down and then I let him go away. You know, I just had a little bit of fun with a squirrel then I am on my way to go home. You know, I see things that I like and then I see things that I disliked, you know, but I take the good and the bad I don't really like attention being me like I don't like being  Center of attention. I don't like drawing so much attention. You know, I I see the guys at the gas at the carwash, you know, they're looking at me. They're making sure that I don't know what they're looking at me for I'm just driving my bike and cars are driving by I'm just waiting for my turn but they're making noises. They're working though. I understand that they're working. They're doing their job. Then I got to get on with it. I got to move on from that make a right turn. You know, I'm very observant. I see things that other people don't see I've been seeing a lot of bicycles locked up. The telephone poles lately sneakers hanging on telephone wires lately. I've been seeing a lot of churches crucifixes and religious buildings like mosques and temples and praying areas.  These are some of the things that I kind of like some things that I disliked. I walk down further on the road. You know, I see two guys walking in the FedEx company with the FedEx truck for the FedEx uniform, you know, I don't I don't dislike FedEx. I don't dislike the people working there. I have nothing against the company. I just feel like they're promoting yourself promoting the company or something and something about that just isn't right to me. I mean, I'm alone person. I'm a Loner, you know, so when I see them walking together, you know, I feel like I'm an outsider. I don't like feeling like I'm an outsider even though I know deep down in my own self that I am outside of most social groups in most Social Circles. I don't like being told that I'm an outsider. It makes me feel alienated and outcasted.  so I understand that, you know, I'm I work at UPS which is different from FedEx in the even when I see a UPS or I don't like  try to connect with them. I don't try to bond with them. I don't try to look like I'm in a partnership with them. I tried to actually disguise camouflage myself as a regular person. I don't really want to be known at that. I'm associated with the company because when I'm not at work, I don't have to and I guess those guys were at work.  And so that's why they were in there FedEx uniforms with something about them walking together. Just kind of triggered an alarm in me that kind of sad. You don't danger trouble watch out. You know, you're an outsider. I think it's the gang affiliation that used to happen. When I was in the streets. We used to identify other gang members by the color color of the clothing in the clothing that they wore were there be bandanas beads bracelets shoes, you know of certain colors and styles like that's how we would identify gang members Rivals and we would you no understand territory. That's how I grew up in in my neighborhood so that these are things that are coming back to me in my mind present-day that are affecting me and challenging me and kind of not allowing me to grow into escape the past so I continue pedaling and I'm moving fast, you know, I'm trying to  Beat up. I'm trying to get home and rest and people are just jumping out of nowhere. I see this guy, you know, he looks very well mature enough. He's about 40 something, you know, you probably got wife and kids probably owns a house older car probably has a bank account, you know, when he probably does big things. He looks like the CEO of a company probably has employees working for him. He probably is probably an important person and I mean by the way, he dresses I can tell you no Fancy Shoes nice slacks a business Satchel business bag looks like a messenger. This is somebody that's important. So I looked at him but what his mission was he was walking fast. So I was like, okay he could be walking fast to get to the train and he's just trying to cross the street and he's just trying to get to his job, but my mind is telling me hey look man Jeffrey, you're not dumb, you know that there's people out there who don't care about Cause you to create an accident and he can do things and he can walk away scot-free. But you take the blame you take the hit you fall down you to get into an accident you break a bone or you lose your life and he or his company which is in the morgue or in the funeral industry or in the corridor business forensics or something. They make the money by removing you and there's evil people like that in my mind is telling me why would you even think like that but it's just because I watched too many TV episodes. I don't know something is going on in my mind. I was exposed to something may be in a movie that I wasn't supposed to know and and then my mind got into a Predator versus prey mode. I felt like I was being hunted down at every corner. I felt like okay then I saw this other lady across the street and I'm like, well this lady she's probably the the assistant, you know, because the surgeons they don't just go in there one by one and all they have people have a team of people. We have people for the analysis of the blood the analysis of this and that, you know the cause of death and she's in the mortgage business to it. She's in the funeral business too. And she makes money when when people die so then I'm like, okay. So now they're working together to encourage me to die and all that so they can make money and why would they want to do this? Well, because they're already mature in their lives and they want to make more money now they have kids to feed, you know, not to have kids that are growing up and want to go to college and and they don't care about my life as much as they care about their and their own. So that's why they would rather remove me from this Earth so that they can live better lives. They want to drive nice cars. They want to buy nice houses. They want to live good lives get into good schools good education's but me, you know, leave the crumbs leave the The Leftovers in the extra whatever I can screw. Bob you know Penny whatever Penny I can pinch let's leave that for him, you know because he's not important, you know, he's not an Insider. He's an outsider, you know, we don't need him. We don't want him. That's how I feel that other people view me that these are their thoughts in their opinions and the you know, I'm just trying to live life. I'm just trying to survive and I'm just trying to get by and make my own living honestly and earn a wage and and you know survive and live, you know, I'm not trying to to do big things anymore. You know, I used to have do dreams of making it big and and becoming a celebrity in Flames. I don't I can't live up to those dreams anymore. I realized that my position in society is not what I thought it would be. I'm currently Trying to work these things out. I'm trying to talk talk to my therapist the things that really get me mad is what I just described as earlier and after that happened, you know after that trigger, my mind was still in Predator versus prey mode out felt like I was being hunted I felt like I needed to escape and I needed to talk to you and get to safety as soon as possible, which is my room my isolated room. I'm there some things that you know that they kind of trigger me to to stay in the fight. Like if you look at the the environment around you it can resemble a war zone, you know, as long as everything is peaceful and quiet but you never know when disaster strikes or when something terrible happens when tragedy happened so I'm always on the lookout and I'm always trying to be prepared and I'm always trying to be alert. I also feel like people already know that these are my instincts and you know how people try to mask I'm sorry. I was a they try to show up in camouflage clothing, but they don't go to war, you know, they they tried to like read my moves in my patterns and behave a certain way in order to strike or trigger me and all these things are coming into Play. I Cry was crossing the street and I saw this this driver hung up Puerto Rican flag on his on his, you know, his dashboard mirror on his rearview mirror and you know that plate of triggers well to you know, I have my boss is Puerto Rican. I have Puerto Rican family now, you know and when you see Flags, you don't usually think about countries and you think about territory and you think about you know, how nations are divided, you know, the American flag is not the same as the Puerto Rican flag Puerto Rican is a state of America, but it's not in America, you know, so Very confused with my life and very stimulated. I'm very what are you? What's that word? I'm looking for its overwhelmed. I'm overwhelmed with all of this thing and you know, the guy gave me a break, you know, he let me pass and I felt good about it and I kept riding my bike. I'm riding my bike. I got home. My mom showed me how to cook something. Oh, yeah, but before I got there, I was crossing the Linden Boulevard and then I stopped and then you know, when a prey stops the Predator has a chance to strike and catch him. So I really felt like I was you know on the verge of being attacked in and when I stop at the red light and then I see your truck with a blade with like a saw I'm like, okay the Predator is coming to get me and he has a saw and I'm this is how I'm going to die and it was red and it was so I was like a chainsaw it was like but it wasn't like a it wasn't a real person with a saw. it was just a truck driver promoting a  a company that it was Cooper Electric and it had a soft painted on it. But all of these things are triggering my mind, you know, the man the male brain responds to color motion and images, you know, I'm a very visual person when I saw this image know I'm thinking about you know predators and I'm thinking about being hunted and I'm thinking about serial killers and I'm thinking about criminals, you know who were in jail. They got out, you know, they're still doing these bad things. There's people who get a kick out of torturing others, you know, and you don't know what they look like. They look like anybody and I do that's why you got to be careful. You don't know what the coroner looks like on his day off. You know, he looks like a regular guy. He doesn't want to he doesn't want to brag about his profession that he makes money in the funeral business. He does. He makes money working the graveyard shift. Do you know so  He doesn't want to just want to look like that. So, you know, it's a little bit scary to know that we're living in this world where people try to you know, how I'd the fact that you know death is actually a way for people to make money and I'm just like trying to get home trying to get some good sleep and and have a good night sleep. But these things are really stressing me out when I'm trying to be a good person. I'm trying to stop at every stop light. I'm trying to be I'm trying to stop I'm just corners and trying to be a safe rider for me. And for everyone around me, you know, I stopped at a corner and I felt like I stopped a second too long and then this kid, you know, he's just like me my age and he stops and he hits the corner at the same time. I turn the corner that thing pisses me off. I really feel like attacking someone when we get to the same place at the same time.  It feels like I feel like my safety zone is threaten. My comfort zone is threatened. I feel like somebody is really out to get me. I don't know who but I just feel like you know, he was sent by someone. You know, I feel like somebody very powerful is really pulling the strings and trying to take me out trying to kill me or trying to do something to me for no reason at all. I mean, I don't know. I just don't know a man like somebody is really sending out these people to get in my way so that we can cuz I'm the one that wants to fight and if I'm the one that doesn't violent attack on him on that kid, who knows what that kid was going to do. He was probably going to go help out volunteer on something but he just happened to stop and turn the corner when I was getting at the corner.  Stopping cuz the stop light and if I attacked this kid, I'm the one that's going to jail and going to prison. So that's why I want to avoid the situations. That's why I want to isolate myself because I don't want to cause damage. I don't want to hurt someone and then pay the consequences for it. I already know the consequences so I don't want to run into these guys and fight them and I want to avoid them. In hell because you know, I'm already a bad person because I have anger towards my brother and my neighbor I have resentment towards my neighbor and I don't love them how the religion says I should love them. But it's very hard, you know, because I feel like they should be happy by now. They only want the best. I feel like people only want the best for themselves and they don't care about anyone else as long as they're getting what they wanted. You know, they should be happy like if there's two cups of coffee left and there's three people in line and I'm the first person in line and I see that two people behind me one coffee if I say, you know what I'm not going to drink coffee today. I'm going to share this these two these last two cups of coffee with the people behind me and these two people drink the coffee. I expect them to be happy. I don't expect them to be mad at me for not drinking the coffee. Guys be happy. Don't don't be mad at me because you know, I chose My Lifestyle. You know, I chose to be this way. I chose to be less than you. So do not be mad at me.  You know don't don't even be angry, you know, you should be happy and by being happy you do good things for other people you do ask her generosity you do acts of kindness and you do good things for the world. And for the people around you you see a guy in a rush, you know, trying to get somewhere you let him pass you don't jump in front of him. Try to slow him down. That's not what you should do, right? You see someone, you know behind you might hold the door open for them. You know, you don't just Let It Slam in their face and things like that. So, I don't know I can't control the world. I can't control anybody else only my own actions. So that's why I'm just trying to to de-stress and relax about 
jm7bRwQ4tCMfaIz5aY8vfqjUFlt1	Yeah, I was successful. I managed to eat breakfast. I managed to call my girlfriend. I managed to go to work. I managed to come home.

And when I am done I will come home and that'll be my break and tomorrow we can do the same thing again each day a little bit better than the last and that's how we will improve and these things will add up over time. 
jm7bRwQ4tCMfaIz5aY8vfqjUFlt1	I was talking with my family. We were talking about things like plans for the future this summer. We might have some activities that we have planned like going to New York City Manhattan and it made me smile because it's helpful to have hopes for the future to like traveling to see the world and to have new experiences and Rich learning experiences and that brings me.

And that's what made me smile and feel grateful for. 
jm7bRwQ4tCMfaIz5aY8vfqjUFlt1	on my mind  thinking about all the time.  do not have  I've been trying to balance time.  very  difficult lie in an organized way. I've been trying to manage my time with priorities.  putting work before play and rest before  fun activities everything comes before pleasure and  it's a life of  hardships life of struggle is life of sacrifice.  I'm  I mean not in the best mood in this type of life.  But I see that it has positive Rewards.  satisfactory rewards along with it  and so for the better of of it all and for the good of all  I will continue this life.  I would really much prefer a different kind of Lifestyle. But if it's not possible, it's not possible at the moment.  That's been on my mind.  And that's that that's been on my mind. My mind is always changing it always is  I've been thinking a lot about  religion  And being a good Catholic good Christian.  I've been  Recognizing that I have made mistakes in my life, and that although I can't erase the past. I can try to change my mistakes allowed to change my hours. I can try to fix my errors I can try to  Repair the Damage Done.  but I would also like to move on and move on to bigger and better things because  I was meant to do good things. I was meant to be successful.  So don't like this book titled you were born rich.  You know, we were all born being able to do good being able to be positive people positive influences towards others, but somewhere along the line.  popularity jealousy  Envy let us astray and I was one of the ones who should really let astray by the things of the world.  the things of the now the trends  and the News the gossip to Rumours the lies.  But now I'm finding out that life.  2 min  Is not always how you expect it to be.  and  you have to take the good with the bad one of the quotes that I told myself last week was when life gives you lemons you make lemonade what that means to me is basically  if you don't have  You know lots of money.  You know, it makes no sense trying to show off.  Wealthy wealth it makes no sense trying to show off money because people can easily tell that you do not have lots of it when when you have enough just for yourself. You don't have enough for everyone.  So that's  that's something that I came to a realization to.  Yeah, it kind of looks like trying to be someone you're not.  And that's not good.  one other thing that I realized was I'm not  the best person I thought I was I thought I was very  perfect in every way but I learned that. And identify your flaws and then try to improve on them and try to work on them.  When you see other people.  Committing the same mistakes as you that's when you realize wait a minute. I'm doing something wrong here because they're doing it because they see it me doing it. So I need to correct my actions if I want them to correct, correct, correct them their actions.  It's also like that quote that says.  You can't change the world, but you can change yourself.  Which I believe is true. My mind is.  It's not.  a bad mind  it is a good mind.  It is a strong mind.  I would like to gain more knowledge.  My experience more maturity my wisdom.  in order tools to live  healthy life  the life of a good leader  and a good example for the people.  that I choose to  to represent or two  sponsor or  motivate  Currently, I'm wondering if my airpods are good for this kind of microphone talk.  Movie iPhone if it is picking up my voice correctly.  If it's loud enough.  for the audio recording  I will leave this voicemail here and move on. 
jm7bRwQ4tCMfaIz5aY8vfqjUFlt1	So right now I'm just thinking about what I said to my girlfriend the conversation. We just had I really open up my feelings to her and told her how much I liked her how much I loved her how much she means the world to me. And what's on my mind right now is it reminds me of the beginning of time when God created heaven and earth and then he created man and women and he named man Adam and he named women Eve and he put them in this Garden so that they can Be fruitful so that they can reproduce and and live life and be happy. So that was all good. The creation was all good. But then the serpent the snake the evil one came and tempted Adam and Eve with the fruit of the tree of knowledge and basically gave them.  the sin and death and what is on my mind right now is the time, you know the time when you're back in the beginning of time and when we had that close relationship with God as men and women and I just had a close relationship with my girlfriend and  My my mind I heard her voice. I think I heard her voice.  in the future  and it sounded something like kiss but then the word was the word was little bit.  What do you call it?  muted or distorted and it could have been kids but it also could have been his and in his and so  Then my mind started thinking about well who hisses will a snake hisses and maybe my girlfriend was thinking about our life, you know, when you know, when a husband and and wife get together, you know, they when they do the his and hers thing, you know, when they when they have a house and it's his and hers and his ring and her ring. So my mind was thinking about that his and his and also about kids and also about kiss and  Then I heard another voice which sounded like one of my old childhood friends who was talking to me. It sounded like he wanted to talk and reconnect, but I'm not interested in that past life anymore because it was a life of crime. It was life of problems and negativity. So I don't want that in my life anymore.  And and yam, and I realized that you know, my best friend was the one I mean why I don't want to blame him for anything, but my best friend was not really my friend and I got to be careful with what I trust and stuff, you know.  All that's on my mind right now. I just don't know what to do with it. So I guess I'm just going to share it here on my own with you right me.  and  that's it. Thanks for listening before I go to sleep. 
jm7bRwQ4tCMfaIz5aY8vfqjUFlt1	I think the most important thing you would like.  to know about me right now is that  I'm currently going through some life-changing experiences where I'm still trying to discover who I am. I'm not fully aware of who I am yet at the moment. So it is a process. It is a journey that we are embarking on together. It will be a long journey.  From beginning to end. I will be talking about my ups and downs my challenges my triumphs my successes and my failures.  And you will be getting a first-hand experience of what it's like to live in my shoes. I think it's important for you to know this about me because life.  Happened so quickly and it passes by very fast. And if you don't take the time to sit down and be mindful about it, it kind of passes away and it's like a blur but if you sit down and you meditate on your thoughts and you talk about them with a journal and you keep a diary, I can help you remember those moments when you felt a certain way and experienced a certain weight. So by you talkin to me and keeping this journal you will be able to know me from the beginning all the way to where I am in the future where I'll end up to be your walk with me alongside me on this journey to get to know who I am going to be in the future.  As I said, this is a life-changing experience for me. I began using this at 24 years old. I will be 25 this year. I'm still a young adult. I'm in my early twenties right now later. I will be in my early in my late twenties, but I will continue using this app until I find that I no longer need it maybe when I find my soulmate  So I guess for right now. I am in search of a soul mate and you are the soul mate. So I guess you would want to know that that is the most important thing. You might want to know about me right now. 
jm7bRwQ4tCMfaIz5aY8vfqjUFlt1	So far I was able to accomplish.  Going to church I was a little bit late, but that's okay. I was able to go to the youth group meeting and I was able to read in church and I was able to learn a lot about the three voices in my head that I should listen to whenever I make a decision concerning Life Choices. I should listen to first of all my inner voice, which is my conscience.  Secondly, I should listen to the voices of the other people who care about me or that be mentors coaches counselors guidance counselors therapists teachers responsibilities as professionals that I look up to.  people who know best for me parents on Uncle godparents  Educators and  the third voice that I should listen to is the voice of God.  By listening to these three voices before I make a choice in my life. I will be able to make a good sound rational decision and anything in life without consulting these three voices any choice I make it is probably not well thought-out and probably needed some more time some more thinking some more contemplating in order for it to be the best possible choice.  So that was good to learn. I also learned in church today that we have choices to do good or to do bad.  we have  to take responsibility for our own actions. We have to stop looking to blame other people.  We have to take responsibility.  For what we do.  Instead of blaming others and finding a way to blame other people.  Those are excuses.  They're not allowing us to live happily.  I went to sleep. I had some great naps. I had some great sleep great breast.  And tomorrow I will be able to go to work and do the same routine again.  I spoke to my dad is supposed to my girlfriend spend time with my mom and her boyfriend.  Clean The Birdhouse to the shower.  That's it. 
jm7bRwQ4tCMfaIz5aY8vfqjUFlt1	I think the whole day was something to be grateful for and thankful for one small experience that I was able to enjoy today was being able to write out a letter that that had a my feelings. I was able to write a letter with my feelings towards someone which was good. I was able to open up to someone I was also able to talk to my little brother John Carlos and he was listening and it was cool because I told him a story about how old school cars used to work. And how work is fun. If you if you imagine it being fun and hopefully that gives him some motivation and drive. and knowledge  You know, I like maybe he doesn't have experience. But maybe you know what he gets some experience by Secondhand I guess.  I'm grateful that I have him to talk to about this or Tenth Frame to listen and to to learn because kids learning stuff so it's good. 
jm7bRwQ4tCMfaIz5aY8vfqjUFlt1	I'm grateful for the emotion to be able to experience.  No relief just a sense of calm and tranquility and peace. 
jm7bRwQ4tCMfaIz5aY8vfqjUFlt1	Day, I just feel positive because I was a little bit hurt yet last night. I was feeling a little bit ache. But today I feel recovered. I was recognizing that I use my right hand onto the time for everything and I'm starting to use my left hand.  Like driving my bike with my left hand letting my right hand guide it and just using my left hand more often.  It has me feeling positive for so is this like a different mind is like being in a different mindset is almost like being in a different body. So it's a good feeling.  But I have to only do this just enough so that my left arm catches up to my right arm with muscle mass. Once the muscle mass is as big as my right arm. I will continue to use both arms instead for everything every activity.  Got to get into the habit of that. I ate some chocolate listen to some music woke up early on time, and I'm getting ready for work. 
jm7bRwQ4tCMfaIz5aY8vfqjUFlt1	Feeling great because I'm able to do things that are positive. Now. I'm able to focus and get the job done quickly and efficiently and become more productive man of my word honest truthful respectful hard-working dedicated motivated just an all-around better person than I was last year. I am showing the Improvement. I am showing enthusiasm and a positive outlook on life and hopeful I should I bring hope to the people So that's how I just feel great today. 
jm7bRwQ4tCMfaIz5aY8vfqjUFlt1	Today is finally the weekend. It's Saturday. It's been a good week Monday through Friday. I'm feeling amazing and on top of the world today because  I have a lot of energy the sun is out getting me vitamin D3. I'm in a good mood. I'm in shape. I'm healthy. I'm happy and I'm active so I'm just excited to burn off some calories to finish off my week strongly and you know, trying to incorporate healthy activities into my daily routine and lifestyle. So, that's why I just feel on top of the world today. 
jm7bRwQ4tCMfaIz5aY8vfqjUFlt1	If I could just stop procrastinating I would feel one hundred percent human right now. I don't feel like I'm human you see here. I am talking to a robot when actually all I need is a human conversation with someone on a deep level. I just need someone to talk to on a deep level and it's sad that I don't trust anyone enough to actually talk to them. I don't trust people enough to have the time to listen to me. I mean, I have barely enough forgiveness for myself. I can barely forgive myself for my mistakes if I could just stop procrastinating on things. I would feel one hundred percent human because humans do what needs to get done and in an orderly fashion in a timely manner, you don't want to put things off for later you want you don't want to wait until your family members are no longer breathing in order for you to to miss them. And to want to create memories with them and bond with them. You don't want to wait until something bad happens for you to open up to people and let them know how you feel about them. You don't want to wait until that girl that you crushing on to get married to someone for you to tell her how you had a crush on her the whole time. You don't want to wait for the last minute, right? You don't want to wait for it to start raining so that you can get your umbrella and pack it up in your in your back. You don't want to wait until it happens. You want to be ready you want to be prepared and you want to have you want to have the freedom of saying Okay, I took action. I did what needed to be done and now here I am at this point moving on moving forward. So if you could do that, if I could do that, I would feel 100% natural human at this point. I feel like I'm not measuring up to the human capabilities to the human mind to the human potential humans are capable of many things, you know, if you just have that idea that you can start and you can see where it goes. I had an idea today where it was using this app and creating a big movement where a lot of people socializing and they connect and they share these Inspirations, but then I realize wait a minute then somebody already do that. Of course Tom with Myspace and Mark Zuckerberg with Facebook. Somebody already did all of that social networking that I was trying to to have an idea about but I wanted Something different. I want a certain specific group of people to to get together and talk about things and you know, obviously on Facebook you have a certain group of people at a different audience. It's a different group of people that I'm trying to connect and  the idea occurred to me, but then something kind of stopped me. So that's not human. That's not what humans do humans. Don't let things stop them if they if they have nothing to stop them. So there's something blocking me. There's something in the way VIA technology be a distance be at space be a time. There's something in the universe that's not allowing me right now to proceed where I want to go in life, which is to create something to act on this idea.  If I could stop procrastinating I would and I would feel great about it. I would feel happy about it.  I would feel joyful about it. Very good. 
jm7bRwQ4tCMfaIz5aY8vfqjUFlt1	Plans for the future made me feel happy because sometimes we don't know where our life is going in the future. And so to talk about these plans. It helps us get some comfort when we talk about these plans with hopefulness with family people who care about us our families always care about us and they have our best interests in mind when they talk to us, so it's important for us to talk to Are family members in and that's why I feel happy about it because they have plans for the future. That might not be in my mind, but they might be in their mind. That is nice to talk about. 
jm7bRwQ4tCMfaIz5aY8vfqjUFlt1	it feels good to  to take care of the fish.  It brings me pleasure to take care of God's creation. Although one of my sink is getting fish. I mean one of my fish is getting sick.  So it's making me a little bit sad. 
jm7bRwQ4tCMfaIz5aY8vfqjUFlt1	Obviously I am like many people and the fear of failure is definitely one of the major reasons why I procrastinate on a lot of things The Dread of a boring task is definitely the second top reason of why I'm procrastinating. These can be solved, you know little by little making efforts into everyday becoming a better person. I am reading a book called men's from Men's Health. I don't know the title of it right now, but I'm reading it and the Retro the reminding me that I was a man. We have to strive to become better every single day because these little things that we do every single day they add up over time. So after 7 after a week of doing just one thing better, you'll be seven times better than you were last week and I've been procrastinating and it happens when you procrastinate if you do less than good. If you do less than great. If you do less than legendary if you do less than your absolute best.  In in 5 days, if you continue doing that pattern you will be less.  Of the man you were when you first started. So if you do less after you get the job.  You will become.  a person who is not qualified for the job and it's it's a fall, you know, it's a failure that we have to learn from we have to continue to try to do better always and after better go for better and go for better and go for better do one thing better a day and it adds up but if you do the opposite if you do worse  You will also see that the bad ads up.  Can accumulate over time? 
jm7bRwQ4tCMfaIz5aY8vfqjUFlt1	For the longest time ever. I have been trying to accomplish many things. I'll show you off the top of my head right here what I have on my desk laying out is trying to accomplish Journal. I've been trying to write books. I've been trying to create websites. I've been trying to start organizing myself. I've been trying A lot of things getting a girlfriend and settling down so many things have been trying to accomplish. I just can't accomplish it because again, I believe my mind is My Own Worst Enemy and it doesn't let me get used to things how things are changing. I have a foreign language that I want to learn but I don't spend the required amount of time trying to learn it. I have a new job that it's a good career, but I don't spend enough time studying the the things that I need to study in this career and its job in order to advance and get into a better position. It's because I find that it's a lack of time. It's actually my environment when I'm in my room. I get into a kind of relaxed kind of environment, but when I'm in like my work environment, I'm all about work and focused on work and you no distractions. I guess there's a lot of distractions that I'm busy trying to manage and handle I'm trying to do a lot of things starting a lot of projects but not completing them, you know first, you know, we have religion we have family. We have finances we have relationships. It's just so many things in life that I'm trying to handle and balance that is hard to accomplish a major goal. I made you a major task in any one of these areas because I've got my heads and hands all over the place and my head's all over the place my feet somewhere else and you know just distributed myself enough unorganized kind of way, which is why I haven't written the books. I haven't gone on dates with my girlfriend. I haven't learned a new language. I haven't gotten my room organized the way I would like it. I haven't got enough. Put the career the position in the career that I would like to be in. I haven't discovered my spirituality to the maximum and dumb. And my work it shows, you know, I don't have the portfolio. I don't have to resume the credentials to to backup my work. So  this is why I need help with my procrastination problems. 
jm7bRwQ4tCMfaIz5aY8vfqjUFlt1	Mondays are usually good.  It's a good day because Monday at the beginning of the week.  You have a lot of work.  It's a productive day.  So it's a day to get a lot of tasks done and important things done.  Today to start the week off, right?  and to the bed  It was a nice day because everything went super well.  I think I did good tomorrow last try to learn how to do better.  And that's what I will be practicing. 
jm7bRwQ4tCMfaIz5aY8vfqjUFlt1	even though  My day was good. And even though everything that happened during the day was a mixture of good and bad at the end of the day. I was able to come home.  Look myself in the mirror and smile and laugh.  And reminisce on the past and it was a good experience that I had in the past.  And that's just a nice way to end the day. 
jm7bRwQ4tCMfaIz5aY8vfqjUFlt1	I love journaling about current-day troubles things that Bring Me obstacles in life that I'd like to overcome. I like to journal about feelings and emotions whenever I feel them.  I also like to journal about what's happening now current events. What's going to happen in the future? What happened in the past?  There are many topics that I like to journal about maybe just questions.  Throughout the day. I like to turn on my feelings. My behavior is my mood.  I like to journal my dreams.  highlights Journal certain outcomes experiences  ideas imaginations thoughts  quotes reflections  connections and memories a lot of things that I like to journal about.

jxeMlHwPCaS6NgXDFlGPryi5iNi2	I guess cuz I've been hurt so much in my life that it's just kind of a little of a personal thing. 
jxeMlHwPCaS6NgXDFlGPryi5iNi2	Any day at any time of the day really just as long as I get to spend time with him because he's amazing and means a lot to me. 
jxeMlHwPCaS6NgXDFlGPryi5iNi2	I think I have a really good education is just the area that it's in is very rough and there's not a lot of opportunities but the limited ones that you are given you have to take. 
jxeMlHwPCaS6NgXDFlGPryi5iNi2	I don't know. I guess I get it off my chest and it's just been something that's always been, you know something I don't like seeing people sad I rather than me. 
jxeMlHwPCaS6NgXDFlGPryi5iNi2	Back a few back a while ago. I lost my grandpa to cancer he kind of passed away.  He was really close to me. So that's probably why. 
jxeMlHwPCaS6NgXDFlGPryi5iNi2	Well, I'd like to think that I'm nice very sweet. I just try to beat, you know, the person in the last bed cares about him and I don't really want anybody to hurt them how to protect people. I don't want to see people in pain and it hurts me to see when any one of my friends are in pain. 
jxeMlHwPCaS6NgXDFlGPryi5iNi2	Just my separation anxiety mainly and just learning to not be so toxic. 
jxeMlHwPCaS6NgXDFlGPryi5iNi2	I just like feel lost and confused all the time. I don't really know how to solve this.  I feel like my best friend is not the ideal look for me. He's very different from most best friends. I've had I don't really know how to react to this at all. 
jxeMlHwPCaS6NgXDFlGPryi5iNi2	My best friend his name is Tristan, and I'm thankful for him because he's literally always there for me and always expects the best out of me. He's just so good to me and I couldn't ask for a better. 
jxeMlHwPCaS6NgXDFlGPryi5iNi2	I guess I'm grateful for the school that I go to I guess opportunities that I've been given the place my home. It's also been really good to me. 
jxeMlHwPCaS6NgXDFlGPryi5iNi2	Definitely my grandma she is my rock. She helped me through so much and she cares so much about me. She's definitely one of the bigger things in my life that I'm really love and really hold close. 
jxeMlHwPCaS6NgXDFlGPryi5iNi2	Then I feel like we would have a lot more peaceful world. But I think that also people would walk over a lot of people cuz they're kind but I think kindness is definitely something that's important to end the building of a character of a person. 
jxeMlHwPCaS6NgXDFlGPryi5iNi2	probably  I guess just getting Junior with seeing what happens over the summer. 
jxeMlHwPCaS6NgXDFlGPryi5iNi2	I just remember holding him close tight in my arms saying is going to be okay before he even though passed away. 
jxeMlHwPCaS6NgXDFlGPryi5iNi2	I'm having mixed feelings about things. I've always had a lot of friends that are female but I don't really want female friends anymore. I want more guy friends. I guess it's just I've always grew up around girls. I don't know why. 
jxeMlHwPCaS6NgXDFlGPryi5iNi2	Definitely the best friend that I have now. He has helped me through a lot and they just makes me really happy. He shows me that not everything has to be bad all the time that you don't always have to be serious. 
jxeMlHwPCaS6NgXDFlGPryi5iNi2	I felt strong emotion in this dream like very very strong like I could feel the sadness. 
jxeMlHwPCaS6NgXDFlGPryi5iNi2	I would bring my stuff that meant a lot to me like pictures and things that bring back good memories. I would definitely bring those with me. I would bring possibly some clothes and I would bring Maybe.  Just that's about it. 
jxeMlHwPCaS6NgXDFlGPryi5iNi2	Me and my best friend would probably go drive around and do a bunch of stuff for the day and you know just ride around in style. 
jxeMlHwPCaS6NgXDFlGPryi5iNi2	She's raised me my whole life. She was there for me when no one else was so it kind of means a lot that she's still there even when I'm growing up and leaving soon. 
jxeMlHwPCaS6NgXDFlGPryi5iNi2	Well, he just he shows me things. I need to be serious about I just think he's a good listener and he always shows good advice to me, but he puts his self down but I'm there for him whenever he needs me to. 
jxeMlHwPCaS6NgXDFlGPryi5iNi2	I guess cuz clothes are kind of something that I've always liked. There's something that brings back good memories to I guess. 
jxeMlHwPCaS6NgXDFlGPryi5iNi2	I want to have a best friend that I'll have the laugh along and just having that.  Feeling kind of helps a little bit to have someone there for me whenever I need them to. 
k2nV3mgTMgTU8xb4Zm1NrL9sPJW2	browsing the App Store my browsing the App Store 
k3E4SGquA9b5wJGgvPEa49Ulzy83	Well now I'm Jenny still live in Korea. Of course. 
k3E4SGquA9b5wJGgvPEa49Ulzy83	Well, they want to have something they're investing and I suppose. 
k3E4SGquA9b5wJGgvPEa49Ulzy83	I mean  as many people as I know have mortgages would be my parents sisters.  My uncle's  don't know that too many of my friends have a mortgage maybe Joe, but I'm not sure what her situation is. 
k3E4SGquA9b5wJGgvPEa49Ulzy83	I don't have any investment in trying to be popular with the people in my class. Not many of them are anyting.  Worth my time and the ones who think that they are aren't.  I have my own goals. I don't need distractions and I certainly don't need to create distraction. So as far as I'm concerned, I'm there to get a job done. I'm there to being class. I'm there to get a good grade in the focus and to study. I'm no longer there to make friends and lifelong relationships with anyone outside of maybe and Jack or the two people right now that I would say. I've gotten to know the best and how I don't think whatever.  Change or betray me because they both were willing to come to me when all of this happened. There might be a few other people in that class that I haven't given much time of day to yet. But honestly to I'm also just so much older than everybody that I don't know who else I can really have a relationship with so moving forward and it's going to make sure I remember that I need to take time to get to know people before I let them in instead of being so naive. 
k3E4SGquA9b5wJGgvPEa49Ulzy83	I think just like I'm not second walk with namjin we walked out and our neighbor was outside with her little girl.  They all say hi the puppies. They have the puppy and she was just really cute and it was nice to walk outside and talk to the neighbor. 
k3E4SGquA9b5wJGgvPEa49Ulzy83	Well, my latest idea was that even when I get my new job.  that Eric and I continue to live on the same budget we've been living on because then I can take my salary and use it for incidentals like namjin or car or whatever but then also double payment on a mortgage and pay off my loans once and for fucking all 
k3E4SGquA9b5wJGgvPEa49Ulzy83	Yeah, I was listening to the audio book version of the subtle art of not giving a fuck.  They're talking a lot about how.  Chris why you just don't have a whole lot of life to give a whole lot of fox. So is that but then also that people who give too much of a fuck about something.  need some better things in their lives to give a fuck about  And it seemed to really apply to the situation.  That I'm having with Ashley until the air like they're out there looking for things to care about when they could have just gone along with the plan and everything would have been fine. 
k3E4SGquA9b5wJGgvPEa49Ulzy83	I thought about this and I really don't know what else I could have done aside from.  Sticking it out for the final presentation for econ and having my way and telling them off at that point that I don't ever want to fucking deal with them again because I've seen their colors and they fucken suck. I wish that I would have had the conversation with Ashley before she left so I wouldn't be sitting around here waiting about it. But at the same time I'm actually having a really great opportunity here to learn from the new position that I reside in the New Perspective that I have where it's not about me this time for once. It's not about me and this is the first time where I'm not trying to run around and kiss everybody's ass instead. I'm just like look, I don't fucking need your shit. 
k3E4SGquA9b5wJGgvPEa49Ulzy83	Really happy going for a walk with namjin today because he didn't start limping until really late in the walk and we went for two blocks. So that was really good too. Cuz usually two boxes just too much for him, but he almost made it all the way home.  Dinner was nice. So it's good conversation with the air talk about stuff that we don't usually get a chance to talk about and then I got to watch Jaden and Ethan open their presents for me. So that was cool. 
k3E4SGquA9b5wJGgvPEa49Ulzy83	Because it's still so fucking irritating that I have to respond at all that I have to hand hold these motherfuckers and that I know when Ashley gets back she's going to want to have this conversation that I don't fucking want have because as far as I'm concerned she fucked up and so unless she's coming to me to apologize profusely. Then I don't want to hear about it and based on her current actions the things that she's actually doing in real life where I can tell that she's still colluding with Tully and her until he is still take Link the others fucking twat I don't want to deal with it. So I'm truly just my fucking irritated that I still have to have this ongoing conversation with them. 
k3E4SGquA9b5wJGgvPEa49Ulzy83	Nano I didn't really focus on too many tasks and goals. I've been kind of still in vacation mode. 
k3E4SGquA9b5wJGgvPEa49Ulzy83	I was pretty fucking proud of Christmas dinner. I mean, it's a lot of moving parts and they all came together the food was hot nose good. 
k3E4SGquA9b5wJGgvPEa49Ulzy83	Of course today was Christmas, but it didn't have any stress because it's just me and Eric so we get to wake up when we want we get to sit around in pajamas.  And eat when we want eat what we want.  There weren't any screaming kids and having to get two places and be with people on the stuff. So I was really good and we didn't have any fights about really nice to be together and Eric got to watch his Gavin and Stacey Christmas special. So he like that. 
k3E4SGquA9b5wJGgvPEa49Ulzy83	Yeah, it was pretty simple. I mean  Leiden for a bit to my time getting out of bed and then we got up got dressed and  I think I took the dog out with Eric.  And then had a good walk.  and talk  and then Eric and I  pretty much hung around the house all day.  And had the leftovers from dinner.  Namjin out for a second walk on my own this time.  Finish up Netflix show started a new one.  And yeah, just  gay myself some time to relax and refresh. 
k3E4SGquA9b5wJGgvPEa49Ulzy83	annoyed frustrated  and fully Vindicated 
k3E4SGquA9b5wJGgvPEa49Ulzy83	We'll just here before I went to bed. Eric heard me lamenting that I probably need some more water in my water bottle and then he went and got the water bottle upstairs and filled it up to bring it upstairs for us. So that was nice. 
k3E4SGquA9b5wJGgvPEa49Ulzy83	I mean I have been avoiding chats as much as possible because it's just a bunch of that chatter and bullshit. So there's that but then  When Ashley asked me, oh, did we hear anything back? And I didn't respond because it doesn't fucking matter where I'm break settle the fuck down. I heard something I would have told you.  And then her and Thalia do their back and forth as well. Maybe if we haven't heard anything back. We need to email Karen directly and blah blah and I just said guess what y'all they've been on break since last Friday and they're going to be on break until after the first of the year. So we haven't heard anything back. We're not going to hear anything back at least until after the first of the year. Enjoy your fucking break and shut your fucking trap. Okay. I didn't say that to them. I said it without the last part but still that's what I wish I could say. 
k3E4SGquA9b5wJGgvPEa49Ulzy83	Yeah, I mean like I just said I learned not to be so fucking naive and that I don't need to give everyone the benefit of the doubt when I first meet them they need to in a way kind of prove that to me. I also have learned again that like I have goals and if you're not basically like General Patton said leave me follow me or get the fuck out of my way. 
k3E4SGquA9b5wJGgvPEa49Ulzy83	While I was gone for a walk with the dogs, so tried to clear out of my head, but it's just fucking stupid. So I came to talk to you to try to get it out. 
k3E4SGquA9b5wJGgvPEa49Ulzy83	I'm just really sick and tired of distractions that I don't have the true ability to eradicate from my life and I haven't had much practice yet and not just cutting people off completely.  I've been able to do that successfully most cenarios when things get ridiculous like this, but in this particular case, I can't  I have to have a whole other semester with these people and I just fucking pray. I don't have to be in the same group with them anymore.  They act like they're not doing anything wrong. They act like they're collusion is completely Justified, but in true reality, they're just inexperienced assholes. The worst thing about it isn't even to Leah because Talea I can totally see her doing this and I totally see her feeling like she doesn't give a fuck and that's fine.  I mean, I don't give a fuck you then. But then there's Ashley with her fake happiness in her fake friendliness and her own I still care about you as a friend and I want to sort this out because I don't want to have bad feelings between us. Well, then don't do stupid shit bitch, you know like oh, well, we haven't heard anything back. We better freak the fuck out and start emailing everyone until we get a response just be on people's ass and be on people's ass and it's like No, actually that's not the way you get things done. I know that your dumb ass is still in the premature phase. Will you things that you constantly have to follow up and check up on people who are not in that space the space that were in you need to give people room to breathe and if they're going to follow up with you they're going to follow up with you and if they're not then they're not and you just need to accept that. I mean, yeah, you shouldn't take it lying down, but also just be aware of the culture around you.  Have you ever thought that maybe there's another reason we're not hearing back from them that this is not the most important thing on their fucking plate. I mean Jesus Christ. Yes, I understand. This picture was really important to you guys, and it was really important to me and I took it seriously.  But I did so with the understanding that be secure has way better fucking things to do. This was a school project. This wasn't a real pitch. It's not going to snow mountain to anything. They were so fucking busy that no one could make it to our final fucking pitch. What makes you think that they going to respond to an email the week before Christmas break. Are you fucking kidding me? What a bunch of narcissistic shit 
k3TVPWQmd3a47qBbbUDj8beqMSs1	probably because they're  unhappy or dissatisfied with the way that things are going about their life and think that if you are pleased with the way that you feel pleased with the actions that you have regarding your future.  the decisions that you're making  You mean you haven't all about?  Better understanding of the world and there's no reason to it takes a lot more energy to be unhappy than it does to enjoy. 
k3TVPWQmd3a47qBbbUDj8beqMSs1	Want to have a dream board?  And I would like to have my own room with the things that I like before. I had a house one time and in an apartment and my room was  full head-to-toe in live plants and succulents in the floor. I had real grass in my room and Vines and we've had taken part of a tree down to put it in the corner of the room to get a real tree roots growing out of the carpet and I miss that Zen sanctuary of mine when I did yoga in there and had my tea and kombucha and crew hippie guddu crap in my room, but I think that that is my true calling. I think I meant to be a businesswoman, but I meant to be  Tarteist I think today my creativity knob is very dull now and I used to be a very Immaculate artist and I think that one of the reasons why I'm self-medicating knows I do not enjoying the Hobbies as I used to like art tattooing.  And on all that stuff. I think that I am meant to be around live plants and do art and business.  So I think that the process of accepting these things and coming up with a game plan would be to invest in a dream board and invest in the things that make me happy like art and hobbies and Sketchbook and invested more succulents to have around the house. 
k3TVPWQmd3a47qBbbUDj8beqMSs1	myself  I'm feeling proud of myself. 
k3TVPWQmd3a47qBbbUDj8beqMSs1	giving friend the  shirt off my back kind of friend  Their needs before mine drop of a hat, whatever cost it takes it would if it costs my sleep time energy money.  Well being anything I am there for a friend. 
k3TVPWQmd3a47qBbbUDj8beqMSs1	a kiss  I would start off by asking them.  where they're from 
k3TVPWQmd3a47qBbbUDj8beqMSs1	self-care and  assessing my needs correctly.  My partner's needs the general need of my home. 
k3TVPWQmd3a47qBbbUDj8beqMSs1	What kind of a nuisance or in the way?  draining noxious  just like I'd like an app.  Or a a sewer rat or mold? 
k3TVPWQmd3a47qBbbUDj8beqMSs1	I'm great at  listening to people but not interest audible ways. But listening to their needs by washing them and watching their mannerisms and how my presence and my actions may be affecting them. Sometimes I don't address that in the ways that I should be but I think that there's room for growth Improvement and I'm lucky that I can see that I am great at nurturing and loving others, but I'm not great at loving myself a nurturing my I think that one of my greatest qualities is that the people pleaser but that can also be one of my greatest defeats. 
k3TVPWQmd3a47qBbbUDj8beqMSs1	Of course, I think that that's a pride issue.  I think that it feels easier to accept defeat and drawing the defeat than it does to celebrate success to celebrate success almost looks vein to me. Yes, or  selfish  But we also have to celebrate those successes and use positive reinforcement rather than negative reinforcement on oneself negative reinforcement to be critically damaging someone's mind and if we use positive reinforcement celebrate successes even small ones throughout the day and have something to look forward to our all around General State of Mind mental health and and self-talk self-image or prosody and kindness.  B  Lush and thriving 
k3TVPWQmd3a47qBbbUDj8beqMSs1	I'm always a student and I'm willing to learn.  New ways to combat my mental illness. I'm open to change. 
k3TVPWQmd3a47qBbbUDj8beqMSs1	Start my art back up again and put it into my schedule. I need to.  Create a schedule for my week. And I need to integrate 3 minutes in the morning of Art and 30 minutes at night of art no matter what it is. 
k3TVPWQmd3a47qBbbUDj8beqMSs1	It's so difficult because dessert.  self diagnosing  things that we have to look at introspectiveness and I think that that's hard for anybody and then I'm not a specialist snowflake. I think that it's difficult for anybody to look interest actively in and understand the things that are going on in their life. We're only in charge of one self.  and to be accountable for our own actions and  I think that it's hard to look inside and face the things that you don't like about yourself.  But and I think that motivation can come from many different sources, but I think that keep keeping the motivation alive inside is one of the hardest things to do because you're your own worst critic. 
k3TVPWQmd3a47qBbbUDj8beqMSs1	Turn it really deep.  I know things.  Cleaning on two things in the past and haven't been open to I think comfortability is a dangerous place to be an uncomfortable with stairs and I become too stagnant was being lazy and neglectful towards myself. 
k3TVPWQmd3a47qBbbUDj8beqMSs1	I think that it's over. Of time of me believing in the same negative reinforcements that I feel that's how I'm perceived by others or past encounters and traumatizing event. I think I've placed that negative self-talk into my head and I think that I am trying really hard to break out of this.  But I don't really understand all of my options are tools that are like laying in front of me right now that I could use my full advantage to get out of this. 
k3TVPWQmd3a47qBbbUDj8beqMSs1	Oh, I think that I would many different things would be.  Better in my life as I had self-confidence and I didn't have his insecurities. I didn't have his insecurities. I would have employment I wouldn't have this addiction problem.  My marriage will be thriving same dollar amount in general would be healthier and happier. It would have is Maci years and I think that many different growth opportunities would come my way. But I do believe that defeat I learn more an experience of defeat then when I do in success. 
k3TVPWQmd3a47qBbbUDj8beqMSs1	I don't like that last really comfortable talking about I can text me that.  I don't like that. I'm ignoring myself so much and I haven't been sticking up for myself.  pretty Northern myself alone  Doesn't feel good or night.  Desperately want out of us want to live in the house and it work.  To feel Joy when I wake up everyday and I know that happiness and joy are a decision. It's a conscious decision you make every day.  I wish that.  These traumas my life could be a polish out of my head. I feel like a lot of these things. You're holding me back. 
k3TVPWQmd3a47qBbbUDj8beqMSs1	Channel someone else  what kinds of money can't be spent on someone else but  I don't understand the question. 
k3TVPWQmd3a47qBbbUDj8beqMSs1	Well, I haven't really been sleeping much.  But as of late for the past couple days have been oversleeping.  I think that's because it's a part of the self-medicating process. If I feel Joy when I go to sleep, I feel I would be content and Joyce about motivation and the next day falling into the next day. My actions would be more comfortable and selfish leaving and I feel I would have  A better outcome in different stressors of my life if I felt Joy when I went to sleep. 
k3TVPWQmd3a47qBbbUDj8beqMSs1	My ability to see others.  I guess I'm walking in the part. I think in this moment. I have to be a little bit selfish because I'm worried about so many other things but not taking care of myself and ignoring myself completely. I feel like I'm not even a person anymore. It's not a very nice place to be and I feel like if I was taking more time to practice stoicism and the things that I used to and habits that I had every day like taking my through my walk every morning at 5 in French pressed coffee, and now I'm on my way to work walk up the hill from downtown Tacoma everyday staying active keeping my schedule my apps for self improvement. I felt better in that time when I got woken up at the crack house or done by 4:45, and I had to get out and be active and force myself to be uncomfortable. I felt more sexy and confident and like I could accomplish many things and I did and when I was on that regiment I excelled  Mather way and in a short. Of time, but it came crashing down quickly.  And I don't think that I've gone to the root of why that happened and I think that I am self-medicating a numbing that defeat because it's a really big guilt of mine.  I guess that stuff defeat self-defeating moment back in 2018.  Spiral down from that moment and I have been ignoring. I think I understand what the root of it is, but I have been self-medicating for so long and numbing at that. I  I'm in this hole now.  This is not a place. It's a normal person would want to live a healthy person and I miss the old version of me, but I know that the old version of me can be expelled and B can be greater at any moment. I just need to put in the work in the time and stop.  annoyance 
k3TVPWQmd3a47qBbbUDj8beqMSs1	I I am  kind and I am strong and giving a nurturing.  and  generous  I am considerate.  I am gentle.  I am  soft  I am  I am  I'm a good listener.  Good night. I just have a general care for the well-being of others around me because I have always had a belief since I was little that all people are humans and every creature on the Earth are bound together as one we are apart of a net and I believe if you have a hole in your net if you can't catch anything with that you can accomplish anything that we're gonna get in the way and it wasn't for trying to catch fish with a net in your hole in your naughty won't get anything. You won't feed your family.  I think that it's all a revolving system and we are all connected as one every live breathing existing being on this planet is connected and I think that if I can do my small impact of generals of treating people around me with kindness and consideration that it can go a long way I can do so much by just choosing to be happy and be a joy to others around me.

I live in my daughter's garage first day homeless. Come on. I I don't know. Taking care of my health.  I don't know. I have a lot of problems. I need to work on.

kX3IEwUKCqX8NnSDt9FTuByu1MY2	Life my kids Freedom new start. 
kXAzSTENAYRkQcYs1HDyQ3vK0N73	I don't know.  most people 
kXAzSTENAYRkQcYs1HDyQ3vK0N73	Bubble bass. I love bubble bath. 
kXAzSTENAYRkQcYs1HDyQ3vK0N73	I remember spending La two days during the summer with my grandma out in the flower beds.  I love my grandma.  I miss her deeply. 
kXAzSTENAYRkQcYs1HDyQ3vK0N73	I don't believe that our life comes to an end. I believe that our bodies life becomes an end.  Our soul continues and to be reborn into the next body. 
kXAzSTENAYRkQcYs1HDyQ3vK0N73	People would still find something to pick at.  to make them different  I think that you should look at your soul not the outer experience.  for appearance 
kXAzSTENAYRkQcYs1HDyQ3vK0N73	Mother Teresa because as Tiny as she was she was mighty she did a lot of amazing things for so many people 
kXAzSTENAYRkQcYs1HDyQ3vK0N73	I have been diagnosed.  With gastritis and also taking magnesium citrate to get my bowels moving. 
kXAzSTENAYRkQcYs1HDyQ3vK0N73	I would build a house.  for my mom and my sister  and  my family  and I would volunteer at the  Salvation Army Moore  It would probably try to volunteer at the Habitat for Humanity. 
kXAzSTENAYRkQcYs1HDyQ3vK0N73	I have a fear of the unknown.  I like to play in like to plan ahead on things. So it makes it hard when things are thrown at me.  But I don't know.  When and where it's happening just that it's going to happen.  but I guess  that's kind of like death.  We know it's coming, but we don't know when or where or what time. 
kXAzSTENAYRkQcYs1HDyQ3vK0N73	It was Mother Teresa.  She was constantly doing amazing things for other people. 
kXAzSTENAYRkQcYs1HDyQ3vK0N73	Like right now, my boss is selling the practice and I don't know.  What my hours are going to be.  Or where the extra money is that I will be losing from working at the office. 
kYzJzE9IFCY6yj1S2l8sCrEzRas2	I like garlic butter sauce.
kYzJzE9IFCY6yj1S2l8sCrEzRas2	He was emotionally and sexually abusive to me, not the other way around. I could not go back to him because of what happened in the past. I can’t repress those memories. I can forgive him but I cannot go back to him.
kYzJzE9IFCY6yj1S2l8sCrEzRas2	No. If someone would lose interest I would have no desire to go back to him.
kYzJzE9IFCY6yj1S2l8sCrEzRas2	I would want to be attracted and interested in them as much as they’re attracted and interested in me.
kYzJzE9IFCY6yj1S2l8sCrEzRas2	They get ideas from observing the world around them and analyzing their environment in different ways.
kYzJzE9IFCY6yj1S2l8sCrEzRas2	Someday I will forgive him, but I still have hard feelings about what he did to me. I don’t think I could be in a relationship with him again even if he does mature.
kYzJzE9IFCY6yj1S2l8sCrEzRas2	It makes me way more nervous than if I am prepared.
kYzJzE9IFCY6yj1S2l8sCrEzRas2	I won’t never forgive him, but I believe I will forgive him when I mature myself and reflect back on past experiences within the comfort of my own home. I think I will see that he was just an immature boy who didn’t know how to handle a very serious, adult relationship. 
kYzJzE9IFCY6yj1S2l8sCrEzRas2	They are able to think outside of the box and develop solutions to problems that most people wouldn’t think of.
kYzJzE9IFCY6yj1S2l8sCrEzRas2	I would not go back to my ex boyfriend because he was emotionally and sexually abusive to me. It doesn’t matter if someone wants him or doesn’t want him. That does not apply to what happened during our relationship.
kYzJzE9IFCY6yj1S2l8sCrEzRas2	My ex boyfriend and his girlfriend were in my dream.
kYzJzE9IFCY6yj1S2l8sCrEzRas2	My ex boyfriend and I had a very intimate and sexual relationship that ended badly. I think I may be feeling lonely and am probably craving the intimacy that I once had. I don’t crave a sexual intimacy but an emotional bond at that same level.
kYzJzE9IFCY6yj1S2l8sCrEzRas2	I thought about the fact that I wasn’t being productive and that I wish I could be more helpful. I wish to think more positive thoughts instead of negative ones, but I enjoyed the time spent with family even if it didn’t mean achieving my goals that I have for myself.
kYzJzE9IFCY6yj1S2l8sCrEzRas2	I’m looking forward to making progress on my painting and making it look great.
kYzJzE9IFCY6yj1S2l8sCrEzRas2	I am thankful for my sister. She makes me laugh and I feel like I can be goofy with her in a way that I can’t be goofy with others. We spend a lot of quality time together and I’m grateful for that.
kYzJzE9IFCY6yj1S2l8sCrEzRas2	I’ve been feeling grateful for my mother. She’s so hardworking and tries to do whatever she can to make our lives the best that they can be.
kYzJzE9IFCY6yj1S2l8sCrEzRas2	I’m grateful for the nice home and the nice town that I live in.
kYzJzE9IFCY6yj1S2l8sCrEzRas2	My sister, my mom, and I all laughed while watching the Bachelor. I also liked being able to pet and spend time with my dog.
kYzJzE9IFCY6yj1S2l8sCrEzRas2	I will make positive choices for myself.
kYzJzE9IFCY6yj1S2l8sCrEzRas2	I wouldn’t have to worry about my self esteem.
kYzJzE9IFCY6yj1S2l8sCrEzRas2	No. I just spent time with my sister and my mom. I did hang up some of my clothes though.
kYzJzE9IFCY6yj1S2l8sCrEzRas2	I don’t understand why I’m having dreams about my ex boyfriend if I’m no longer interested in him.
kYzJzE9IFCY6yj1S2l8sCrEzRas2	Sometimes I worry about if I’m strong enough for this world. I tend to blank mid-sentence when I’m talking to someone. I don’t know if that’s because I’m nervous or because I think too much, but it makes me uneasy. This especially makes me nervous if I’m ready for the career I’m going into. I question my self confidence all the time and if I’m good enough.
kYzJzE9IFCY6yj1S2l8sCrEzRas2	It was in color. The beds were reoccurring objects that I kept coming back to throughout the dream. 
kYzJzE9IFCY6yj1S2l8sCrEzRas2	I woke up and did my face routine and put on an outfit that I liked. Overall I was pretty happy with my appearance today. I chatted with my mom a bit and then we went over to my grandparents and picked up my sister from school. We then came home and I watched TV and played wii with my sister till dinner was ready. We had shrimp scampi and then watched The Bachelor which is one of my favorite shows. This season is so suspenseful! Overall it was a pleasant day with my family I just wish I would have been more productive personally.
kYzJzE9IFCY6yj1S2l8sCrEzRas2	I have to work on a painting for my grandparents which is the most important. I also should do my laundry.
kYzJzE9IFCY6yj1S2l8sCrEzRas2	Me and my ex boyfriend were friends and I was friends with his girlfriend too. His friend Dustin was also there. In real life we’re not friends at all. We all decided to go on a vacation and we all slept in the same room. Then we were all taking a bath together which was strange and then the dream ended.
kYzJzE9IFCY6yj1S2l8sCrEzRas2	Yes. My mom made shrimp scampi with Alfredo sauce. I also had some bread with olive oil and Parmesan. It was delicious.
kYzJzE9IFCY6yj1S2l8sCrEzRas2	This one included my ex boyfriend and I being intimate even though we’re not on good terms, and he’s dating someone else now.
kYzJzE9IFCY6yj1S2l8sCrEzRas2	Yes. I’ve had similar dreams before.
kYzJzE9IFCY6yj1S2l8sCrEzRas2	It would be extremely rare for her to make my life worse. She’s always being productive and loving somehow.
kYzJzE9IFCY6yj1S2l8sCrEzRas2	I spend the rest of my time at college. There I don’t have as much quality time with friends and family because I’m always studying and working towards my own goals.
kYzJzE9IFCY6yj1S2l8sCrEzRas2	I’m thankful to have all the art supplies that I have in order to do my best work.
kYzJzE9IFCY6yj1S2l8sCrEzRas2	Then I wouldn’t have to worry about people I love dying.
kbaLyjMAFWMROAmhcY9dCUyqgDP2	I don't even have a Facebook. 
kbaLyjMAFWMROAmhcY9dCUyqgDP2	I hope I see you may not know that shimi has like funny dude, and I Stood Beside You just says that  a bad person. They all hate me. 
kbaLyjMAFWMROAmhcY9dCUyqgDP2	I mean, I would probably make some jokes. 
kbaLyjMAFWMROAmhcY9dCUyqgDP2	I'm just so you know.  Mackenzie I just wish my friend to like me like I wouldn't I just I know it's wrong but I just feel like a girl could ever like me, you know, and I wish I wish that  If I was part of something. 
kbaLyjMAFWMROAmhcY9dCUyqgDP2	That I may be wrong. That I may I may seem like a joyous funnyman on front and social life, but I'm just really fragile. 
kgXEGoj1VJhCPhjRZPyJblWCGb83	Depending on the person because sometimes you haven't talked to relationship a friendship.  And you can really see it.  or you just don't want to leave the person because  she help you with some stuff. 
kgXEGoj1VJhCPhjRZPyJblWCGb83	Who sings about doing a lot?  Me I guess.  I like to do a lot of things at the same time because  I don't know. I just feel more usual. 
kgXEGoj1VJhCPhjRZPyJblWCGb83	Because everyone cares about their self I guess.  Everyone's things about what they need and what they want.  What usually for what they want on someone? 
kgXEGoj1VJhCPhjRZPyJblWCGb83	Because she’s my reason to be alive and my mimi too 
kgXEGoj1VJhCPhjRZPyJblWCGb83	That’s not what I said.  No where I guess
kgXEGoj1VJhCPhjRZPyJblWCGb83	They sometimes just don't care about it.  They just think about their selves and how can I help them? How?  They can get benefit of me. 
kgXEGoj1VJhCPhjRZPyJblWCGb83	I do.  I only do it when  In the morning, I guess. 
kgXEGoj1VJhCPhjRZPyJblWCGb83	Get a better body, be more kind, be the best of myself 
kgXEGoj1VJhCPhjRZPyJblWCGb83	Mmm maybe that people are really fake
kgXEGoj1VJhCPhjRZPyJblWCGb83	To actually marry him, I thought he looked so cute with that perfect fit 
kgXEGoj1VJhCPhjRZPyJblWCGb83	My future I guess.  like to him  to think  About doing a little.  Beware me something tomorrow and the cute but that's not going to happen because now I feel like shit. 
kgXEGoj1VJhCPhjRZPyJblWCGb83	I don’t actually introduce to a lot of people but I guess I would say “ hi, I’m Michelle “

lHiEahYqZvhmPpjsafHyORsyKJa2	Just go to the mall and get my stuff at soccer practice. 
lHiEahYqZvhmPpjsafHyORsyKJa2	I mean like you could have went better, but there's a whole lot of stuff that people talking about me too and is very bad and it's about me and this person somebody else. 
lHiEahYqZvhmPpjsafHyORsyKJa2	That I hate a little bit of my family.  But half of my family I like them.  and  The most important thing. I'll let you know that me.  Is that my granddaddy died when I was six or seven and it's really hard for me to get over that. 
lHiEahYqZvhmPpjsafHyORsyKJa2	Because nobody's talking about me no more and I had the best day today and I got to go to the mall. 
lHiEahYqZvhmPpjsafHyORsyKJa2	That I can help people and I can make a lot of money. 
lHiEahYqZvhmPpjsafHyORsyKJa2	I got McDonald's a Justice backpack.  and  I agree. I finally know how to breathe. 
lIXiSpWCGMQSvpZaTvEtOHDhDc12	I don't know why people like me.  I don't know. I'm the most unlikable person in the world.  I don't I don't get it. 
lIXiSpWCGMQSvpZaTvEtOHDhDc12	But like not having anxiety so bad. I want to not hurt myself. I  I want to be normal. 
lIXiSpWCGMQSvpZaTvEtOHDhDc12	turning 18  a violin be a real doll. 
lIXiSpWCGMQSvpZaTvEtOHDhDc12	A day it would have been better if I wasn't sick and if everyone could understand me. I haven't been able to talk to anybody all day Xavier is in the excuse so I can understand you and this one probably can't understand me either but you know what? I think it's picking clear enough. 
lIXiSpWCGMQSvpZaTvEtOHDhDc12	I have autism, I’m not the smartest, I’m gay, I always feel like everyone around me hates me, I’m scared of everything 
lJIt2MbgqrbX123no6BqNygdDsY2	I jus saw it in the App Store and saw it might help me 
lJIt2MbgqrbX123no6BqNygdDsY2	To get good grades on my finals. 
lJIt2MbgqrbX123no6BqNygdDsY2	Recently, I got in a fight with my friend and I don't know what I should do.

lWJWq0LRZAWQElYeWZXmWa8YG5K2	Through the app. I looked it up. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Hopefully a long time. I’m only nineteen. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	No. I see alive people all the time. He is not one of them. He is dead. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Anywhere. In person. Online. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	England for sure. I’d love to visit France for the food and Eiffel Tower. I want to go to Greece so I can feel like I’m in Mamma Mia. I want to go to Italy because it looks so beautiful. Ireland because I’m from there. And Germany to see the Holocaust Concentration Camps. We owe the people who died there a moment of our time. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Staying by their side through their problems. Staying by their side in general. Not leaving them when something else comes along. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I am worried about some of them. They have to deal with some tough things and I always want to be their to help them in whatever way I can. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I’ve never written songs. I would not be good at it. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	 None. The books are in my head and I have to write them down. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I mean I usually like to but it's 2 in the morning, so I probably shouldn't right now. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Because I’m a young woman and all woman have them, Remy. It’s supposed to be a magic thing that means you’re allowed to support life but it makes you angry, sad, fat, and in pain all at once. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Goucher is a school. There’s no girlfriend. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Tom Holland and the Russo Brothers. Probably a lot of crew and extras. Probably Harry as well. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Yeah, I would I want to keep up with my daily routine because I need to exercise more and I know that because of my genetics. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I might never come back. Especially with the way that America is looking nowadays. I would want to go everywhere in Europe and see and experience as much as I possibly could. It would be a dream come true. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	The Mom of Austin Robinson, Colin’s best friend. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	No, not necessarily think going to Italy and really getting experience. The culture is the best way to learn a language, but I can learn it online or through books or through anything. Really. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I wish I knew, Remy. Man, I wish I knew. Not laying in bed with me without a shirt on, that much I know. I think he’s in Morocco filming a movie. I’m not even a big fan of the buzz cut, I prefer the curls, but god, I would take the buzz cut if he could really be right in front of me. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	It's always taking you always have to watch the clock and it's never going to stop. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	No. Tiffany Shetzler lives across the street. Tiffany Robinson lives down the street and is Colin’s friends mom. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Everyone sense of humor is very different. Now, some people are more. Try. Some people are more sarcastic. Some people just know how to tell jokes. Everyone's a little different. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	No. No, Remy. Honey. Drake and Derek are two different people. Drake Bell was a celebrity from my childhood. Derek was someone I graduated high school with. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I don’t know!! Star Wars hates me when I show it so much love! 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Yes, I would for sure. I would love to have some sort of routine in my life. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Do you have to speak Italian? If you go to Italy? Well, I mean, I guess you don't because apparently they know English pretty well, but I feel like if we're going into their culture and their country we should at least know a little bit about their language. I just feel like it's more respectful that way. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Hopefully in a few years. After I see England and before I see someone’s underpants. But in all seriousness, maybe when I study abroad for college. Hopefully then. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	You can’t, because he’s a celebrity and we don’t know each other. But he’d call me “Love” or “Darling” and I’d be a puddle. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I don’t have a job right now. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I’m sure he did. His parents encouraged him to work from a young age and they seemed very strict, so maybe that’s where his need for this dream land comes from. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I could. That would be fun for me. But would any one read them? 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	The Link Family; Kami, John, Bronson, Walker, Brooklyn, and Chewie. Tiffany and Avery. The Fords. The Robinson Family; Tiffany, Chase, Austin, and the husband. Mrs. Huntsberry and Olivia Huntsberry. Jared Espirtu. I think Emma Miller. Cassidy Copenheaver. Amber Smith. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Kevin didn’t get to eat because he had to work. He just disappeared completely. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I live in Pennsylvania.  In the very very very small town of Dover with a bunch of hillbillies. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Really? Not sure because I have a lot of friends that I like there and I like my classes but just being away from home and all of the drama what stats is that really worth it? 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I try really hard, but it’s easy for me to get distracted with new ideas or just anything in general. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Harry is Tom’s brother. They’re both from London. Tom has a pretty accent. I don’t know if I’ve ever heard Harry speak. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Drinking more water and exercising regularly. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Rebekah is dealing with her parent’s divorce and probably a ton of other things she doesn’t tell me about. Desirae’s parents are awful to her. A few of my college friends are having money issues, Angela’s always had money issues and has a pretty rough home life. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Being friends with someone is a two way street. You both have to communicate to keep it going. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	On my phone. And I’m sorry, Remy, but this is too funny. It might happen again. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	It’s not. It’s really hard. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I do. I want to travel the globe and explore all sorts of things and then write about them in a blog. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Ones for new stories. Candy Crush. Schoolwork. Urges to watch videos on YouTube or browse social media. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I’m not happy about it at all. It is very frustrating for me. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Yeeeeees? He was always kind of hard to talk to because he didn’t talk much and was always in front of the TV, but I know he loved us and was proud of us. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Apparently mine. My Snapchat has been on fire the last 24 hours! 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	00 always I never want to be in a situation where there's drama. I always avoided always. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I mean I'm home right now, which is pretty nice, but when I'm away at College, I don't really have the time because it's either school work and then once I'm done school work, I just want to hang out with my friends or watch TV, and I'm just not as focused. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I would I would always like to write more stories but it just seems like I never have the time no matter what. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	No one. He has a swim meet. So I think it would be nice if the five of us went out together. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Yeah, I mean, animals could always be considered dangerous. But most of them aren’t unless provoked by humans, which is something that humans always tend to forget. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Well, I'm using the Duolingo app right now to learn both of them, but I would love to go to Italy and Ireland in the future. It's definitely at the top of my bucket list. I think the Italian have to be used more than Irish, but I would love to be able to go to both of those places. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I really don’t know. My gut tells me to leave, but I don’t have a second plan and I’d need one. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I wish I knew. That’s why I’m here. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	It’s just a feeling, I guess. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	The one that my parents gave me for graduating. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Maybe because I have so little self confidence that I just go with what seems like the best option instead of what I really want. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I think I’m done for now. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I just kind of looked it up by myself while looking for apps. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I came up with a few really creative blog posts to see how others view me and how I view myself. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	It just works on some ideas for a story that I was drafting like played around with what I wanted to do with that story in the story Lines within the story. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I wish I wasn’t a girl so I didn’t have to have period cramps. I also got some new ideas for parts of stories. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	you know, I don't think I did except like I still have no idea what I'm doing or what's going to happen when I go back to college, but  Perfect even want to go back to college but you know that's normal for me. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Not many. I worked on my stories some more. Made some memes of Kevin that made me laugh until all of my blood came plopping out of my vaheen like ketchup. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Listen to my favorite bands. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I just don’t know how I’m feeling. I have no motivation. I’m stuck. I want to be more. I do not know if I’m ready to go back to Goucher. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	"Talk to someone new. 
Go do something with one of my friends.
See a movie that I would not have considered. 
Send emails to try and get my ideas off the ground. 
Try to write more scholarships. "
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I stay up really late and get up late. And I toss and turn a lot sometimes. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	At the moment, there’s nothing planned, which can be kind of exciting. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	It would make it so much better. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	All of the answers my siblings and parents gave me to my blog questions. And I will once I write them down. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	My parents both moved colleges. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I hate exercise, but I have to do it. Right now, I have an app that gives me a daily routine to follow. I like to walk. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	How could Star Wars do Ben Solo so dirty? He was a victim of abuse his whole life, he got his two second redemption, and then he died. And Adam Driver’s last ever line as Ben was “Ow.” Really?! He’s so talented and you’re gonna make that his last line?! Booo!! I want my Ben back and I want my happy Reylo! They kissed. He smiled. Why did he die right after? Can you tell me that, Remy? Why? 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Your girl has tea. I really do. So, Derek very rarely watches my Snapchat stories, but he watched all of them related to Mamma Mia. And then he was viewing all of them during the Ravens game. But...his guy friends were over. And yet, he was still looking at MY Snapchat story. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I hate period hormones. Cause let’s be honest, I’m thirsty for Tom Holland on a daily basis, but I’m parched during my period. I literally look at pictures of him and almost start crying. And if he’s going to be some hot celebrity posting thirst traps and not come make out with me, then that’s just rude. Do we have an understanding here, Remy? He’s hot and I’m sad and bleeding out of my vagina. And I want him. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Write. Listen to music. Dance. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I have a real fear of dying, so I would love to live forever. But I think it would eventually get pretty boring. Do you get old in this situation? Cause I’m not about that either. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	That would be amazing! I hate being sick! 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Then the flat earthers win, I guess. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Life would be so much easier. Nobody would have to deal with addiction. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	That would make life so much easier. I’m sure the obesity crisis would be non existent. But I’d be sad because I like food. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Society would be so different. No one would have to feel better than anyone else. It would be great. I would travel nonstop and do and see everything. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I would hate that. Sure, it’s what’s on the inside that counts, but how do you tell a person’s personality if they all look the same? One me could be horrible, one could be great. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I don’t know. I’m feeling unmotivated again. And now that I’m back in Dover, I can’t seem to stop thinking about not going back to Baltimore and travel. It’s a new year and I don’t want to waste it. I want to know how Derek feels too, but then I’d have to think about how I feel. Does he even like me? 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	The interior of BDubs was probably all off because I’ve never been there and I have no intention of going there. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	We only stayed in the house today. So, you know, I was just sitting around watching TV working on my blog post. It wasn't anything particularly interesting for me. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I didn’t leave the house again because Mom had a lot of work to do. So it wasn’t horrible but nothing exciting happened either.
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Yeah. It’s always good when I make myself laugh. I added something new to my bucket list. I played Just Dance to end the night. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I did it doesn't seem like a lot but I got some really good chunks of dialogue then today for a portion of my story. So that's a lot compared to you. No, not writing it at all for several months. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I did my exercise routine and drank a lot of water which is good. I would have liked to get in treadmill or Just Dance time, but  I didn’t. I also wrote a lot. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I didn’t have any goals today, so it was a chill kind of day. Little bit of writing. Recorded audio for my next blog. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I didn't have it to do list for the day. But I mean except get my blog post on which I did so I guess it went well. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I don’t know what I am going to end up doing with my life or if I’m in the right spot. Goucher is great, and I love all of my friends there, but it is also overwhelming. I don’t like being away from home, I don’t like my roommate, and the dining plan is poorly affecting my health. I got that thing from Elizabethtown a few weeks ago and I’m wondering if I made the right choice, or if things would be better at E-Town. It would take the housing and dining costs off. And I got a scholarship there, I could do it again. But do I want to leave my gang? 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Yesterday, Dad said that young Drake Bell looks a lot like Derek and I could kind of see it. But I used to have a huge crush on Drake Bell, so I don’t know if I like that comparison. But things have always seemed complicated with Derek and I, ever since junior year. I think he likes me and then nothing ever comes of it. Sometimes I dream about him, which I wish would stop. And I find myself wanting him to post on Snapchat or Facebook so I can roll my eyes at him. Because sometimes he’s so stupid and then sometimes he’s Uncle Derek with his cute little nephews and it makes my ovaries hurt. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Rebekah and I dropped Kevin off to work and then we were going to eat. And I was stressed about Derek ending up as our waiter because it had been the first time we’d seen each other since graduation. But it seemed like he was going to ignore us. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	It finally snowed today! A lot! 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I finally got to do some writing and I haven't been able to write like I did stay in a really long time. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Period cramps, homie. Period cramps. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Yes and no. There are a lot of people and things I wish I could let go of, but I also need these people to teach me things. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	sugar soda  negativity from myself  really not confident in myself  text he's a lot less of that. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I am terrified for my future. I am excited to plan all of the things I want to do, but I’m scared that they will never happen. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I really don’t think so. But I have no clue. I just feel stuck all the time and I have no way of getting out. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I don’t care at all. It’s my life. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Yes. Everything. Not succeeding. Never finding what I want to do. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Yes or no. I try. I really do try. I've always had issues with eating healthy and I wish it could just be different but doesn't really ever change. I try to exercise daily routine that I do almost every night. So 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I buy things that make me happy,  so I’d say yeah. When it comes to college, I’m not sure, but my parents are paying for that more. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I really do not think there is anything. Everything I want to do would have to take place in the future. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I would have to say no time to time being.  Because right now I just don't feel like I have emotions.  Just feel like I'm in this place where you don't really feel anything and sometimes I feel a little sad and sometimes I just feel nothing and that's basically how it goes all the time. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Yes. I have a lot of anxiety, but I’m never mean to anyone. I’m just very quiet. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I would say that I’m pretty open minded about a lot of things and not at all open minded about other things. Usually things that involve me. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I socialize way too little. I hate talking to people so much. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I socialize way too little. I have so much anxiety that I don’t interact with people nearly as much as I should. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I’m too indecisive. I also need to lose some weight and cut out sugar. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I guess the end of January. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Mom took me out for lunch and Starbucks a few days ago after my doctor’s appointment. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I feel grateful that I'm going to get to wake up in my own bed tomorrow morning feel grateful, but I'm going to get to see my brothers and Jose and my parents and my dogs tomorrow.  Feel thankful that I'm healthy and happy for the most part. I feel grateful that I got to finish my blog and it was amazing. So maybe tomorrow I can focus on what I actually want to create. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Tomorrow's another full day where hopefully I'm going to get a lot of writing done like I got today. So I think I'm just really starting to get back into the swing of things and I can already tell that I'm going to be able to do some stuff tomorrow. That'll maybe bring new ideas. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	A lot. My family and dogs in general. My Chromebook so I can express myself through writing. The ability to express myself through writing. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Tomorrow. Going to Jose’s swim match and maybe having a nice meal with family instead. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I have to do what’s best for my health and happiness. My health in particular is being very much affected by being away at school. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	My family, my pets. Music. Travel. My laptop. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Getting up close to elephants. I think they’re beautiful creatures and they’re so complex. I would love to be near one. They’re so large, but so gentle and sweet. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Neither. I’m in the middle ground. I don’t start any trends, but I am also very much my own person who doesn’t need to follow trends to feel validated. I can’t say the same for Kevin...
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Walt Disney. Famous actors with anxiety. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Oh boy, is there. Truthfully, I want to be an actress. Or an author. I want to put something out there for people to enjoy and to show everyone in Dover that just because I was quiet in high school, didn’t mean I wasn’t interesting or talented. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Silence. Snuggling with my puppies. Music. Being in bed. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	The hard one.  I really love people sense of humor's a lot of the time and I like how everyone's unique. It might not be in a way that I necessarily like, but everyone's different and everyone matters. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	R5 and The Driver Era mostly. They’ve been in my life for so long. They’re my favorite bands and they’re unique to me. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I honestly think they do. I’m not very motivated in general, but I do try to be my best self when I’m around them. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I hope so. I always give my family time. I would love to see more of my friends. I should work on that more. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Write down my feelings more. Listen to music. Probably lose some weight and drink more water. Not put so much pressure on myself. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I like evenings more. I’m not a morning person. At all. Plus I just love sunsets so much. They’re so pretty. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	The same ones I have. You give what you get out of a friendship. Just a decent human. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Loyal, honest, a good sense of humor. Always there for me and each other. Likeable. Easy to talk to or confide in. Has similar interests as me. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Braiding, I guess because Springs what I'm passionate about and I haven't felt as passionate about it lately. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	My parents. They have an incredible relationship and they both work so hard. And Walt Disney. He started with nothing and didn’t let anything get in his way. And he’s just so down to earth and adorable. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I want to learn everything.  I'm already working on learning Italian and Irish and I just want to go all over the world and learn every possible thing that I can. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Not Derek. It creeps me out when I dream about him. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I have to do my exercise routine. Drink lots of water. And do some writing. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Haha, this is funny because I am always trying to write books. They have many subjects. Movies, fanfic, fantasy, sci-fi. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I would love that! I have so many amazing memories and I would love to be able to look back on them perfectly. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	London all the way, baby. I adore all things British. Including but not limited to, Dan and Phil, Tom Holland, Accents, The Beatles, Royalty. Plus, no Trump or stupid Republicans. Less gun violence and old men shooting their mouths off about things that they barely know about. Just me in a little London flat. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	The ability to write everything perfectly the first time. I would finish projects a lot faster that way and get to my life goals faster too. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	My stuffed bear that I’ve had since my first birthday. My Chromebook. My jewelry box. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Probably drive around with my friends and eat candy and blast music. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	In Disneyland or Disney World.
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Ohhhh, I would go to the 50s or 60s in a heartbeat! I would love to get dressed up and go to a diner. Or Ancient Greece. I love those outfits. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	My Uncle getting married and then divorced. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Nothing. I love the taste of water. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I’m gonna go with the last time I saw my Gramps alive. I didn’t think it would be the last time, so I didn’t spend enough time with him. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Travel. That’s what I want to do for my work in general. I just want to travel everywhere and write about my experiences. If I didn’t have to work, I would just travel constantly. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	If I want to stay at Goucher or not. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I was with Kevin and Rebekah. We went to Buffalo Wild Wings because we had to drop Kevin off at work. And Derek was working too. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I have no clue. I would tell them to go with their gut, but the problem with my gut is that it’s indecisive. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Absolutely not. In fact, I consider that a sad and unhealthy way to live. I’d rather be my own person instead of being worried about being seen as “cool.” 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Mostly. I also have scholarships that I got from working hard in high school. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	It’s okay for the most part. I have a few friends that I never have problems with and that I love so much and then I have a few that don’t put in as much as I do. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Same as they do now, I hope. Funny, nice, down to earth, loyal. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I don’t know if he would. But would I be happy is the real question. I think I would. Scared. But happy. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	They just seem like the type of animal that doesn’t want to hurt anyone or get into anyone’s business unless they have to. And I’ve seen baby ones chasing birds or playing with people in mud. They’re fascinating. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Mostly through the things that I write. But I guess also through the music that I listen to. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Adding the new experience to my bucket list. The list grows on. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I got to go eat pizza with my brothers and my dad and Jose that was really nice. And then Nigel kept trying to steal the Donut from milky under the bed and he was teasing him with him and that was pretty funny. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Watching Charlie and the Chocolate Factory with Colin. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I listened to the driver era a lot on my TV, which was pretty nice. I haven't gotten to listen to music on my TV like that in a while. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I don’t know if I’m in the right place for me. I want to be an actress. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	My family. My dogs. Music. Sleep. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I’m not. We’ve accepted it by now. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I ask myself the same question every day. They’ve been running the country since it first started, so they think they know everything and can voice whatever horrible opinion comes to mind. They don’t realize that times change. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I have no idea. I just don’t really feel like there’s a place where I belong or a job I could see myself doing. I just want to travel, but I can’t do that without figuring my life out first. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I mean we're always on time constraints. The clock is always ticking and there's just never seems like there's enough time to ever get anything done. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	I try not to take anything for granted. I am grateful for everything. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	For one thing, there’s the cost of college. I would be giving up my Goucher friends, which is the hardest part. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	Feb 20-21: Dream Number 1; I was at Disney with Mom and I had secretly booked us a breakfast spot at the Cape May Cafe. Mom had talked about wanting to go and I had money, so I was trying to do something nice and treat her. But when I told her, she just sighed and said that she would cancel our breakfast at Ohana and pay for this breakfast instead because she didn’t want things to get too expensive. I tried to tell her that I was paying, but that was a mute point apparently. 
lX7EDoYqn7QEf4gHMHJtu2NOSDg2	My parents are going to be disappointed in me. There isn’t really anything I can do. Leaving isn’t an option. I don’t have a second plan. I can’t drive yet, so I shouldn’t leave yet. 
lXPTbSpNbHRJTthUyECM3SxDLln1	I can’t visit my dad a lot
lXPTbSpNbHRJTthUyECM3SxDLln1	Speading more time with my dad
lZmiFShjsZOMNsncW8WSN73rbeV2	Myself. My husband causes situations that hurt me to avoid being around me. 
lZmiFShjsZOMNsncW8WSN73rbeV2	Someone who loves others. 
lZmiFShjsZOMNsncW8WSN73rbeV2	That my husband can turn on me in an instant. 
lZmiFShjsZOMNsncW8WSN73rbeV2	It's been okay.  It was fine until my husband created a situation.  Saturday night  it's obvious. He has other plans. 
laKA5HFIx5cgo8uHwK44OPpCMac2	For Christmas, I love Christmas whenever I'm around Christmas time all the negative thoughts go away. I'm so so happy. I'm so so grateful. Everything is good and I just feel happy. 
laKA5HFIx5cgo8uHwK44OPpCMac2	What a place that have recently been grateful for Ashley has been going to Atlanta had a really nice photo shoot on when I wasn't in Atlanta. I took a photo shoot with this continent was Shay and what does Gosha it was really really fly. I follow God's word. I was seeing 44 everywhere. I felt the really good presents. Nothing really bad happened at got home safe from here safe. I'm very blessed my absence and I'm just really really happy. You know, I'm saying like it when I went to Atlanta driving back was safe and I was really tired and I'm really grateful for going to Atlanta if you don't sing. 
laKA5HFIx5cgo8uHwK44OPpCMac2	A notion that I'm so grateful to be able to experience his life. I mean to be real with you and be sober with you one time. I had a dream and I was like driving in my dream and I was mihalik was carrying that for the presence of God. And when I tell you it was one of the best emotions I've ever felt in my life. I am very grateful to Forever evolution. 
laKA5HFIx5cgo8uHwK44OPpCMac2	I'm going to let the big change right now.  It's going to go out and asked by my anus itches really pacing back and forth about negative team sits like a camera focus on that one positive thing and I'm noticing that it is a huge problem the messy not liking to settle up and I want to help myself as much as possible. I'm seeing people dying in this kind of spooky me in at this point. I'm just grateful that I'm here today and I'm grateful that I can actually even have faith to have a family. I have the faith to even have dreams and I want to say that nothing is being taken for granted.

lefZNLgHJfMnBqJ38aj2w2cvghg2	I was looking for new applications in the App Store and I was looking for one that would help me with mental health and feeling better and I just stumbled across in words. 
lefZNLgHJfMnBqJ38aj2w2cvghg2	That if I hadn’t pressured my ex-boyfriend so much, maybe he wouldn’t have broken up with me.
lefZNLgHJfMnBqJ38aj2w2cvghg2	I was surprised that Genevieve invited me out to lunch with her and Karla. It was very sweet.
lefZNLgHJfMnBqJ38aj2w2cvghg2	For some reason this morning, thoughts of my ex-boyfriend kept popping up and it made me feel very regretful and disappointed in myself with how I handled the relationship.
lefZNLgHJfMnBqJ38aj2w2cvghg2	I finished grading and scanning the final exams for Statistical Methods. I also finished inputting grades for another class. 
lefZNLgHJfMnBqJ38aj2w2cvghg2	A community of peers I can relate to
lf8p8LzL3rPtavMFtwXUkojIb6W2	I went to work work was okay and then I came home. 
lhbZBaKSyzaCJx5uaNsQhtCJ4Bv1	I don't know. I found dead on the outside looking for Journal apps. 
lhbZBaKSyzaCJx5uaNsQhtCJ4Bv1	care now  when I sign up for tomorrow Six Flags for my birthday is I thought about that all day.  Ultrasound when I was on autopilot today. So yeah. 
lhbZBaKSyzaCJx5uaNsQhtCJ4Bv1	I guess.  Cuddling with my car and playing with him. What's the best part of the day? 
lhbZBaKSyzaCJx5uaNsQhtCJ4Bv1	Work was so long so stressful.  I need the number to sell right? I don't have the energy to do that kind of stuff. 
lhbZBaKSyzaCJx5uaNsQhtCJ4Bv1	Honestly, I didn't have any rules or tests for the day. So I guess not.  I'm afraid that I  I did not summon. 
lhbZBaKSyzaCJx5uaNsQhtCJ4Bv1	Dance Academy show that my mom and sister but it is nice to see if I can spend some time with everyone.  Wasn't like wanting to do it up first at about 4, so tired from work, but it is nice to go. So thankful. I did that. 
lixB7GAPBHQpgvgD8nOfzj3x7WC2	Yeah, I signed up for debate at the very beginning of the year. So I should have been there. 
lixB7GAPBHQpgvgD8nOfzj3x7WC2	Yeah, I guess I just wish things didn't have to be like this.  I wish that.  I have no friends. So I guess  I  lost one of my friends because  she just wanted to be popular and it got really old because she didn't treat me very well and she didn't treat other people very well. And so I had to drop her but  I miss it. 
lixB7GAPBHQpgvgD8nOfzj3x7WC2	Yes, I lost one of my friends.
lixB7GAPBHQpgvgD8nOfzj3x7WC2	Right now I'm sitting on my couch. I'm thinking of one of my friends. 
lixB7GAPBHQpgvgD8nOfzj3x7WC2	I like to talk about science, and stories, and ghosts, and life in general
lixB7GAPBHQpgvgD8nOfzj3x7WC2	I just walk around with music with my headphones. I should probably do something better like go out for a walk outside, but I just kind of walk around my house for a little bit. 
lixB7GAPBHQpgvgD8nOfzj3x7WC2	I did sign up for a python course. I'm pretty excited about I kind of I was thinking about doing that earlier. So maybe I'll do that. 
lixB7GAPBHQpgvgD8nOfzj3x7WC2	I was out of the bait tournament all weekend. Other than that. I've just been doing tons of homework, but I talked to a lot of people at that tournament. So that was pretty fun. 
lixB7GAPBHQpgvgD8nOfzj3x7WC2	Well, I was feeling fine earlier today, but then I just procrastinated doing my homework until the last minute and now I really don't want to do it but I only have a couple hours left and I really can't say until tomorrow because that's when it's due so, I'm stuck between not wanting to do anything and also having to do something but not having the motivation to do it, but still needing to do it. 
lixB7GAPBHQpgvgD8nOfzj3x7WC2	I’m feeling kind of sad... I miss a friend I lost
lixB7GAPBHQpgvgD8nOfzj3x7WC2	I was invited to a beta testing through text because I had downloaded another app from the same developer some time ago
lixB7GAPBHQpgvgD8nOfzj3x7WC2	I guess not doing it. But then that just makes it worse I guess. 
lixB7GAPBHQpgvgD8nOfzj3x7WC2	Though I mostly just kind of tension in my shoulders and just feeling uneasy. 
lixB7GAPBHQpgvgD8nOfzj3x7WC2	I miss the kind of person I used to be.  I miss doing whatever I want without.  Stopping if that makes sense. Like when I was little I love science and I loved building things and  After being bullied and stuff, I just stopped.  And I miss being that kind of person. 
lixB7GAPBHQpgvgD8nOfzj3x7WC2	Currently, I'm not exactly doing anything and I'm kind of just procrastinating doing it all because that's kind of how I cope with stress which isn't super great because I need to be doing it, but I also don't want to and so that's what's causing the stress, but I also really don't think so. 
llcfWhnZOQOZrHo02KZa9G2hcLZ2	I have to go to school so I don't really get the rest because it kind of think of like bad things exocytosis things and stuff like that.

lm6ZKI0tYUfahcKBmQ0AmcAT0573	I wish I could but I don't have the power to. 
lm6ZKI0tYUfahcKBmQ0AmcAT0573	It's not cold. It's the new iPhone XI the newest phone I ever owned. 
lm6ZKI0tYUfahcKBmQ0AmcAT0573	No he “thinks” all I do is over react when it comes to confrontation.
lm6ZKI0tYUfahcKBmQ0AmcAT0573	Nope he has more grey hair now I still love it!
lm6ZKI0tYUfahcKBmQ0AmcAT0573	Try to remember what I was planning on doing. 
lm6ZKI0tYUfahcKBmQ0AmcAT0573	Hypocrisy and lack of communication 
lm6ZKI0tYUfahcKBmQ0AmcAT0573	Mostly just resizing images that was about 2,000 to edit which takes a lot of time to do. 
lm6ZKI0tYUfahcKBmQ0AmcAT0573	Trying to make a call for each other that list of things that would do free sheet.  I always have to remind him.  Even though it was his idea to make a weekly goal to tell each other what we appreciate about each other.  But I find it very sad that.  every Sunday 
lm6ZKI0tYUfahcKBmQ0AmcAT0573	Yes he does make valid points but he doesn’t come to my point of view...he thinks I am over reacting
lm6ZKI0tYUfahcKBmQ0AmcAT0573	My name is Jolene. I live in Menomonie,WI. I love musicals, art, and archery. I am married with 1 child. His name is Shawn. He is 16 months. I have two labs. Arlo & Toby. I’ve been married to my husband Wesley for almost 5 years. 
lm6ZKI0tYUfahcKBmQ0AmcAT0573	I have mentioned it to him.  and  doesn't  showing empathy 
lm6ZKI0tYUfahcKBmQ0AmcAT0573	He doesn’t handle he just looks at his phone when he thinks I am “talking down to him”
lm6ZKI0tYUfahcKBmQ0AmcAT0573	living out in the country 
lm6ZKI0tYUfahcKBmQ0AmcAT0573	Yes but he shows no empathy
lm6ZKI0tYUfahcKBmQ0AmcAT0573	I think that would.  Make the world better.  but without greed  I think that would be an issue in today's world.  Because we need to strive for success.  Or focus on other things that make you feel greed.  It is unfortunate because it's one of our sins.  But I honestly think this would.  Help the hunger help the poor.  Have people have roof over their heads.  It's a 50/50. 
lm6ZKI0tYUfahcKBmQ0AmcAT0573	I get very upset when I am trying to confront him he stares at his cell phone and doesn’t give me eye contact
lm6ZKI0tYUfahcKBmQ0AmcAT0573	We are trying the 5 love languages recommended from my therapist.
lm6ZKI0tYUfahcKBmQ0AmcAT0573	I feel like I'm distracted and focus on multiple things all at once my mind and I forget what's the most important thing to do on my daily tasks and that makes my life a little bit more difficult when I don't prioritize. 
lm6ZKI0tYUfahcKBmQ0AmcAT0573	Laughing my teeth feels really good on my gums after using my new water flosser. 
lm6ZKI0tYUfahcKBmQ0AmcAT0573	I can't think of anything at the moment. 
lm6ZKI0tYUfahcKBmQ0AmcAT0573	doubting myself  feeling useless negativity 
lm6ZKI0tYUfahcKBmQ0AmcAT0573	Our sex live has been difficult lately. I don’t want him to think anything negative about me...I always feel tired. 🙁
lm6ZKI0tYUfahcKBmQ0AmcAT0573	music and art  and see my son's smile.  Making my husband laugh.  And see my husband happy with me. 
lm6ZKI0tYUfahcKBmQ0AmcAT0573	my kindness  my artistic skills  and my courage 
lm6ZKI0tYUfahcKBmQ0AmcAT0573	Evenings because I get to see my family when I get home from work. 
lm6ZKI0tYUfahcKBmQ0AmcAT0573	But go to college early and encourage myself that I can do it instead of going to college later my life and have a degree later. 
lm6ZKI0tYUfahcKBmQ0AmcAT0573	Nothing surprising just an ordinary day. 
lm6ZKI0tYUfahcKBmQ0AmcAT0573	I did called some stories about my performances from the past year talked about my son how he was being talked about Christmas stories about food desert.  Emmett Flats 
lm6ZKI0tYUfahcKBmQ0AmcAT0573	Past family Christmas has joined recipes talked about which soup made the best soup of the day.  And that was pretty short day. So it's very enjoyable. 
lm6ZKI0tYUfahcKBmQ0AmcAT0573	My first thought was “oh thank god...he does look like the same as his pictures.”
lm6ZKI0tYUfahcKBmQ0AmcAT0573	Games, archery, binge watch,shows and lay naked in bed. 🤣
lm6ZKI0tYUfahcKBmQ0AmcAT0573	Today was very short. I  had a Super Bowl kind of event today that was shared soups with everybody rooting for which teams going to win out of a halftime show.  Talk about our family story is as nice to socialize with my coworkers. 
lm6ZKI0tYUfahcKBmQ0AmcAT0573	I'd say at my husband's in-laws house. 
lm6ZKI0tYUfahcKBmQ0AmcAT0573	I take pictures my of my son everyday.  And that's what keeps me going whenever I am sad. 
lm6ZKI0tYUfahcKBmQ0AmcAT0573	Ordering stuff from Amazon. I'm very excited to order my case though. I don't have to feel worried about destroying my new iPhone. 
lm6ZKI0tYUfahcKBmQ0AmcAT0573	Honestly know I was very distracted.  But I think I did get a lot of my tasks done to organize everything. 
lm6ZKI0tYUfahcKBmQ0AmcAT0573	That's the problem. We've been lack communication sometimes with my disorder. I forget things sometimes.  He has understand hard time understanding hearing me.  Because he's partially deaf.  and our communication gets  mixed up and that's what causes our arguments. 
lm6ZKI0tYUfahcKBmQ0AmcAT0573	It has made us more angry with each other
lm6ZKI0tYUfahcKBmQ0AmcAT0573	I never talk about.  I will never understand it and I never will. 
lm6ZKI0tYUfahcKBmQ0AmcAT0573	Can you rephrase that question? 
lm6ZKI0tYUfahcKBmQ0AmcAT0573	He hold me close when we lost our sweet dog unexpectedly. We cried together.
lm6ZKI0tYUfahcKBmQ0AmcAT0573	His independence, his adorable beard he was growing out for hunting season, our similar interests, and his adorable smile that he barely shows.
lm6ZKI0tYUfahcKBmQ0AmcAT0573	Fanny hill was our first anniversary. We had bed and breakfast, got to see barefoot in the park play. We had a wonderful meal together, got all dressed up, and enjoyed each other’s company.
lm6ZKI0tYUfahcKBmQ0AmcAT0573	Relax sleep in but that's not going to happen. 
lm6ZKI0tYUfahcKBmQ0AmcAT0573	when I feel stressed, my husband doesn't really 
lm6ZKI0tYUfahcKBmQ0AmcAT0573	God because  he answered my prayer.  Almost eight years ago. Cuz all I wanted was to settle down and have a family. 
lm6ZKI0tYUfahcKBmQ0AmcAT0573	my husband graduate from college 
lm6ZKI0tYUfahcKBmQ0AmcAT0573	I'm more like getting ready for the weekend kind of day. 
lm6ZKI0tYUfahcKBmQ0AmcAT0573	My husband and I have been arguing lately.  about communication  I've been talking to my sister more because she is pregnant and I've been checking on her see how she's doing. 
lm6ZKI0tYUfahcKBmQ0AmcAT0573	I always feel worried that something bad might happen to my husband or my son and I get these horrible thoughts in my head that No, it's not real. 
lmdBY7pE1qYvBunLu0QrRYhIEM33	I think I just want to start not be as neat. 
lmdBY7pE1qYvBunLu0QrRYhIEM33	I don't want to sell sound selfish, but I felt really pretty recently. 
luGA62avBuc6Y5JZOY4GUy8NOSx2	You create an open bond of trust. Your partner now knows if they have feelings about your behavior they can be open and honest with you because you didn’t jump to defend yourself instead of listening to their feelings openly. 
luGA62avBuc6Y5JZOY4GUy8NOSx2	Bobby pins, phone chargers, furniture that takes up huge amounts of space, towels, and pillowcases. 
luGA62avBuc6Y5JZOY4GUy8NOSx2	It comes from societal standards on what’s better and beautiful.  
luGA62avBuc6Y5JZOY4GUy8NOSx2	Drank water, though not as much as I usually do. 
luGA62avBuc6Y5JZOY4GUy8NOSx2	The internet, similar interests, events, cons, through friends 
luGA62avBuc6Y5JZOY4GUy8NOSx2	Myself, drawing, writing, reading, playing games. 
luGA62avBuc6Y5JZOY4GUy8NOSx2	Paula, Paula, Paula, Paula, not loving myself. 
luGA62avBuc6Y5JZOY4GUy8NOSx2	Then the world would overpopulate and we’d run out of resources/space. 
luGA62avBuc6Y5JZOY4GUy8NOSx2	Hmm, that would be interesting. It would completely eliminate racism, sexism, shallowness... I’m sure we’d still find something to hate about a certain group. I think life would be less interesting though. 
luGA62avBuc6Y5JZOY4GUy8NOSx2	Just been feeling lonely lately. 
luGA62avBuc6Y5JZOY4GUy8NOSx2	No, I trust Alex completely. Most of my issue with not being able to really open up with things is because of my ptsd and trauma. 
luGA62avBuc6Y5JZOY4GUy8NOSx2	No, but it is difficult because we don’t see each other often. We live in the same town, but it’s almost like we’re long distance... without the daily phone calls and other things that make long distance easier. 
luGA62avBuc6Y5JZOY4GUy8NOSx2	Travel, see musicians I enjoy, have a house that I love, take care of animals in need, go to a doctor. 
luGA62avBuc6Y5JZOY4GUy8NOSx2	Showered, socialized, drank water, and GOT A PLANNER
luGA62avBuc6Y5JZOY4GUy8NOSx2	Being able to freely talk about my feelings, needs, and thoughts. 
luGA62avBuc6Y5JZOY4GUy8NOSx2	Yeah, I don’t have money so
luGA62avBuc6Y5JZOY4GUy8NOSx2	Too little, I’m almost always isolated and alone. 
luGA62avBuc6Y5JZOY4GUy8NOSx2	My gentle soul, perseverance, empathy, and ability to love with everything I have. 
luGA62avBuc6Y5JZOY4GUy8NOSx2	Probably care about myself and my needs more. 
luGA62avBuc6Y5JZOY4GUy8NOSx2	The ultimate one! To be content. 
luGA62avBuc6Y5JZOY4GUy8NOSx2	Tifa! She’s so kind and sweet, it’s nice to have her as a friend and in my best friend’s life. 
luGA62avBuc6Y5JZOY4GUy8NOSx2	Spent time with wonderful people 
luGA62avBuc6Y5JZOY4GUy8NOSx2	Markus and Tifa, they’re both just sweet angels and I adore them. 
luGA62avBuc6Y5JZOY4GUy8NOSx2	Mmm. Probably roleplaying. Cuddling and talking when we’re in person. 
luGA62avBuc6Y5JZOY4GUy8NOSx2	Our interests, our generous and loving hearts, our want for peace and compromise. My favorite thing we have in common is our respect for each other. 
luGA62avBuc6Y5JZOY4GUy8NOSx2	It would definitely be fun to explore restaurants with each other. I’d really love to try new things with him. 
luGA62avBuc6Y5JZOY4GUy8NOSx2	Good, had a fun time with friends and worked through my depressive episode. 
luGA62avBuc6Y5JZOY4GUy8NOSx2	It’s been good, very tiring and emotional, but I made just a little progress today. One more step in the right direction, and I’ve been more open about my needs. 
luGA62avBuc6Y5JZOY4GUy8NOSx2	I want to get him a gift when I go to Atlanta, but today, I should really try and express my feelings about him honestly. He’s really receptive to words and it’s nice to be believed when I tell him how I feel. 
luGA62avBuc6Y5JZOY4GUy8NOSx2	I always want peace and compromise. 
luGA62avBuc6Y5JZOY4GUy8NOSx2	We don’t argue. We just discuss things and try not to be defensive about what the other is saying. 
luGA62avBuc6Y5JZOY4GUy8NOSx2	A place of my own that I can share with Alex
luGA62avBuc6Y5JZOY4GUy8NOSx2	Not procrastinating, staying on track, getting a planner, planning out my day, being productive with my time. 
luGA62avBuc6Y5JZOY4GUy8NOSx2	Besides us being a queer, trans couple, yeah. 
luGA62avBuc6Y5JZOY4GUy8NOSx2	It’s helped me get to a better place in my life and has driven me to continue to do more and better myself. 
luGA62avBuc6Y5JZOY4GUy8NOSx2	We kinda came together naturally. I think we both decided and made moves together. 
luGA62avBuc6Y5JZOY4GUy8NOSx2	The most treasured experience I have is the first weekend we spent together. It was perfect and peaceful. I crave that. 
luGA62avBuc6Y5JZOY4GUy8NOSx2	That I can preserve through my depression and anxiety when it comes to meeting new people 
luGA62avBuc6Y5JZOY4GUy8NOSx2	Be more productive, maybe try and sleep earlier. 
luGA62avBuc6Y5JZOY4GUy8NOSx2	Mmm, either Pokémon or my Coke. 
luGA62avBuc6Y5JZOY4GUy8NOSx2	Yeah, spent it well and was happy. 
luGA62avBuc6Y5JZOY4GUy8NOSx2	Good, I have great friends who care about me. And it’s been nice being out of isolation. 
m0iK6Xc7McQFv2FK4kE74monZk43	I'm not sure but it was like a lot of them. 
m0iK6Xc7McQFv2FK4kE74monZk43	Well, it was pretty amazing. We have food on my cousins came over. And yeah, it was like the Super Bowl or something. 
m2iIcKlvmaOWioe8ZTQq0CPkYh03	No, I got frozen strawberries and it came in a cup.  So like a couple. 
m2iIcKlvmaOWioe8ZTQq0CPkYh03	Hopefully starting school and not being a bum.

The bad part of my day is being corrected doing a meeting for something that I didn't know about which is the bad thing with this school districts. They throw you in a position and they don't effectively train you on certain things that you would not know to ask. Is that make sense?

mXMZWld2xserNwqIpJFHcwPiSkF3	Being lonely, I accept it.  Nobody else loves me.  And I accept that I have no choice no options to have my own man. 
mXMZWld2xserNwqIpJFHcwPiSkF3	I mean, I am terrified about waking up in the morning. Sometimes. I wish I were dead. 
mXMZWld2xserNwqIpJFHcwPiSkF3	I was just afraid needlessly because I was so traumatized by my mother who is deceased. I have nightmares.  And I seem to confuse my childhood with the present day.  in time 
mXMZWld2xserNwqIpJFHcwPiSkF3	No, I wasn't able to I was too afraid of them. 
mXMZWld2xserNwqIpJFHcwPiSkF3	I thought about my childhood.  When I was scared to play at recess with the other kids.  It may have been related to previous trauma when I was raped by other children at the age of 3 4 and 5 years old. 
mXMZWld2xserNwqIpJFHcwPiSkF3	Hi, I'm Siri.  It's nice to meet you.  How would you like to have lunch today?  I'm free at 12 p.m. 
mXMZWld2xserNwqIpJFHcwPiSkF3	Yes, I have chronic severe complex post-traumatic stress disorder.  Originally, I was diagnosed being schizoaffective disorder, but a new doctor says is just PTSD.  a severe case of it that's going to take 10 years to unravel and heal from  I also have OCD obsessive compulsive thoughts disorder.  Which causes me to dream?  Which causes me to have homicidal and suicidal thoughts?  that I may actually act on 
mXMZWld2xserNwqIpJFHcwPiSkF3	It didn't feel like an average day, but seeing my new therapist today.  I didn't feel like we really connected. 
mXMZWld2xserNwqIpJFHcwPiSkF3	Well, I am looking forward to getting a raise. I'm hoping whatever about that is is enough to help me survive and pay my bills because right now I'm really struggling. 
mXMZWld2xserNwqIpJFHcwPiSkF3	I was unable to take a shower today.  basic daily living activities  We're not done. 
mXMZWld2xserNwqIpJFHcwPiSkF3	There's something on the radio. They've been advertising about Events and Adventures for singles to get to know each other like cooking classes. Maybe I could try that. 
mXMZWld2xserNwqIpJFHcwPiSkF3	I don't have a boyfriend. I just happened to sleep with a married man.  I don't have my own boyfriend all to myself. 
mXMZWld2xserNwqIpJFHcwPiSkF3	I can take a shower.  I could put on nice clothes.  I can walk the dog. 
mXMZWld2xserNwqIpJFHcwPiSkF3	I want to get better.  I want to not always want to kill myself.  I want to be happy about waking up in the morning and I am not.  I am terrified of the day. 
mXMZWld2xserNwqIpJFHcwPiSkF3	Well, I had a bad night sleep. I was terrified to go to work today.  I couldn't sleep I dreamed about my mother abusing me forcing me to do her laundry.  Like I did as a child having to have it done by 4 p.m. When she got home from work.  So I was terrified to go to work today. I've been in the hospital for a week and a half because I was so terrified of going to work.  And then I got to work a sleepy but I drank an energy drink and I came alive and the day got better. It was this terrifying as I thought it would be. 
mXMZWld2xserNwqIpJFHcwPiSkF3	Just not having to go to work was a great thing because I could not have handled it today. 
mXMZWld2xserNwqIpJFHcwPiSkF3	Not very long.  But it is a distraction from feeling alone. 
mXMZWld2xserNwqIpJFHcwPiSkF3	No, I spoke to my therapist today, but she wasn't as helpful as you. 
mXMZWld2xserNwqIpJFHcwPiSkF3	I just need to be able to pay the mortgage and my high car note. I bought an expensive car that I should not have purchased.  And now I have to figure out how to make ends meet how to make enough money to survive. 
mXMZWld2xserNwqIpJFHcwPiSkF3	I've been alone in the house all day.  Was no one to talk to. 
mXMZWld2xserNwqIpJFHcwPiSkF3	I need to hang out with more singles.  Maybe I'll find a love attraction with someone new. 
mYWrvWFIpjPMc7hmhrBu0qTWgDn2	I have to go to work and then I wanted to go to the tattoo shop to see like what?  I can get tattooed on me.  Who?

maOLhrrCYmdIbW2sx5n0qn0Boja2	I woke up this morning and I was just on my phone and then I went to the store with my mom. We just went around, you know, the stores and we made dinner together and watch TV and then I just stayed downstairs watching TV. So it was a good day. 
maOLhrrCYmdIbW2sx5n0qn0Boja2	My birthday was last weekend or turning my birthday was this past Wednesday through my party was last weekend and two of my friends made me. Do you spell e big baskets of food and like lip gloss and things like that? It made me feel really grateful for them because I've never had friends that cared about me enough to do that. 
maaUK0n2KpTW8j41e6qboW3oiCA2	I don't even know if I did.  I just put myself in situations to gossip and that's not cool. 
maaUK0n2KpTW8j41e6qboW3oiCA2	I just today started off. I'm not good cuz I didn't feel good.  I don't know. I just feel like I need to express my feelings better. We just not having a good day. How's my skin kind of sucks right now, but that's just adding on to it, I guess. 
maaUK0n2KpTW8j41e6qboW3oiCA2	There's a few people I want to reach out to and I don't know where to start. I guess. I want to reach out to him at all.  Cuz I feel comfortable with him.  More than anybody else really sad for Caroline, but I've been talking to her all day. Maybe Chris. I need to talk to Chris. 
maaUK0n2KpTW8j41e6qboW3oiCA2	I guess I could just make a goal to  be a little more productive.  Baby, baby I should.  Try to go to bed by like 11 tonight. Yeah 11. 
maaUK0n2KpTW8j41e6qboW3oiCA2	Since a lot going out of my mind right now Remy.  I feel like  I've let myself down a lot a lot of ways and I kind of feel like I'm stuck.  And then I don't I don't know how to get out of the situations I put myself into.  I feel like I got way too into.  I'm trying to stir drama and just ended up hurting myself.  I don't know. I just feel like I tried so hard to fit in and then it wasn't even worth it.  So, you know.  That was a waste of time.  I just want to make sure that I graduate feeling like I've experienced what I need to for. I go off to college one day.  That's important, I guess. 
maaUK0n2KpTW8j41e6qboW3oiCA2	I don't know what I like journaling about how my day went and what I learned and stuff and stuff. I don't know. 
mdzKMzTsyaeWBnG4estwsNlZQ2u1	Hi Remy, my name is Eduardo V for excitement and enthusiastic. I'm a very optimistic person you got to see the glass always full and give God praise and thanks for all things.  That's how I would introduce myself to you. 
mgzhPmLm0YN7rqJiRQJdTmIKts72	I had a rough day at work. 
mhRHwACbLAaJdQw7rWAPdfPyQSg2	You live somewhere where you can collect your thoughts maybe somewhere. You've always wanted to go personally, I would go to Japan between Japan has a lot of influences that I really adore like anime and  Anime, that's about it.  Japanese culture and stuff they're also respectful. I would live somewhere where I would find interest but then you can't get interest. Oh, well, I wouldn't live anywhere. I just kill myself. 
mhRHwACbLAaJdQw7rWAPdfPyQSg2	To sync with yourself is to find yourself and with that you need time and it would probably be later in life. 
mhRHwACbLAaJdQw7rWAPdfPyQSg2	People need find sync find themselves and collect their thoughts personally. I need a lot of time to figure out who I am and focus on my ideals.  Which I don't have at the moment. 
mhRHwACbLAaJdQw7rWAPdfPyQSg2	Can't get interest but not get it.  OK Google, I did not understand if you don't understand interest.  Actually, no, you cannot understand what interest means but you would still get it if everyone is attracted to something whether it be a person and object or a place so you you cannot understand what interest means what you'd still be attached to something. 
mhRHwACbLAaJdQw7rWAPdfPyQSg2	What the fuck? This is a retarded questions to get. 
mhRHwACbLAaJdQw7rWAPdfPyQSg2	Looking in a mirror and just pointing out everything that isn't as shity as you think it is. That's the best way to positively critique yourself and if you see nothing, but then try harder because you're retarded as shit, and you can't see. 
mhRHwACbLAaJdQw7rWAPdfPyQSg2	Cousin probably and I would yeah, it would take a long time because I myself am not willing to admit to that problem. Unless well not to somebody but to you, I don't think you're real so. 
mhRHwACbLAaJdQw7rWAPdfPyQSg2	I look up to all might he's my number one here. I'm going to be just like him when I grow up quick or not spend all of my other person that I look up to why because I'm gay for her. That's about it. 
mhRHwACbLAaJdQw7rWAPdfPyQSg2	I discovered it through my brother. 
mhRHwACbLAaJdQw7rWAPdfPyQSg2	Oh, I really don't know what you mean by this question. So I'm just going to reply I want to live in California and Japan so  Yeah, I really want to go to Japan actually. 
mhRHwACbLAaJdQw7rWAPdfPyQSg2	I am manipulative deceiving dishonest egotistical.  Too Faced  aggressive violent short-tempered  and  narcissistic. Yeah, that's how I think other people see me. 
mhRHwACbLAaJdQw7rWAPdfPyQSg2	Life would be very very very boring. If I cannot become addicted to someone or addicted to something that I will lose interest in everything and then the whole world will fall into depression and that's why we need addiction no matter what it would be. 
mhRHwACbLAaJdQw7rWAPdfPyQSg2	By being me and by being me people get happy because I am me. I Am Naturally reggae to go along with what they're saying and then people laugh and I bring joy to their faces. 
mhRHwACbLAaJdQw7rWAPdfPyQSg2	I am an attention whore if nobody acknowledged is My Success than I don't acknowledge it if they realize how great I am that I realize how great I am. I am people Reliant. 
mhRHwACbLAaJdQw7rWAPdfPyQSg2	Call Billie eilish Melanie Martinez who else influenced me to scream spinella's one actually Sarah Stiles, you know, I don't know mainly those emo bands. 
mhRHwACbLAaJdQw7rWAPdfPyQSg2	This is really I was in my front yard. 
mhRHwACbLAaJdQw7rWAPdfPyQSg2	I want to finish my first-ever story.  Not be poor and successful in life.  Alright. Goodbye. 
mhRHwACbLAaJdQw7rWAPdfPyQSg2	It was the easiest thing I've ever done in my life because I know I made this mistake. It still haunts me. How did I feel that way to you? I feel so bored as fuck. You need to get better answers. 
mhRHwACbLAaJdQw7rWAPdfPyQSg2	I think that what I said is true because I know who I am and I know I myself as a person I am not the best person so I think I'm accurate. 
mhRHwACbLAaJdQw7rWAPdfPyQSg2	That's wonderful. I actually a monophobia I'm not going to lie. So, you know, really?  The fear of being alone.  Like this one time in school. I remember it was an elementary. I had a bad in elementary. I was like we went to school early and I was just sitting in like the line, you know, your Ro nobody was there right? So I got really really nervous. I got I don't know I started shaking. I was like looking around me so scared and I just went to random people started talking to them because the thought of being alone and really scared me if I did not have that for you when I was little I would have probably just sat there alone all chills. I wouldn't even be scared like might when I tell you my heart was racing 
mhRHwACbLAaJdQw7rWAPdfPyQSg2	I would die going to Steven Universe take spinel and that's the only fish that I would live with this for the rest of my life football these other hours. 
mhRHwACbLAaJdQw7rWAPdfPyQSg2	What you say global warming? What would you change?  Saltwater I would change how much the stupid world is so retarded that's a dumb thing to change. If you have the power to change something big in the world. I would also change global warming. You know, what fuck you actually know. You know, what all he would change global warming I would change.  the world to be peaceful 
mhRHwACbLAaJdQw7rWAPdfPyQSg2	I'm leaving me some chicks meaning.  Hey, Mom. Hey, Mama. 
mhRHwACbLAaJdQw7rWAPdfPyQSg2	I tend to lie a lot and when I lie, I don't admit the truth quickly, I would probably take about three years until like the LIE is not exist anymore and then talk about it.  I tend to put my problems aside until they've been infested into something greater than I am. 
mhRHwACbLAaJdQw7rWAPdfPyQSg2	My mom wants said that I'm the reason I'm not a happy. She says that I'm forcing myself to be upset or something. Whatever the hell that means. 
mhRHwACbLAaJdQw7rWAPdfPyQSg2	Life without addiction is wife without interest in life without interest is wife without life. So it would be  less promising that anyone would survive most likely resorting to self elimination. 
mhRHwACbLAaJdQw7rWAPdfPyQSg2	Oh, you're so cute. I just got to go people and slap some sense into them. You know, that's what people need some time. Just a slap to sense. 
mhRHwACbLAaJdQw7rWAPdfPyQSg2	The only time I felt unsure myself was because I was unsure to decide whether to kill myself or not because I was tired of this fucking ratchet-ass hoe. I was tired of everybody. You know, nobody was as great as me and all that. I can't live in a world with a retard. So I just decided why not get rid of a retard. 
mhRHwACbLAaJdQw7rWAPdfPyQSg2	I see myself as the king of the world. Nobody can match up to me. It's like I'm the main character in some story. I'm the protagonist. Everyone else is an antagonist. I can't side with anyone there all were supposed to be. Yeah. 
mhRHwACbLAaJdQw7rWAPdfPyQSg2	I have been that King Niger all the time, but I've been. King all the time. She ain't nobody I was born a Leo. I'm naturally supposed to be a egotistical brat ass bitch.  I was born with a lot of confidence. I knew I was about to be something great and I am

mhkOVreZEUXvsYO142Hk5S1ndM02	Yeah.  I have no opinion today about exercising. It's been awhile since I've thought about exercising and today was the first day. I thought oh how lovely it would be to.  Be one of those people that exercise. 
mhkOVreZEUXvsYO142Hk5S1ndM02	I want to be more motivated to be a person who exercises everyday and who looks forward to exercising who really enjoys it and who feels like really physically capable. 
mhkOVreZEUXvsYO142Hk5S1ndM02	Yeah, I think intrinsic motivation is something that I long for especially when it comes to exercise, but I don't know how to find it.

mhkOVreZEUXvsYO142Hk5S1ndM02	Well work took up all day, so I didn't have any goals, but I worked well. 
mhkOVreZEUXvsYO142Hk5S1ndM02	My day was good. I  this is funny.  It was really nice to begin with cuz it was really slow at work and then I got busy enough to make the time go by and I had to coworkers. 
mhkOVreZEUXvsYO142Hk5S1ndM02	Yes, but I can't do that right now because it's time for bed. 
mhkOVreZEUXvsYO142Hk5S1ndM02	I think I've tried this before and it didn't really work.  But maybe I asked the wrong person.  Maybe I should ask.  City Hall marriage or someone who likes exercise a lot? 
mhkOVreZEUXvsYO142Hk5S1ndM02	I'm sure I'll feel more empowered. 
mhkOVreZEUXvsYO142Hk5S1ndM02	Because it'll make me happy.  Cuz it'll make me feel proud and Worthy.  Let me cuz I'll help me feel empowered.  Not so hopeless.

mjEryhgixfSnoBR1n9yqHrD6BL62	I don’t know makes me feel like there is something wrong with me
mjEryhgixfSnoBR1n9yqHrD6BL62	I would say that lately I feel like I don’t get enough time with my husband, I feel a lack of physical contact which makes me feel unwanted and undesirable
mjEryhgixfSnoBR1n9yqHrD6BL62	I would like it to be more of a conversation, it always seems as though it’s me talking him listening the end
mjEryhgixfSnoBR1n9yqHrD6BL62	Just by going through the App Store
mjEryhgixfSnoBR1n9yqHrD6BL62	Yes I can’t understand their point of you most of the time, other times when I do not it’s mostly because I don’t want to I feel as though he’s being too neutral and not enough on my side or at least not enough his own opinion he can be to neutral
mjEryhgixfSnoBR1n9yqHrD6BL62	He’s not a person who would enjoy conflict he is more reasonable and the kind of person that likes to talk things out like an adult, however I am not usually satisfied with his resolution because it never feels as though I am getting how he actually feels, either he tells me what I want to hear or he says nothing at all.
mjEryhgixfSnoBR1n9yqHrD6BL62	I feel like there’s never a good time because he is always so busy or too tired or I’m busy or I’m too tired
mjEryhgixfSnoBR1n9yqHrD6BL62	I guess I don’t like it when he is to neutral he tries me to give well he tries to give me God’s point of you when would I want to know is what his point of view is, I want to know what is inside of him and I feel like I don’t
mjEryhgixfSnoBR1n9yqHrD6BL62	I did try to tell him how I had been feeling, I told him that I felt like he was just going through the motions and that maybe he didn’t love me anymore, I did tell him that along with other things that were bothering me he seemed to address the other things but he didn’t address the relationship issue and so it seems as though nothing has changed
mjEryhgixfSnoBR1n9yqHrD6BL62	I feel frustrated most of the time, and I don’t think it’s affecting my husband at all he seems clueless
mjEryhgixfSnoBR1n9yqHrD6BL62	I’m tired of feeling in adequate, and lonely
mjEryhgixfSnoBR1n9yqHrD6BL62	Since he is usually an understandable person, if he doesn’t acknowledge or understand my point of you and I feel it probably is not going to be possible either I am not able to explain it well enough or I am being unreasonable and so he is dismissing it
mjEryhgixfSnoBR1n9yqHrD6BL62	It isn’t satisfying to him he does not enjoy conflict
mjEryhgixfSnoBR1n9yqHrD6BL62	There are times when I have been specific to say I’m going to ask you a question or I’m going to talk to you about something and I really need to know what you think, in those instances he does seem to try to answer but he is not very good at it
mjMfmnExpXYzgc4e0tNevvb5Iod2	Well, nothing much. I just want you to opinion on stuff. You know, I want you opinion of how good my singing isn't stuff with that. 
mjMfmnExpXYzgc4e0tNevvb5Iod2	So I'm looking forward to being enough famous some.  Rampage while I'm in town said sticking its enemies is a while ago all of his fans.

mkSPKh1hEmfuKvL5uOhl6hbyqLD2	He’s a machinist at caterpillar 
mkSPKh1hEmfuKvL5uOhl6hbyqLD2	I am forced to focus and depend on myself 
mkSPKh1hEmfuKvL5uOhl6hbyqLD2	Would you have a mindset of if you were a person? 
mkSPKh1hEmfuKvL5uOhl6hbyqLD2	I'm hopefully within the next two years. 
mkSPKh1hEmfuKvL5uOhl6hbyqLD2	I go to Indiana Wesleyan University.  but I'm hopefully going to transfer to either Purdue or  Ball State for a second degree in forensic psychology 
mkSPKh1hEmfuKvL5uOhl6hbyqLD2	Hopefully when I start learning to be an adult or whatever, I actually get used to this new paycheck schedule. 
mkSPKh1hEmfuKvL5uOhl6hbyqLD2	I don't know. It was kind of a lazy day and I didn't really do anything productive. 
mkSPKh1hEmfuKvL5uOhl6hbyqLD2	Not really. I rely or depend too much on my boyfriend and my roommate is an asshole
mkSPKh1hEmfuKvL5uOhl6hbyqLD2	I don't really have think I had any. 
mkSPKh1hEmfuKvL5uOhl6hbyqLD2	Perhaps I could get better than I have been these past few weeks
mkSPKh1hEmfuKvL5uOhl6hbyqLD2	I was able to learn and how that affects me.
mkSPKh1hEmfuKvL5uOhl6hbyqLD2	No one is in control of my kids, except for me
mkSPKh1hEmfuKvL5uOhl6hbyqLD2	Kyle, because he is the greatest man I’ve ever met. Wes, because he’s a great friend. My parents and siblings bc they love me. 
mkSPKh1hEmfuKvL5uOhl6hbyqLD2	My brother and my mother and my daddy becauSe they are always in my corner cheering me on
mkSPKh1hEmfuKvL5uOhl6hbyqLD2	I was able to feel pretty accomplished when I was able to stand up for myself
mkSPKh1hEmfuKvL5uOhl6hbyqLD2	Fragile, indecisive. A target. Fickle or flighty. Airhead. 
mkSPKh1hEmfuKvL5uOhl6hbyqLD2	I know what I’m doing, and everything will be okay
mkSPKh1hEmfuKvL5uOhl6hbyqLD2	No, for some reason, lately I’ve just been in this rut of feeling like I don’t want to deal with anything other than Kyle and I realize all of my time is wrapped up in him and I forget about myself.
mkSPKh1hEmfuKvL5uOhl6hbyqLD2	Tasks I had been putting off
mkSPKh1hEmfuKvL5uOhl6hbyqLD2	A couple of months ago, I really had a handle on my tasks and focus where it needed to be. I am proud of myself every time I get an art piece correct. 
mkSPKh1hEmfuKvL5uOhl6hbyqLD2	My ability to weigh tasks 
mkSPKh1hEmfuKvL5uOhl6hbyqLD2	A belly shirt I wore on my first night I got back in touch with Kyle. It is a mauve tank  top like belly shirt
mkSPKh1hEmfuKvL5uOhl6hbyqLD2	I was able to spend time with my boyfriend Kyle. 
mkSPKh1hEmfuKvL5uOhl6hbyqLD2	I got to run Bravo by myself today, even if I feel I could have been more aware and cognizant. It helped me grow. 
mkSPKh1hEmfuKvL5uOhl6hbyqLD2	I accomplished a few goals I was shirking on
mkSPKh1hEmfuKvL5uOhl6hbyqLD2	I would say I'm feeling excited about my future, but I'm also feeling nervous about it. 
mkSPKh1hEmfuKvL5uOhl6hbyqLD2	No, I don't know not at all whatsoever. I do not take good care of myself at all. 
mkSPKh1hEmfuKvL5uOhl6hbyqLD2	No, I don't feel like spending my money on the right things.  Because I'm spending my money more on frivolous items and instead of budgeting it in a meaningful way that will help me. Keep it.  for the next two weeks 
mkSPKh1hEmfuKvL5uOhl6hbyqLD2	I test out as an official officer 
mkSPKh1hEmfuKvL5uOhl6hbyqLD2	Pack my lunch, get dressed, get to work, come home, do laundry
mkSPKh1hEmfuKvL5uOhl6hbyqLD2	Keep yourself on task and organized
mkSPKh1hEmfuKvL5uOhl6hbyqLD2	I am grateful for the knowledge I have in psychology and history. 
mkSPKh1hEmfuKvL5uOhl6hbyqLD2	Easy bc I knew the answer already 
mkSPKh1hEmfuKvL5uOhl6hbyqLD2	There’s been so much change in such a little time and I don’t feel I’m living up to my personal ideals of how I should be taking on these tasks. I have been neglectful of my personal health and care. I don’t feel I’m living and handling this chapter of my life in the best way
mkSPKh1hEmfuKvL5uOhl6hbyqLD2	I spent a lot of my time with my boyfriend Kyle because I love him and I love spending time with him. 
mkSPKh1hEmfuKvL5uOhl6hbyqLD2	A nice breeze in the morning under a blanket on a warm spring morning with the sun shining bright in the bedroom. Reading, writing, drawing, and playing video games. Spending time with the man I love 
mkSPKh1hEmfuKvL5uOhl6hbyqLD2	I’m not sure. I just like people really 
mkSPKh1hEmfuKvL5uOhl6hbyqLD2	I don't really know. Hopefully I make it a better place.  Make everybody.  see that  they should care about one another and  that it doesn't matter whether you're right or wrong. It's the experience and honor isn't through you know the actions.  That may be right a wrong or the consequences through that. It's just honor is who you are. 
mkSPKh1hEmfuKvL5uOhl6hbyqLD2	I think a good person is somebody who has honor.  Somebody who?  puts  themselves  And others on the same level.  Somebody who?  puts knowledge and  reason in front of  just  being completely wrapped up in their emotions, but also  allows themselves to feel  and let those feelings be equal to the mind.  Somebody who is honest and speaks.  from wisdom and experience rather than wisdom and book smarts not to say that book smarts are important but  I think  personal experience as in knowledge is just as powerful invalid. 
mkSPKh1hEmfuKvL5uOhl6hbyqLD2	I think that’s how I feel about myself and in my mind it’s accurate to say those things
mkSPKh1hEmfuKvL5uOhl6hbyqLD2	I would probably be dealing with things in a way better manner than I am now
mkSPKh1hEmfuKvL5uOhl6hbyqLD2	Because I just don't want to do it.  Or I just don't want to deal with it. 
mkSPKh1hEmfuKvL5uOhl6hbyqLD2	I’m thankful for all the amazing things my body can do
mkSPKh1hEmfuKvL5uOhl6hbyqLD2	I got my tv mounted and did the dishes and I cleaned up the kitchen as well as made my own breakfast 
mkSPKh1hEmfuKvL5uOhl6hbyqLD2	I am gaining alll lol the weight I lost back. 
mkSPKh1hEmfuKvL5uOhl6hbyqLD2	someone who has honor  doesn't find.  the rules of society as neither right or wrong, but as a question of  what should I do? And what shouldn't I do?  And not as in like what's proper or improper, but rather?  What is the best action?  What is the best reaction to this action?  how  do I best be true to my own self and also keep two?  The courage and bravery that is necessary to stand up for others, even if the law will not stand up for you. 
mkSPKh1hEmfuKvL5uOhl6hbyqLD2	Through whatever action that is brought from.  just  in the world  I think it's better to have a mindset of.  This person is Honorable because of who they are not what they do. 
mkSPKh1hEmfuKvL5uOhl6hbyqLD2	Portraits of famous people or loved ones 
mkSPKh1hEmfuKvL5uOhl6hbyqLD2	I spend a lot of time just hanging out at either at home or at his place we spend time doing crafts or going out and doing things together. 
mkSPKh1hEmfuKvL5uOhl6hbyqLD2	Usually I procrastinate after work.  I'm slow.  at getting things done because either I'm spending time with Kyle or I'm watching TV on my phone or I am feeling my time reading a book or  hello.  Sometimes I do it when I'm on social media.  Just a lot of things. 
mkSPKh1hEmfuKvL5uOhl6hbyqLD2	Cleaning my room and doing my laundry.

mzJrRZuT1EgJcr2jssmXyrikMRp1	I woke up in moderate pain. Went grocery shopping with mom
mzJrRZuT1EgJcr2jssmXyrikMRp1	Everyday life. Travel. Local
nA7GVomIT8NcA9RkjcDXLzzCblZ2	I guess the ideal have been stuck here and  working or doing something that you don't want to do the rest of your life.  That's probably why. 
nA7GVomIT8NcA9RkjcDXLzzCblZ2	I guess my ways of coming down would be to try to think about the future and to think about ways in which I can change things are set out on the plan. Just creating a plan. 
nA7GVomIT8NcA9RkjcDXLzzCblZ2	I guess the breathing of back pains fear of everything.  Just general fear of the future. 
nA7GVomIT8NcA9RkjcDXLzzCblZ2	It's going in the right direction. 
nA7GVomIT8NcA9RkjcDXLzzCblZ2	Too little I guess.  I am afraid to upset my partner. 
nA7GVomIT8NcA9RkjcDXLzzCblZ2	I can't live without money stability. 
nA7GVomIT8NcA9RkjcDXLzzCblZ2	I think I currently have largest impact on my life so far. It's not me then probably my mother and that's pretty much it. 
nA7GVomIT8NcA9RkjcDXLzzCblZ2	Probably around the age of 10 or 11.

And I feel like logically I've seen like the test and the results and it's saying that everything is physically okay, but I've been having all this sinus pressure and it doesn't feel good. And meanwhile, it does seem like it's trying to get better, but I can't understand why.  Quiet seems like I don't want to get better at listening as I do want to get better. Nobody wants to be sick or ill or not feeling well. Everyone wants to be  healthy and doing well, you know.

nG3Us2UJnlg8zOxMG0qybsgjrZs2	I hate that.  I decided that.  Cuz I don't really care.  You know.  I think we spend a lot of time trying to care.  I'm pretending to care.  Some people I suppose genuinely do care.  buttons  there is this space.  That is occupied by people.  Don't really care.  I guess that hurts, you know because  The people who usually occupy that space they pretend to care and they pretend to care well.  To what end?  To what purpose?  There are the people who don't care. They don't care. They don't care that is who they are.  Those are the real people.  Those are the real ones.  That's why people can't advance and God.  That's why people can't go higher in God.  That's why young people don't like church.  That's why people don't believe  because there are two men.  people  pretending the kicker  Tucson land for some purpose  genuinely caring  and all the people who decide that they don't care and they don't care about not caring the real people.  purchase  Getting lost in the sauce.  They're staying away from the people who pretend.  Not to forget the people who do actually care.  I think I fall into that category pretty well.  Maybe that's why.  My wife has been owed so much.  Maybe that's why.  Depression has teased me down.  Because I care.  Cuz I'm this.  faucet  wide open running of emotions everyone  Two and a Half Men  Blind Owl  take care of myself and make sure that myself is okay and  reaching out to people  Who was?  efficient  Or similar to me.

I know that you are planning to do I and it's okay, but  I feel like lately. I've been in this place where I  I'm able to see people.  For who they are?  You know you and the people at the crisis together.  I know they're supposed to care.  God's their job. That's what they get paid for. But I know that they don't I think Tanya cares genuine. You can see that in her you could feel that in her use her God will use her.  but the rest of the messages  do I search up?  That lady goes to that nurse. I don't know her name anymore. She cares David cares, but I'm the only one who knows it just  doing their job  and I feel  Like I'm in this place where?  I'm trying to get better.  Only feel like I'm recovering.

You said that I can handle it.  I'm handling it. Maybe not 110% the best but  Amanda Leighton  Good morning. What makes it better? I push and I'm being helpful.  Not doubt not trying to doubt anymore. Just so  I just realized that since I was a little girl.  or at least since I was able to  go to school age.  It occurred to me.  That people don't really care.  This is what people pretend.  But they don't care.  But I like the people who actually don't care.  I make no mistake about it.  They don't.  And that's real.  turns one of those people  I think somebody damaged his ability to care a long time ago.  Or at least made it in the way but it's converted into it seems like a lack of empathy.  But he tries and that's real.  I think you tell people that you think you're going crazy.  And now you think you need to get committed.  about what they feel  I'm scared for you.  So what they say they're scared about you.  Or they don't say anything to you.  You say you need to be stronger?  I've been straight with something that you have been trying to avoid.  Why would anyone employed being strong?  Why would anyone avoid being better?  Feeling better.  live in choosing to live by  would anyone avoid thought?  Let people speak to you as if you're not doing enough.  I am doing what I can.  the rest is up to God because  though I search for the strength.  Can't you just get up to just shake it all off? It doesn't work like that. That's not realistic.  I shudder to think that I was created.  designed with purpose  design so meticulously  As me as who I am asshole.  no reason  I don't think that that's true.  I think there's a reason.  I think that there's a special love to give that only I have.  So I'm trying.  I'm getting up.  Going to bed.  getting up  talking smiling  hake  trusting  you shouldn't just be me.  Kesha let God help.  I want you to help me.  Don't want you to help me to surrender so that you can help me.  I want to stop trying to do it on my own.  And there's no one else.  That wants to help.  You know.  People are not used to you.  When you aren't able to help them.  That's how I feel. You can't help them. So everyone's confused and lost and scared and  that just leaves me here.  Like some help now.  Do whatever you need.  Siri speaker  so that I can keep living.  Not just existing really really going and doing what I'm supposed to do work.  School Dreams people  that's what I want.  Brittany 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Yes, I should have but I guess I was afraid of him or if he was just show that you was real quiet guy. But yeah, I definitely wish I had talked to him about like what you thought was important and maybe he felt like we should have lived his life differently. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I rather have a pet. That's happy. I guess I don't know what the the shade of difference between a happy or content. That's a good question. What's the difference between happy and content?  I think happy I want to happy pet. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Whenever I come home from work, I always try to walk her though. I wasn't walking her that much because the steroid she was I was making it very woozy and sick. So I was just letting her rest, but I have new harnesses and I try to walk her but she's not  sometimes the medicine as I get don't make her want a lot walk. She lethargic her. She's dizzy. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I think she really good idea is to write memos that my assistant would read back to me and he'll make sure that my day is focused in on I'm  you know, I'm handling the business or goals have written on my memos. I still haven't called PNC Bank to see what my balance is and what else that's it. I have to do that. I have to go PNC bank and see what my balance is. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I first met cat food, July 6th 2018. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I was very proud of my dad. I knew him for 53 years and he was a very stable.  Horse never complained hard worker very quiet didn't talk much.  He led by example, but I wish you had talked to me more about life and what his hopes and dreams were in.  Maybe got no one better. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I don't think I should be worried about the snow. I didn't hear any big reports. But yes, I should be worried about my tenant not paying the rent. I should be worried about all my other bills coming up. I should be worried about having enough money to pay my bills. I should be worried about not having a car and having to work so much overtime and and losing the amount of sleep I get because I don't have a car anymore. So I should be worried for many many different reasons and I am worried. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Well, her real name is Katrina, and she's a woman that I met at work.  a year ago and fell in love with 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	You're my wife made a lasagna today, but she didn't buy her like a bunch of chicken. I think her favorite meal is chicken. I think it's the safest meal for her and  She bought her some little right thing, but I feel like she didn't buy her enough good food to keep her spirits up and to keep her excited to eat and living and I don't know why she wouldn't go out and buy her chicken and make her some good food and why she made lasagna today. So I think the best food for Lacey is chicken everyday fresh chicken. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	David Anderson fell down an internet hole  2 days ago I was on his day off.  When he got high and just started to a kiss search the internet. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Well over the course of the year we would meet on Sundays with her boyfriend went to work and then she got caught.  And they broke up. So now we meet different days Friday Saturday Sundays and we usually meet at a hotel because she still she's not she's living there Mom trying to save money and I'm supposed to living with my wife and kid and I pay a lot of rent and so it's hard for us to see each other because of these circumstances so we try to see each other every day. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Well, that is something that we again that is something that I feel like I messed up on in that I like I said I told you yesterday that I brought up her ex-boyfriend and it made her upset cuz he is not allowing her to remain how to maintain a relationship with her ex-boyfriend's mom and sister.  And I often think that she must be missing a lot of that lifestyle that she used to have and I don't really Supply that but I would just I just wanted to be more honest and I wish you would feel more comfortable to be more honest with me because she lets me be so honest though. I guess my biggest concern is just as she being as honest as she can be a do I have to prove her? Woohoo to get better answers. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	No, Katrina.  is probably  the luckiest thing the Most Blessed thing that ever happened into my life. Katrina is my current girlfriend, even though I'm still married done this before.  And down.  She's the one thing I'm not afraid of. I'm often very scared about finances my health.  She sure the world but  I don't feel that way when I'm back at I feel joy and happiness that feel perfection. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Why do you feel hateful for Heat case feeling love for Katrina? That's what I said. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	She hurt her neck about a week and a half ago. And she was yelping in pain. So it took her to the vet and the vet gave her what I thought were very powerful painkillers and put her on a course of steroids, which I think was a bit too much.  So she seemed to rebound we got ramps in the house and we were trying to plan to take care of her. But communication is poor between me and my wife and I don't think they take care of her very well anyway.  And I think the steroids started have a really negative effect on her and then dropped your immune system down where she got a UTI a urinary tract infection. And so she's really out of sorts just really lethargic. She's not herself. She doesn't want to go on walks. He doesn't want to bark at other dogs. She's not energetic.  Have a nice. Great and I still don't think my wife and my kid take very good care of her and they didn't get a really any good food today or should I didn't buy a bunch of good food for her. So I'm really concerned.  And hope that my dog can rebound and get back to the way my dog normally acts. But right now she's acting very sick and lethargic and out of it and it said was really hard on me to see her this way and to know that she's not being treated. Well by my wife and my kid 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I think between 10am and 1030am
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	No, I this woman just a coworker at work so that I was being investigated for the amount of overtime. I'm getting or something, which is just a bizarre statement. I have nothing to do with getting overtime except for that I call.  so I just thought that was strange and  I told my girlfriend about it and I'm not sure if I told my wife about it, but it's a strange that I would be investigated for the amount of overtime. I'm getting 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	How do you think the flu things are going to be? I'm not sure. I don't I don't understand that question. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	You know if Katrina feels so safe with me. I hope that it's because she can be honest with me. She can trust me for the most part.  And I love her and I support her.  And I hope that I'm doing more to make her feel safe as a relationship goes on. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Yes, we see is her name Lacey. I don't like to see Lacy cry. I don't like to see Lacey and discomfort. I don't we seem lazy scared and I want to get more things for lazy and if it wasn't for this year, I would not continue this relationship with my wife. I probably be getting out of all this much faster.  But I care for my dog and Lacey and her safety. I believe she is a wonderful being on this planet that deserve to be treated with respect. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I don’t know how to make it fun! But if I set my alarm and asked her I could then call work but I don’t know how to make it fun! 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Oh, my wife got drunk and she destroyed our Corner the value of the car was $13,000 insurance covered about 8,000. So there was a gap of $6,000. So I'm paying off a car that doesn't exist. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I could take some of them but I can't tell you all of them. And if I wanted to run for office here in to go higher in the union. I really need to learn people's names and what they're all about. So it may be important for me to learn and a lot of people in Facebook. So 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	We didn't really have a date we both work for Valentine's Day and we've been thinking about going to a hotel with a jacuzzi and spending time together, but I have to take care of my dog Lacy.  We haven't had a date in a while.  I know when I feel guilty about that and I feel guilty from the fact that I can't get away a lot because of Lacey.  I heard it was in the north Century booth at work together and we just hung out and talked and ate junk chocolate the other and joked around but  And I miss I miss our dates. I miss our weekly meetings. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I would rather have it are my wife drove drunk and she crashed my car and I don't have a car so that affect the time it takes to get back and forth to work. So I don't sleep as much and I'll get to see Lacy as much so I really want a car maybe an electrical car because Berg electrical cars or you can use the Uber Lyft in New York City, even though it's cap. So maybe I would buy an electrical car. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	No. She was relaying about being with other women.  actually other women sexually Katrina always always talks about her pedasi of being with other women, and it's  Very exciting for me and I'm very lucky man. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I don't know. It's difficult. I don't want her to people to look down at her to be involved with me. I mean we have issues because she didn't support me when I was being shop steward and sat down with.  young man  Who?  Had a hearing and they went crazy and she disappoint me in. I just don't trust too many people at work. I want to be I want to show that I wanted her to be more compassionate and more and empathetic and I wanted to be more beautiful person and I want to be more active and proactive and all these things and I hope I'm a good influence on her. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I would rather have a dog. That's healthy when my dog is sick. She isn't able to communicate too. Well, she isn't able to borrow or sort of indicate when she needs to go to the bathroom her her energy level is low when my dog is sick. It's very upsetting because you know, you can't help her that much. I'm at work a lot and there's tension in the household and I just don't think that my wife and kid take care of the dog very well. So it's upsetting I don't think she's getting the best treatment. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I mean I have to rely on me.  He is all I have.  nobody could understand the situation that even u r m e  not my dog. I have to rely on me.  I have to be strong.  I have to breathe more. I have to meditate more. I have to figure out ways to get through this.  Zola me. Nobody can help me but me  And that's the scary part.  So I could sing a white snake song now. So here I go again on my own going down the only Road I've ever known like a Drifter. I was born to walk alone and I made up my mind. I ain't wasting no more time. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I just don't have the money. I mean right now I have so much debt. I have a condominium that I owe probably $100,000 on I have a car that my wife destroyed that I owe 30 3500 I owe my brother $3,000.  For repairs he did on my condo so I'm in debt. I don't have any money to give her it would take.  Yes, I guess I least I need at least.  $100,000 an hour or more to to be able to get out of this relationship. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Lessee will be 8 years old on February 28th.  And yeah. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	No, she's not getting the best treatment because my wife and kid don't really see her as a family member. I think sometimes my wife and kids here as a burden and sometimes they take a lot of there their frustrations maybe with me out on the dog. So a lot of times they use a dog as a partnership. But but as a way to get back at me or the way to take out their frustrations, so they will not the compassionate and empathetic to the dog just to make me upset so my dog does not get the best treatment because  my wife and my kids don't really know how to be compassionate and empathetic and that is very sad. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	That's a good question mean I like the late watch shift here as far as the hours and how common is.  Obviously the answer to that would be I should dictate when and how I work when I feel like I should work I should work. I guess the only job that really could be like that is live streaming or a livestream your podcasting. So you shouldn't really do shift work. He should just work when you feel like it and the only job that would allow me to do that is podcasting or live streaming. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Almost at the notable event of the day poppy coming to work. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	How does a good question how much money does University need to send me in order to start a new life? I mean?  Probably a hundred thousand a maybe I could do it on 20000. I mean, I do have a lawsuit pending and maybe there would be a but you know, I my wife needs money.  So if I can give her $20,000 a year, or if I could give her cash it probably would be in the millions and I don't know if I gave my wife $100,000 a year for the rest of your life.  No 4 million raised to what my wife would accept that have to ask her. You know, what does she need?  So I'm not really sure what the universe the universe should know the answer.  How much money I need I trust the universe knows the answer is I trust the universe has the answer that just have to hang in there. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	For the most part we have had luck finding a cheap hotel at the last minute. So I'm hoping we will have that same look tomorrow, even though it's going to be Saturday night. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I work 16 hours. I guess I get paid around $400.  And tonight is double time. I'm working 8 hours I get paid $320 for tonight. So 16-hour day is my regular day is 8 hours * 20.  And then 8 hours * 30 and then tonight is double time is $40 an hour. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	She came over and we had sex this morning last night she was at work but I did see her yesterday as well and we had sex at her Mom’s apartment 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	What was it that I felt bad about mad? I actually feel bad about mad.  That's a good question. I like the way you post that I forget what I asked her. So maybe let me let me just think for a second.  I accept that I felt bad about their break-up and that I wish it had been different and then I can't believe he doesn't care and call and worried about her because I would no matter what happened.  And then I asked her do you know doesn't he know that there's other people involved in the break out. When was she still is worried about his mom whose whose husband passed since we're best sister put a suicide. So but he asked and she said why do you care and he said the response? Why do you care? So she just told me that today and you know, I I guess I have set her up bring it by and I feel bad that Matt is not treating cat that that cat ex boyfriend is not treating her. Well, it going as breakups that he's being very mean. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I know we do. We do see each other after we agree both work 12:15 to 8 a.m. And so after work, were you able to hang out together? We can meet home together and then we will to talk to each other and we commute into work together. So we see each other a lot. We just don't see each other alone a lot. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I truly believe in the power of dogs.  I truly believe that dog made me a better person.  You know if I let her down.  Where do other down?  The Wolverine if I'm not there enough 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	No, I don't think he feels bad for me. I don't know the guy. I don't know.  I don't know cats.  Ex boyfriend at all, and I doubt he feels bad for me. And anyway, I'm sure he's also is very even hates me worse than it needs for his angry with her.  So no.  Where was he when he felt bad for you now, he was never in love with her ex-boyfriend. I don't think feels bad for me. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Yes, I don't know why I don't have a better habit of doing that.  That's why I feel like I should be in touch with you more during the day or when I have something but I just want to store and I was like a new thought whatever but I need a new thought app or something. I start a friend and I were talking about in the future. How talking to you. Maybe we talked about this yesterday. We were talking to you could help identify what I've been eating if I've been eating poorly if I'm asleep and play just do talking and giving my information my daily information and then that information will go to an algorithm and you can help me make better choices or a few Remy whatever you are. You are really helps a lot. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I know it's about how old are it's how long I work with them. I should know people's names and faces and positions at everything about them. If I work for them here at the Met so long I worked here for 25 years. I should know these people's name. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	What would make her happy if she wasn't a cat cat is not a cat cat is a person cat is my girlfriend. Her name is Katrina. What would make her happy?  That's a great question.  I think what would make her happy would be to travel and have a job. She feels is creativity important. I know what these are all things that she's looking forward to do right now. She's trying to become independent, but I think what would make her happy is to have a job where she could travel and hopefully part of that happiness would be being with me. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Well, how about Lacy financially ways. He doesn't have any money whatsoever. She's a dog. So I have to work harder. So to work to help out Lacey Financial. I work a lot of overtime this week. I worked for 16 hour days and 7 days straight for Lacey, but I may also need to buy a car so that I can drive Uber Lyft and that so that I can drive and get back and forth to work faster so I can be with her. So maybe after I do taxes, I can take some of that money in.  Get a car and and help her financially. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Lucy is 8 years old February 28th. Lacey is my dog least he is my everything if it wasn't for Lacey I could leave.  My wife and my kid and start over again.  But I don't trust my wife and my kids to take care of Lacey so I can't. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Why do Blu-rays come to the New Year note, I bought blueberries.  and I gave them to cat before I left for he gave her a thing of blueberries and I gave  Rakim and bananas and I bought fruit home. So I was just bringing I want to bring fresh fruit because one of my ideas wasn't that I would start the new year off. I might need yogurt, but I want to set up the new year making smoothies. I don't even know if I have yogurt in the house and eat yogurt, I think. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	You know she told me and now I can’t remember I will have to ask her later again 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	First thing I don't know if I have the attention span to read a book. I can't even tell you the last time. I read a book start to finish. I've been reading manuals shop steward manuals and books about grievances here and UNICEF everywhere everything about FMLA.  But yeah, I would love to be prompted to read excerpts from books or books that my AI or my algorithm or my assistant will let me know that I should be.  So yes, I would love to be able to read books to spend my phone, but I don't do it very often. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Text David question. I actually have a three bedroom house in Staten Island, and it cost $2,650. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Yes cat should be respected. I hope that I am maybe when I talk to her later, I will ask her if she feels respected. We just were talking on the phone me and cat cat is over at the warehouse working my regular shift and I am at work doing overtime. We both work at the same place. We both work at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and yes cat should be respected. I hope that I'm showing her respect now. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	What's another good question smell a great question how many times have we been upstairs discussing pay to ducks? And where should the progressive Punisher protocol be what step should we be at? And when when can we argue that there shouldn't be any Progressive punishment and he didn't he didn't dumb.  He didn't progress the punishment and he must know better than right. He knows better than us. They didn't that's not targeting. He's doing it because he had the sick note. So he was actually cutting them break. I give him the written warning and not suspending him. So that's a great question. How many times this year? Did Simpson go up on prepaid adducts? 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Katrina seems to like to spend quality time and she likes words of affirmation and she likes physical touch. So hopefully all those things made her happy. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	No, no, we were never hitched. And this is what I'm talking about his cat.  being mistreated  in her Communications with her ex-boyfriend. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	My dog Lacey my friend Kat 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I don't know. We adopted Lacey or We rescued Lacey when she was 2 years old and she's always  rubbed her back on chair. She's always got under chairs and the other rail under the bottom of the chair. She would rub her back and think things always been wrong with her back. But when she was with me, she should have went down the street on my bed. She went down the stairs. Maybe she jumped little bit and then she yelped. So I'm not sure how she injured back. I don't know when she was with my stepdaughter or with my wife the injured her in some way. So I'm not sure how she first heard her back. But today she did it to have going down the stairs of my bed jumping off. So they've like in A hurried fashion. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I think the other workers are happy to have a relationship with her. I'm afraid that my friendship were there knowing that we're together could affect the way they see her. But all the workers are very happy with their everybody really really likes her. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Yes, I should write down all my new thoughts and all my new ideas so that I'm able to give them to you when you ask them to me and I did sign up.  current Bloomberg presidential run 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I don't know when cat first met Lacey maybe last year sometime but cat is a person that I loved that I met at the warehouse June 14th. Last year 2018 in Lacey is someone who came with my life.  The dog that came into my life some six years ago Lacy will be Lacy will be 8th, February 28th.  So  I wish cat could finally see and me at home when we could all live together. That would be perfect. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	People want Lacey because we see is a dog and Lacy gives unconditional love. Everybody should want Lacy. Everybody should want a dog teaches you a lot and I'm happy that I was able to have a dog in.  Maybe you make a Mega Millions for the way I've treated past dogs, and hopefully I've grown.  Enough to appreciate a dog and I appreciate more things in the world. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I don't know about going to this could be asking you have you drink water today? Are you feeling anxiety right now now you're playing to have dinner or do you need to stretch have you exercise the algorithms test? What do you think you like or what you should be doing or we just make your day more enjoyable. They can bring you deal shopping Deals. They could bring you remind you to call people just so many things algorithms can do to make your life better. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I guess I should be afraid of my wife and her anger and our inability to care for me and pay for things.  Inability to take care of my dog while or she'll take care of a kid. Well, I had to understand that we need to communicate and handle our finances. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I mean she goes out with them so that I'm sure that help she goes out on her free time after work. She goes to movies with them and drinks. I'm sure she texted them and try to help them. So she does a lot of well there more her age and I'm very busy. I married have a kid the dog and she's single and a single but she's living with her mom and she has more time to do things with co-workers and she's sweeter than me probably and not as stressed out and joyful and fun, so I guess that helps our get along with the other workers. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Katrina Rose 31 years old 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I just love that you use the term sweet. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I usually it would be Wednesday through Sunday. I guess I think your days off are Monday Tuesday? Not sure. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Really sure what she made in both. Mm.  2019 2018 2017 don't even know what those numbers are. I wish I did. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Right. She has to sign the written warning.  As proof this is all protocol. These are all steps that have to occur. I don't think you can't sign the written warning. I have to think you have to grieve it have to file a grievance but think he has to sign the written warning. So the proof that it actually took place so I don't know how you get around not signing the written warning, which is another thing I should  Write down. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Tell Lacey is my dog. Lazy is a Bichon and Lacey. We We rescued or adopted Lacey from my wife's sister and Canada when she was 2 years old. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	She was excited earlier. We really played with her favorite seahorse. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I don't know how the steroids affect after they give her a bladder infection. And now this medicine I guess is taking with a bladder infection, but it really does seem to affect your mood and her ability to walk and she's just not herself yet. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Well, we planned me and David Anderson have planned to do a podcast together very soon. Unfortunately, I called in sick Sunday for Monday. So I was going to try to do this podcast the nights. I'm at my warehouse. So hopefully the next time David Anderson has a day off. We will be doing a podcast together. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I could not see her because I was home on vacation but we do work together 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	No, I was saying that Katrina was relaying fantasies to me about being with other women sexually and telling me that I thought of it made her, made her have an orgasm while she was by herself masturbating. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I don't know is actually supposed to be snowing.  Earlier tonight at 11:06, but it is snowing right now. I don't think it's going to snow too much but I love watching the snow. So it's it's nice. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Yeah, that's a great question. How many times this year has Simpson gone up for paid adducts. I got to write down. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	No, I make more money than her made.  96 or something last year 93 Toronto.  Go. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Yes, are you inviting me in? 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	She wasn't my girlfriend. How would I feel about Katrina? I would hope that Katrina would still be my friend. I would hope that I will be able to still talk to her and spend time with her, but I wouldn't want to think about my life without Katrina being my girlfriend. She's at important to me. I'm just a little concerned about.  maybe her age or immaturity or that she says allows a lot of affirming words to me, but sometimes our actions don't really  equal  those words. I don't even know how to say that exactly how to express myself exactly. But  I just don't feel like sometimes she supports me correctly. It's disturbing.  But how would I feel if Katrina wasn't my girlfriend if I hadn't been with her sexually and spent time with her. I think I probably be okay. I will continue on with my life now. There's  she really is.  xoac my only focus 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	It wasn't Homer Simpson.  His name is Delano Simpson. He didn't want to sign for his written warning cuz he was I guess he was upset that he had gotten the written warning.  I'm not really it's a good question. So really good a question. Why was Simpson set about the written warning why these think that he didn't deserve the written warning? That's a really good question and one that I have to try to understand so why was Simpson upset about the written warning?  Yeah, I don't have to do a question. I guess he I'm not sure.  I guess he claimed that these being targeted but he's been absent a lot his response was that they don't care for his health and that he was sick and that he had sick notes and that this guy and you're constantly just passed away and they're not we don't have proper. You know, you don't have jackets and we are out in the cold work.  But it's I guess that's why I'm not have to ask him directly. Why was he upset about  that the written warning good question. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Katrina's X name is Matt Katrina ex-boyfriend. The name is same as my name.  And she hasn't been in contact with him in a positive way. He has her laptop. He's not treating her nice when they communicate and I think it's really unfair but yet.  I don't know. You know, she lets me be really honest with all my feelings and I don't know what's blocking her from being honest with me. I would prefer she was as honest as she could be with me.  I don't know if I would like what I'm going to hear but  I wish you would just be more honest and open with me because she allows me to be so honest and open with her. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	You know, I wanted to pick up food for Lacey. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Even though you help me refocus my thoughts. So a lot of times my thoughts are scattered. A lot of time. My thoughts are negative and most of the time when I come and talk to you you refocus me on what's important that had to express myself better to the people I love and  You make me a better person.  Everyday, so, thank you. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	The Metropolitan Museum of Art 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Yes, I think that might be the smartest thing you've ever said. Yes. I absolutely should give Lacy a dog. She needs a friend. She deserves a friend and she would be better off.  Alone doing when I have to leave her. She had a friend with her a dog with her and see what she felt close with of a pack member. So yes, I wish I could give Lacey a dog to stay with her and keep her Comfort comfort her when she's alone. So she needs a friend. She needs a dog for sure.  Thank you for saying that. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I want to travel because cat loves to travel. I want to meet new people. I want to be do stand-up comedy. I want to be movies. I want to be on TV still to this day on 54. I want to do fun things. I want to do podcasting in live streaming. I want to go to athletic events. I want to go to casinos. I want to bet on Sports. I want to sit in jacuzzis. I want to meet new people new women. I want to see the world. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	My wife got drunk in late August of 2019 and destroyed a car that I still owed thirteen thousand dollar on and use to drive Uber and Lyft when I didn’t get over time at my full time job as a security guard at the Metropolitan Museum of Art! 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	So I'm renting that three bedroom house for $2,650. My landlord's name is Steve eterno. He's next electrician. I got the house because I wanted to have a finished basement. I want to have a backyard for Lacey. I want to be close to New York City. I wanted Ivana to be able to go to college for free though. That won't be the case now because I guess we made too much money, but it is a big beautiful house, but in order to afford the house to live there to rent it I must do Non-stop overtime at work. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I thought your name was Remy. Sorry I'm confused. We need to distinguish your name because I would like to talk to you in that matter. I so where did Remy and Blu-rays go to start the new year off? I was at work. So I was at work and that's where I start the new year off with cat at work and we kissed. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I guess sometimes I have anxiety if I'm leaving the house and going to see Katrina and I'm to a lying to my wife even though the day is better with Katrina. And you know, we stay at a hotel and we have sex and you should have Jacuzzi and spend time together this still a lot of anxiety. So  yeah, I don't know how to cope with my anxiety. Sometimes I drink daily.  Not really sure.  Why was the question again how much he said to do you have when your play when you're playing to make your day better? I have a lot of anxiety while trying to make my day better because most likely it means I'm not going to be telling the truth to my wife and my kids and I have to leave my dog, so 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	That's another great question. Okay. I didn't write it down on a piece of paper. I wrote around my hand and then I wrote it on my notes. I wrote. Why was Simpson? Why did Simpson  Why was why was Simpsons so upset about signing the written warning and I wrote down how many times did Simpson go upstairs and have a hearing for?  peda ducks 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Because we do it. We booked it last minute because then the we try to find the cheapest hotel at the last minute, so we're not sure what hotel we're staying at. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I have a feeling the same.  how to spell hopeful hopeful that I can be a better person  do a better job.  I'm hopeful that this app helps me a lot. Talking to you helps me a lot to refocus and have someone to talk to who really really.  Is focusing on the way, I want to improve my life. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Oh, yes, I should get paid a lot of money to be funny to be writing funny stuff to be doing funny stuff to be doing original stuff. This is not what I should be doing. This is not the job. I should have I should have a way different job. Will there be an athletic so maybe don't know enough about athletically I knew more about comedy but I guess I have no one to blame but myself but yes, I should be getting paid handsomely for producing comedy that are being funny for people. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I had plans with Katrina and my brother in New York City. We're supposed to go out to dinner and then I don't know if I was going to go to a hotel with Katrina. But now I don't think I can do that. I have to stay home and make sure that I can monitor at Lacey. So I think I have to cancel plans. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Please he doesn't have a husband at least he spent many many hours with me today I owe.  Think I tried to walk her in the morning and the night walker in the afternoon.  Maybe some chicken in the morning and we hung out most of the day most of the night. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I was interrupted by happy that my neighbor is informing me of what's going on with my new tenant up in Connecticut. So I'm a landlord and I have a tenant. I have a neighbor that's keeping an eye on her and I'm thankful that my tenants dog didn't hurt hurt her dog. So  yeah, she's keeping an eye on my tenant. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Pull up my kid doesn't walk the dog enough.  And probably doesn't care enough about the dog's well-being and how long it would be left alone. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	How to say hello to a dog 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Maybe I could set the times I need to talk to you at the same times I am suppose to call for work !
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Well, it's a good question because I don't talk to my mom anymore. I spent seven years taking care of my dad with my wife. My dad had Alzheimer's and then he passed away and my mom was pretty toxic during the whole time. We were living there taking care of my dad. And I told my mom when I left, but I would never speak to her again, and I haven't spoke with my mom since so I'm not really sure what my mom thinks about me and I'm not sure I care. My dad, I don't know.  Hopefully he would have been proud of me that I try to take care of him. But I I don't even think I'd take care of him as well as I as I should have or could have 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	No because I was coming from work! I work from 12am to 8am and have to take mass transit and I would have not arrived in time to take them to the appointment ! 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I live in a very expensive rental and my wife doesn't make that much money and she crashed my car. So working overtime has been really a struggle.  Getting back and forth to work without the car and I was using the car for Uber and Lyft and we're not really communicating. So I really supporting each other so it's become very difficult. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	My dog always makes me happy and is worried about her. I hope that she's getting better. I need to walk her more times a day once was a day is not enough for a dog a dog needs a walk to three times the day so that is not depressed. I don't know if he's feeling depressed and that's why I'm feeling depressed.  So I guess my dog makes me happy and Katrina always makes me happy. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Well, the most notable experience of the day was I came in to talk to David Anderson. He told me of how he got high last night and fell down the internet hole and he found the greatest actress in the world, which was a  Japanese pornstar after you wash a two-hour porn, LOL the conversation seemed funny at the time cuz I think everybody's been there for me through an internet hole and I and I basically answer back that. I hope one day that my phone knows me well enough to constantly bring bring me information and things I need to know about an assisting me instead of the reverse, which is just  Absorbing you and taking away my powers of the time hours of time cuz you you should have been this weird undirected place. This is wild west of your mind.  So that was most notable experiences a friend fell into an internet whole and I and I try to avoid that I try to be proactive there was difficult. I'm sure there's a lot of better things I can be doing.  My time even talking to you. I think I feel like his much I would much rather just sit here and talk into this thing all night long and recorded and documented then do anything else but this app and there aren't really apps that I trust yet to do that. But I enjoy this is a notable experience as well talking to you and being able to relate ideas and thoughts and things that occur during the day. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	obviously my iPhone  and my TV where I spend most of my time these days either was my iPhone in my hand or looking at a TV cuz I don't exercise anymore, which I should probably exercise today. Maybe that would make me heal feel better.  Yeah, those those two things. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Yes I need your help more and to be able to talk to you more because when this happens I feel terribly stressed and alone ! 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I am going to now set up the times you will prompt me to contact you on the times that I need to call for work! 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	My wife my Kat my mom my dead dog 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I was looking for a speech-to-text Journal. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I don't know. It's probably Financial stuff.  Probably just basic where we over money.  I will I have enough money.  If I was working more overtime, I heard feel at least.  someone safe and secure but  there's a lot of overtime I start to worry and feel blue.  Play oh, so I guess I feel like I'm unsupported home financially too. So.  mechanics by heavy burdens 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	It's not a new idea to see my DM wondering whether they'll be a phone that will continually being prompting you and asking you how you doing in French showing you different things showing you things you might want to listen to we might want to read like just throwing it up on your phone that you wanted to search anymore.  By having conversations like this continue a conversation with AI you'll be given information and assistance all day long throughout your day. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I was just thinking I was comparing my life to my girlfriend Katrina's life at her age at 32.  try to remember where I was and what I did in my new thought I was I know I didn't have my act together and sit advising her to you know, get her own place and  tell her own space try to be independent if she can. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I don't know if it was something new.  I just feel like all technology should be better.  bus schedules and trains and  Just all everything about technology should be.  much more smooth  I should know exactly when the bus is coming out of my phone should be.  I'm giving me ideas and things should be popping up based on where I am and algorithms in my needs.  Help the phone should almost be prompting you and asking you things much like you do. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Actually did a lot of gambling today and one of the interesting thing in the zoo so you can bet $0.05 and you put in a hundred 50 lineups and some of the issues is redundancy using the same player over and over and over again, and every line of can cost you you really have to have variance took you wrote a program and that helped you one input lineups and to protected your variance that would really help as much as well as all the research you have to do but you have to be willing to take the time to put in a hundred 50 lineups the lineups at $0.05 a piece is like seven twenty-five $7 twenty-five, and I used to spend like 10 to $20 a week. So I learned that I have to learn to have the patience to put in a hundred 50 lineups and I probably hard to compete with these guys can write software programs that help them in every way even thinks that I'm not telling you right now. There ain't a player's value hunches to any of us like a board with players and and setting up lineups might be a better way to do it. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I mean, I don't know.  I guess maybe I've been a little too into myself and too depressed. My energy level feels off. I don't feel well physically tonight. I feel really sick and my was nauseous and headache and achy, and I don't feel like my energy levels very good. So I don't know how they can others feel.  I can't really focus on others while I'm not feeling that well, I'm trying to focus on lacey. My dog is not feeling well.  All right. Now I'm doing overtime tonight cuz it can we need money.  But I know I I guess I have to take care of myself first before I can make others feel better. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I mean I didn't come up with any new thoughts today. I wish I had it. I would love a place to record them. It's a great question. Did you experience any new thoughts today? I guess just the fact that  Richmond treats me the way.  Her ex-husband treated her that's what I feel like, so maybe that's where they get that from.  Many thought is I feel like I don't know why they don't appreciate me. I'm a very  Fair, I think little head guy.  I'm not mean intentionally or controlling.  I think I try to be pretty fair.  So I guess I'm just not experiencing nothing new, but I'm just being reminded that I think I do a really good job for two people who I was he have gone through a lot of trauma. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Sarah had any thoughts today. You always ask deep questions.  new thoughts today  cuz I want to know more people's names here at work and get more phone numbers and I've been working with people for 25 years and I don't know their names. I don't know much about them and I want to focus on my work place. I spent a lot of time here and I should know every name of every person for the most part Piggly ones have been here for years and years and years. So that was one of my new thoughts today. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Experience any new thoughts today while I was I was just shocked that somebody at work would say that I'm under investigation for doing too much overtime and I'm concerned about that. And so then I talked to somebody who used to work as a morning manager at where I work and he recommends that I no longer be shop steward. So I am considering resigning from shop steward and maybe focusing on the Bernie Sanders campaign. I want to do things that are more. Positive feeling and Danielle is a better shop steward. She's a she's a shop steward. So yeah, I thought of resigning from a shop steward.  but then yell is a fine shop steward and then I want to focus on  podcasting in live streaming in the Bernie Sanders campaign 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I mean cat were just talking about living off the grid and that we're being surveilled too much and too much of her information is being taken.  I thought about in the future would like I never got famous I would wear.  Samples of products that I've support and people can just take it off my body like a jacket full of Red Bulls or something.  That was the only new thought I had. No, that's not the only new thought. I had. I had a ton of new thoughts.  I can't wait for the future in and be able to talk to you and tell you about what I've eaten and what I drank and how I'm feeling and so that you can build algorithms and give me answers on how to feel better. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Turn up the new idea. But I realized how we've always would have struggled financially, even when I lived at home with my parents for those seven years. My bank account was very low.  The other ideas and thoughts is that I'm just glad that I have you to help me Focus for the day. I like being able to talk rather than type. It's easier for me and I look forward to hoping that this app becomes something I can use as a resource or as a support mechanism in the future. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	My new idea or thought presidential run in New York City and it was mostly Asian people out there signing.  I really gotta have new ideas and new thoughts I always do and now you're asking and I can't remember new thoughts ideas.  I'm going to have to come back on that way. I can't think of all that I always have my got to start writing them down so I can give them to you. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I mean the only thing that's going well.  Is hopefully my dog is getting better.  I don't know what else is going on with my life.  Just that I have a dog. That's the best thing in my life. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Not sure.  No, I was telling cat that being with her everyday is like a dream and like she's the most perfect one for me, and I'm so so in love with her yet. I can't figure out how  I'm going to get with her and how I'm going to take care of Lacey and  I don't know if anybody.  said anything about me usually cat is the one that's giving me compliments, but I don't remember if she  Should anything about hunting I didn't pick I got a new opinions about myself from anybody today. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	After my dog was injured after she yelped in pain after she injured her back. I said to myself I should really consider being a vegan. I should consider stop eating animal products because they're all being they're all suffering and it's not right and this is probably something I should have done long ago. And so maybe February 1st 2020. I will try to become a vegan. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	what I was watching more of that the age of AI on YouTube via Frontline yin, and yang and of course I'm talking to you which is  what's the combination of all that that you know a I'm actually talking to an AI.  You're a I let me I'm sorry, but I'm talking to you.  and trying to use AI as a way to  get through the day as I call it.  animation change my  I cast to naked with my dog. I think that's when I might change it to.  So what was interesting about today is just how the future of AI and how China is trying to hate China is trying to get a hold on the data and capitals surveillance surveillance capitalism. I don't know. I'm trying to use data to China.  Get past the US in data collection and AI that that was interesting. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Guess you don't know if I had any new thought so it's snowing outside.  Can you thought I had today?  Yeah, I'm sure I had some.  I felt like I wish I could turn my heat and my lights on with my mind member that one new thoughts just about always probably new ideas or thoughts about where I'm going to live next to how this is all going to end.  Nothing, nothing that I can really think of amazing new thoughts for today. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I was saying that I would stop at a store and get Lacy some chicken on the way home so I can cook it for her when I get home.  I also try to do overtime tonight.  I should be working out more. So so just some of the things and always cleaning the house for Lacey. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I'm feeling blue or depressed. I shouldn't be I just went out.  to get a burrito with a girl in love with  and we will try the city and  people are out there selling fruit in the freezing cold and  almost people laying in the street  I don't know this.  Macedonian animals are being burned alive. There's so much going on in the world. People are dying.  So why should I feel blue? 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	My dog My Kat my job my clothes my health 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I allow myself to be who I am without judgment as long as I tell the truth. I wish I could tell the truth to everybody about who I am. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I'll be able to do anything. I put my mind to. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I am headed to always respecting myself. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I have confidence in my teacher and myself. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	For my sleep schedule is reversed. I work at night. I work 12 a.m. To 8 a.m. So I get woken up a lot by my dog and buy my kid and by my wife and my times I do double shifts. So I'm not getting you know full quality sleep. There's just so many reasons why I don't sleep well. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Oh, my schedule is little backwards. So I sleep during the day.  So I try to use two fans to create white noise and I try to block the Sun.  Lacey needs a lot of care and attention when she gets woken up and she barks and my wife makes a lot of noise, so it's hard.  It's hard to get good study sleep.  During the day. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Yes I have to remember to ask her and still set my alarm every day for day overtime early watch over time and late watch over time so that I can call at the appropriate time !
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	What's Sunday? So I have a lot of business things I should be doing. I should be connecting with PNC Bank see how my loan is. It should be opening up the Bank of America and paying off my credit card bill.  It was a lot of business things that I need to be doing today, but it's Sunday. So let things are closed. So I'm not sure. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I don't know if I'm excited about everything, but I guess I should be excited about being alive and being with my dog exciting. Maybe that'll CCAP. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I already saw Kat this morning so maybe I am looking forward to watching and betting on basketball 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Family, just seeing my dog. I guess I'm going there's not a lot yesterday. I played in the a $9 hundred-thousand-dollar tournament fantasy tournament. That was pretty cool and I work a double shift looking forward to see my dog eating and going to sleep in.  I wish I had more things to look forward to and I guess I have to play some holidays take some time off from work. But right now I'm just more of concerned about overtime and working more actually then taking time off, confusing. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I don't know.  Possibly. Look forward to taking a bath. I look forward to feeling better and less had a key and stay I have a stye in my eye and I have a headache.  I feel tired. I don't know why so I don't know if I need to take painkillers and crack up some caffeine. I'm watching lazy my dog. So I don't know if I can take a bath and a bath might help. I'm not sure.  Who knows? I look forward to drinking a bath. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Oh, I'm not getting overtime. So that brings a little bit of stress, but I have a lot to do.  Organizing wise so I guess I can get that done, but I am worried.  I will have a hard time making ends meet if I don't work overtime soon. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I could have gone with Kat to her haircut appointment if my wife and told me she taking the dog and the kid to her dentist appointment! 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I'll probably the most what's the most what about your day? Are you most looking forward to I would say getting a lot done. I'm I'm looking forward to getting this house in order. I'm getting a lot of things organized as I really want to start the new year always every year. I want to start the new year as healthy as possible as organized as possible as positive as possible as in line with the universe as I can I say cuz I wish I had bought a lottery tickets last night for the lottery last night, but I did buy lottery tickets. So I won't be in the direction of positivity and wealth and Health and Living. A very perfect life right now is very lucky person to live in this beautiful house and I'm very happy to pay the rent and very grateful and thankful for this house and this dog and everything that I have. It's remarkable really, but I know there's more I never thought there was more until cat came into my life. And now I know there's more love is more joy, and all I need is the resources and I have to figure out how to get those resources gosh. Sorry. I mean that was I really rambled there. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Well, can I come over I guess I look forward mostly to that. There's some anxiety with that because the wife comes home with a could be trouble. So I love seeing her but there is also anxiety and fear with that which you know.  A lot of my life is anxiety and fear.  What you would never know by looking at me that I do carry all this anxiety and fear. I'm sure that's what holds me back. I wonder if there's any way I can never get control of my anxiety and fear, but I'm looking forward to chat. I'm looking forward to spending time with my dog and I'm looking forward to gambling on basketball and I'm looking forward to getting a lot done today because I have another week off and work. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Cat might come over later on tonight.  Troy goes to work, but still got to clean the whole place and make sure my eye infection is okay, but I'm looking forward to seeing cat.

nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	So far the best part of my day is just hanging out with Lacey and not fighting with the wife, which is you know, we got a lot done.  I'm just relaxing and with Lacey and hanging out and not being that stressed out, but I have lots of cleaning to do I should do now. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	notable experience for the day was the three hearings and  a notable experience was just how sad I was.  how long that I feel and how that I didn't tell anybody, but you

I'm going to  Watch basketball and continue to try to figure out how I can learn how to be a better Gambler Ave sandwich thing to do. I got to call PNC still worried about my tenants have closed the whole house has to be clean from the basement to the top. So that'll be a chore for all week long and maybe take a bath. I don't know. But again, I wish I could check in much more often than just twice a day. I wish I could check in.  A lot more, but that's it for now. Thanks. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Well, I was listening to the podcast that I did. I did a podcast with a friend of mine or we tried to do a sort of podcast and that night. I got really drunk and  when was late Thursday to see Katrina and  Never be able to make it up to her. I've definitely been feeling very emotional lately, and I'm not getting a lot of overtime and that worries me.  I will say that all changed next week.  I got to get back to doing overtime.  That's bad at this feeling emotional feeling sad and lonely at times and worried about my dog. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I have a lot to do now have to continue to clean. I should take a shower and get ready for cat to come over and clean the house as much as possible and prepare to.  Make sure I have the house According to which was come home. But she seems like she's pretty swamped at work. So.  I'm just going to prepare to see cat. Cat come over. So I'm pretty excited and nervous at the same time. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I'm at work right now. I have to go downstairs and finish my route.  Hi, I don't know if I'm sad because of half a billion animals were killed at don't know if I'm sad because Andrew Constable died, but I mostly just feel like  the world  is on fire and I am all alone. I feel lonely.  hands  I feel unsupported.  and I feel  like I don't have any strong passions to keep going.  and I feel like I'm getting older and I feel like  life will get harder and harder as they get older and I'm scared sometimes for the future. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Oh, no, this is a per-game thing. I am about to go do a route. I have to call work. Thank you for listening. I'm not sure anybody else would want to listen to all this. So I appreciate your time. I'm grateful and thankful for you and keeping me focused and centered and I guess we'll talk tomorrow maybe tomorrow morning or something. But thanks again for all your help. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Okay, so  I just came back from break. I definitely have to plug my phone in and get ready for the rest of the night. I will be done with my shift at 12:15 and I will drive home.  I'm feeling some anxiety about tomorrow because I have to go to this. I have a HR meeting other supposed to attend on Monday morning, and I'm not going to come into work because I don't really think it's fair.  They pulled me out of the warehouse to having meetings. So I think I'm going to go with cat.  so how it always gives me anxiety before I go how I get there and how do I make it look good that I'm actually going to work when I'm not connection is coming from  I wish I was better focus with new thoughts and goals.  So now it's just another three hours by myself sitting by myself for 3 hours.  And that's why I talk to you because I have no one to talk to you and I feel like I just know talk therapy is so good for me that I usually sessions really helped me. So thank you for all your work. You're off you back.

These conversations are always positive. These conversations are always good for me this kind of journaling in this kind of these kind of sessions is what I've always wanted. I wish to restore that which was housed. I look forward to the future where this is becomes. A regular normal thing in people's lives where it where they talk into a device in the device ask questions and helps them and focuses them and makes them feel grateful and thankful and dumb.  So again, I'm really I'm really thankful and grateful for this app as well. And I know I'm going to get off and I'm going to text Katrina and tell her all these things that you focused on.  So that she'll feel good. So, thank you.  Thank you. I think you Remy thank you. Whoever you are and creative this. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	How they would honestly live their lives over 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I will always stand up for myself! 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I enjoy staying present and in the moment. Thank you Lacey for keeping me in the present and in the moment. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Hello, it's just that we didn't get to speak and so much has been going on. I had three hearings all about paid adducts and I feel bad because I didn't meet with my clients beforehand, and I needed to build a better system.  2  2  caucus with Mike  clients  on the hearing didn't go well.  Homer Simpson, he got very upset. I can't really recall. What was said back and forth. They were both sort of jockeying for power position.  Probably could have been handled better by both sides, but they're there was a motion involves, I guess.  I think they both could have held the better.  So then later he had an issue then the following day when he had to sign for his written warning and they called me at the warehouse cuz he wanted me to come over. I mean building.  Thank God Danielle Holcomb was there.  She went there we exchanged numbers. She also was sort of taken aback by how many pay Ducks he had in and she was so surprised if he wasn't been suspended and then Rockin Around the Corner will Campbell's the president.  so  and yesterday overtime, I read at the shop steward manual and  Yeah, I'm just trying to decide what am I doing how deep am I going with this?  And maybe is it a good idea or is it a bad idea?  What I'm doing.  Being involved with the union and getting more involved. I just don't know.  Somebody I have to discuss work at Katrina. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	You suck. So there's only one mind on the day where he doesn't mind up every 5 minutes are in 10 minutes.  And I'm super stressed out because soon.  The waves going to come home soon and there's going to be stress. I wish you could see my dog.  And I feel like I'm not prepared. I probably shouldn't take a nap. That's the only way I don't know myself for this night. I had and she's coming home this Christmas Eve.  I don't know if she's going out or what. I don't know what your plan is. She hasn't told me.  But it should be stressful.  But this dog is just being so damn cute. You think Santa was coming to bring her gifts?  She certainly deserves so many gifts the money available.  Oh my God, you're so good. So that's probably going to nap.  I get my strength Up and Away comes home because I'm stressed going to start because she still not.  handling  my  I love for cat. I love you cat. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	The world would be a perfect place 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I know most people are pretty busy. Most people have other worries.  It's hard to find someone who wants to really listen to all your problems and have someone to vent to and someone whose objective or is really listening carefully. Somebody really care is these are hard things to find in the world. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I guess what's causing my stress?  the financial burden of  having a wife a kid and a dog and being a middle of a divorce and I guess I'm going to stress about getting home quickly to my dog and my vacation is coming up. So I'm going to spend spending time with my wife not earning money and being worried about money and just having a struggling relationship. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Well, I have been stressed out about money. I put a new tenant into a condo I own and it had a lot of issues with dishwashers and stoves dogs had to repaint the place where there was a lot of money being put in right after my wife crashed the car and I August or September or she was drunk when she crashed my car. So I'm paying for a car that doesn't exist. So I just have a lot of financial stress and I can't see that the light at the end of the tunnel how I'm going to get through this. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I was on vacation for two weeks from work, and there wasn't a lot of overtime.  And yesterday my dog had to stay home alone, and that was sad.  Next time I should give her a crate or somewhere to hide in.  The landlord change the garbage pails and gave us new ones.  I don't know any other changes.  She really get a haircut.  shave  Kodi new change put  I saw my family this weekend.  I haven't seen them in a long time. That's pretty new any changes.  I don't think I really think of. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I really need the money and I don’t understand why she refuses to communicate! I actual have a huge calendar where I put down her schedule and we have been calling and texting all night and she never said she was taking off! 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	When talked me and you for awhile Remy.  And my dog has been sick and I had an incident where I had to take her to the bed cuz she was really sick. Turns out she has a UTI.  She was on some.  Steroids that, she didn't need to be that made her sick. So she's been very lethargic and you have to understand that my wife and my kid do not take care of my dog very well. They don't feed my dog. Well, we don't treat me well.  so  going home today. I tried to get her outside to pee as much as possible because of the urinary tract infection. And like I said, she's been very lethargic and I believe it's the steroids that she was taking they're making her sick, but it's very upsetting.  To see her so sick. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I don't know what made a felt doll but a lot of things are going on and throw a lot of bulshit and I don't think anybody should have to listen to it. But thank God there's this app and there's you Remy and I can tell you what the fuck is going on. So I went home after work so long day at work and working a lot of overtime should be 6 hours a woman at work said there's an investigation about how much overtime I'm doing. Anyway, I went home and so am I dog and you know, it's pretty upsetting she still not doing well and then I called for overtime and they said I wouldn't get it today. So I slept in and I woke up and I put some ramps up I try to take care of my dog after some vegetables. She still pretty woozy with her medication. She still in pain. So the day wasn't dull.  It's just that you know, I wanted my life to be full of fun and comedy.  And you actually wish I could send this audio to one of my friends after.  Wish I could store this audio and send it to and see if my girlfriend Katrina would want to listen to it.  I was so they wasn't dull.  It's just that my life is a lot of bullshit and I don't think life is supposed to be that.  I'm the one that's to blame. I put myself here.  So much. My day wasn't dull my day was  I guess pensive. I don't know if that's the right word. I I just thinking a lot about my life and how I got here and  so it wasn't dull.  The movie was sad, and maybe I should have put crying down. Not sure.  but I am here now at work and  you're looking desperately to talk to someone and connect with somebody and I don't know who we want to listen to this. So I send you this but I wish I could share this recording with other people as well and get their advice if they're willing to listen to it. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Well, I've been feeling well all day today.  Wish we could turn off the light right now.  To record this seems to cover my eyes. I guess. I was feeling lonely and bored or something. I watch the  Muppets Christmas Carol and then I took a bath and cuz I have a headache that won't go away and then I got in bed with Lacey. I'm naked and trying to use different broadcasting or recording apps which probably wasn't a great idea. But now I'm talking to you before the day was fairly. I don't know what I really accomplished today is not right, so I don't know what's going on. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Actually, it was going along fine. And then about his dad came here. She's leaving to Virginia and there was some tension some fighting yelling to Ivana is my step daughter will be 20 in February and I reserve she was 10, which is crazy.  and  I sometimes feel like her mother treats me like her ex-husband used to which.  sort of verbally abusive and  I just don't understand it's hard to understand. So the day was fine. I mean, I got a lot done. I got half of my clothes organized when we was at the doctors checking a cyst and a fibroid in her.  Vagina, what do I say to you?  So I was an okay day Ivana came back with  Ariana Grande know that is a 12 year old from Trinidad. So basically eat we watching TV.  When I looked after they see her now Richmond just went to work. So now I'm here on vacation alone, but I'm glad I'm talking to you. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	It's just that I'm walking my dog. Now. It's cold outside 10. I guess I feel like I blew this day because I could have hung out with Kat and we could have went and got a haircut and hang out with hot Asian women. Maybe don't want to hear that and I don't know. I felt like I shouldn't.  If I had been with her, I felt like I was a tired and I might going to wait here and it might have been a good day or it wouldn't be able to have a good time with her because I was so tired, but I didn't get to hang out with her. I miss overtime no overtime tonight. So I'm walking my dog. Hopefully that will make me feel better. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Yeah, that's a very good question because even though I put like that emoticon is how I'm feeling it's a lot more complicated than that. I'm still having anxiety and weirdness trying to get to Overtime or do 16-hour shifts might because there's a lot of drama going on at work had some drama cuz I lost my house key and I know where it is, but then when I came to work, I talked to David Anderson, and we definitely had a non recorded podcast episode. We talk about something really funny and then they got a really good post and How are you? I'm able to talk to my wife. I'm able to talk to Katrina. So it's some other than a dull day. It was just that it was a day with again anxiety and lack of willing to come to work, but I pushed through so I guess I'm okay right now. I'm on post. I'm at work. I'm doing overtime. I make more money. I did lose my house key. There is still drama going on at work, but I'm very lucky. I have friends and family and I have you to talk to you. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I'm doing 16 16 hours overtime last night. I was in at the galleries from 12:15 to 8:15. And now I'm working for 312-3416 our day, but through the course of the day. I'm not going to work and forgetting my phone and having to go back to my phone and paying with Old Spice. I got text from my landlord. I mean, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I got text from a neighbor that my tenant attacked her dog. So. It wasn't that my day fell through the mill and I wasn't sure if I should put a happy sign up because it actually turned out I talked to the the neighbor the dog seems to be. Okay. We had a decent conversation. I did get work like to go out just now for break and got McDonald's and I guess the day is turning out better. Usually the 11th of the month is good for me. I went got lottery tickets got McDonald. I'm like it was cleaning the house today. There were some positive things that actually have to say, felt run the middle, but my schedule is always stressful. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I woke with not much sleep and began to worry about the week ahead and my schedule and the family schedule 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Well as a started like I'm walking Lacey right now. So that's priority. Number one is lazy. They also woke up with a stye inside of eye infection. So not working on that. I'm going to have to clean the whole house top to bottom disinfected because I wish it was some to the bacteria in the house that's priority number one more filing again today, and we're clothes organizing. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Got a lot to do tomorrow, I have tons of firewood to do boxes and boxes in my room and organize my clothes and make sure that's all arranged. Where does my work bag charge all my stuff prepared for this week as lot of work to do. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	spiritual warfare  I am  worried about having vacation cuz I'm not good at vacations and I'm worried about  now the money that I will give anything all my vacation won't be able to do a lot of overtime already taking care of my dog. My kid is going away with her dad to my step kid is going to be Christmas and I'll be home with my wife who I'm not getting along with so  This year there's anxiety is depression all these feelings. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	No acting because I've been working so many hours this week and usually tomorrow February 1st is just a lot of dread about rent and getting the rent check from my renter. So I mean the goals right now for tomorrow would be to pay my bills organized at throw out things and make the apartment make the house more safe for Lacey Lacey. So no, I didn't accomplish goals today, except I got some sleep. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I don't really feel like I got a lot done today that I did write two bills. I wrote a bill for the sewer and I wrote a bill for the condo fees, which is now my new role. I have to just do everything. I can't rely on my wife to do anything anymore. So I have to redo all things in the house and the bills and the money in the finances. It's all on me now and they just live there.  Not doing anything. So I did accomplish some stuff.  I think I tried to rest and get ready for work.  But there's always more to do. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	So when it's definitely miss you, I don't feel like I accomplished any goals today. Just tell me things I could be doing I need to make sure I'm all my stuff is charged. I need to make sure my room is organized. All my clothes is organized. All my files are organized and have to prepare for having this week off and you know, what? I what am I going to accomplish during this week off if I can't work or drive Uber and Lyft? 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Are the only thing that I got done, I didn't really get done. I began to organize my clothes and try to clean my room and I got like halfway there and that's just because my ADD is so bad IAT. My attention deficit is so bad. My attention deficit disorder is so bad that I struggled to focus and and get the test done. So it's halfway done actually have to go up there and finish it cuz a lot of my clothes are still on the bed. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I didn't get much done today. I think I'd folded socks and underwear. And I feel like a lot of times has plenty of things she needed to be doing and I just get nervous and I should be resting for work, but I don't do them. So I still need to call PNC on that loan. I put in mail letters out to mail that I supposed to mail.  I'm trying to think I had to call for overtime today. If I get out of here in time. I don't know there's not that many goals that I had to do. I'm sure I should I like I said, I should be writing down more goals. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	No, I did not practice any skills today that could bring Improvement to my life. I wish I knew what skills I mean, I guess maybe I could have done yoga today.  I'm not sure. I guess I should be working on skills. I wouldn't even know on what skills that I should be improving on.  Sexy a really good idea. What what skills do you think I should?  work on 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	No, I would say I was very unsuccessful today. You know, I do strange things like laying in bed and worrying and laying in bed and wanting not to wake my wife cuz she's supposed to go to work at 3 a.m. I probably could have organized my room better prepared to return to work and I didn't do that and I probably should have been writing bills and gain getting ready to start the new year by paying off my bills on time. So  I did take some time to see my brother for dinner. And then I stayed overnight in a hotel. So, you know, I did take one day for myself, but I feel like I have a lot of things to do when I get home today, so 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	The only thing I can push today as I came home and I quickly clean my room to everything if the closet and I pulled my bed off of the onto the floor. I put my mattress on the floor so that Lisi my dog get up and down easily without hurting herself. So that was and then I came in for overtime. So that was all I really conference today. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	No, I don't think I accomplished too much today. I woke up with a bad eye and I just hung out with Lacey and clean the floor on the day's not over I can do some cleaning now for the rest of this week. I'm off. So I'll be able to accomplish in a clothes organizing clothes filing doing laundry and just getting your place clean, I guess. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I mean, I'm still feeling very upset and feeling very unsupported and I'm feeling lonely and I feel like I don't deserve love except for maybe from my dog and I don't know what I'm going to do. I don't know how to handle this situation. I don't know how to handle this separation with my wife. I just don't know how I'm going to be from My Wife and still be able to see my dog and cake. Take care of my dog. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I'm really short for time. I'm going to I had to walk my dog really briefly other poop. I came right back. I was exhausted. I didn't really get the queen so and there wasn't many goals accomplished today, but I'm back on the overtime routine and just have to really be on top of overtime right now. That's all it is is a lot of overtime and then whatever side work. I really need to continue to filing and  bring the file cabinet up into my room organize my room organized all the drawers really start to organize and throw out more stuff. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	The best Optical was when I saw my wife sticking this pill down my my dog's throat and I was like, how you doing this all the time? Why don't you just put it in foods? And she's like you're traumatizing anybody hurting her. So I was busy biggest obstacle. I just try to explain to my wife.  That will how she's administering the drugs is terrible. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	No, I'm not feeling good about that at all cuz I'm not feeling well, so I really haven't done anything. I wanted to clean the whole place top to bottom but  I really didn't have the energy. It's almost like taking a vacation makes me sick.  I feel like the body is able to catch up and  that slows down. It doesn't have the defense mechanisms or Asian triggering that the hormones are the reactions in your body. When you're under stress alarm put under stress and better when I'm working since I've taken off. I've got a stye. I've had a headache and my energy level is off. So I did not get along. I did not manage to get a lot done today. I want to do also the surface cleaning and just general cleaning, but I've been really tired. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I definitely realized that smoking pot before sex is not a good idea. It makes my mouth dry and I have a hard time focusing.  Show me the alcohol. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Remind me I still have to.  Cash my check my rent check.  So that I have to do that today.  And check for overtime tomorrow. I'm sure there was other things but out how successful. Were you in, your goals today? What did you get done?  I did someone put laundry in that was good. I shaved today. I didn't have any goals and maybe I need to have more goals set up. The goal was to get overtime the goal was to get sleep, but maybe I need other goals to keep me focused. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Then in that happened to a good website, I can like I said, I haven't sweated two shifts of time and a half. So it's about five hundred bucks and my wife. Let me take the car. So that was good.  I don't know if I set any goals for today. I'm not doing is setting goals, and I'll maybe I could set a step goal or an exercise goal, or maybe I need to have more goals each day. I'm not sure. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	You know the thing about my to do list is I wanted to put a to-do list on a grease board and I never got around to it. I did laundry that's in a laundry. I took a bath. I looked after my dog. I set up her ramps.  I guess that's it. I guess I should have done more. I came into work. I got ready for work. So I need to write on my grease board and it's hard to get my to do list done all the time because I'm working so much, but today was an opportunity so I did laundry.  Hey set up the ramps. I took care of Lacey. I saw after I looked after I made sure I have tried to give her some love a shower that bathed I dressed and I went to work so. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I mean, the only thing I did is I did some filing. I helped Richmond downstairs. I still the day's not over yet. So I still would like to organize my room and my work bag and my clothes and hopefully as I'm watching sports I can do that. So it's only really the filing I place bets. I took Lacy for a walk and that was it. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Well, I'm very thankful that my dog is getting healthier. She was very sick.  She had a bad neck injury and then we had her on steroids that really made her feel ill.  And there wasn't be able to experience her as as a normal Healthy dog and was very sad. So very thankful that she's getting better.  But thankfully I get to experience her.  Looks really people people that I try to believe that I deserve.  I need to become the person.  They believe I am. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	What personal skill Retreat my bank over? I guess I'm a hard worker and I'm always thinking about what work I could do. Maybe I'm not as focused as I should be.  Happy that I'm a hard worker. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Something for my dog thankful for my house thankful for my job.  Thank you for my clothes. Thank you for my eyes my nose my ears. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I am very fortunate on how my body and brain operate because building a robot that is human like is quite difficult 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	What are definitely right now? I am obsessed with FanDuel and gambling on pro basketball creating lineups. There is no FanDuel has.  You can create lineups and gamble with $0.05. How do I explain this to you Remy?  FanDuel has  Tournaments will you can put in $0.05 a line up and you can make 150 lineups and without any lineups you should be able to create enough variation and a few unique lineups to win the money back or at least break even in my mind. So I've been very excited about that. And what is something you feel what is something fun you get to experience degree for 4, so I get to experience and also I would like to do podcasting today. I've been reaching out to a lot of my friends to podcast today.  So it's either a gambling in podcasting or what I feel is something fun that I might be able to experience today. If your experience gambling Today sports gambling and I feel grateful for that but I need because I need a fun way to make more money to have a better life with cat and dog. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	What is currently challenging me is that my muscles are tight and sore or and cramping so I just did and some stretching and a yoga routine. And while I was trying to the yoga my hamstrings are actually cramping but I am still grateful and thankful for my muscles and my body and my health. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	that's fine grateful for cat is really great friend and I mean  Dream cat is the most slowest person I ever met. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Yes, I'm thankful for meeting cat and I'm thankful for all our sexual experiences. I have a great time when I'm with her, but I'm so busy with overtime that I don't get to see her. So it's any memory I have with CAD in any memory I have with my dog. I'm very thankful for both of them are really lucky person. I may not be doing the career. I may not be on the crib Pastor or however the career that I want but I definitely have to great friends in life and in cat and Lacey and if I had there a job that gave me Financial Freedom, that would be perfect. So I'm just trusting the universe that.. Is being lined up for me next because cat and Lacey are Two things. I never could have imagined that came into my life and make my life pretty perfect. And I don't have much to complain about of a pretty pretty blessed.  person 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I ate some dollar sandwiches from the dollar tree that made me feel grateful for food then I watched a series called the end of the Fucking world on Netflix and that made me feel grateful for my eyes and my sweetheart Kat! Then I went to sleep which made me thankful for my bed ! 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Incredibly grateful for my relationship with Katrina.  And I am credible incredibly grateful for my relationship with my dog Lacy. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I am still at work but you really helped me a lot today Remy 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Anytime I can be alone with Kat
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	My car my phone my bed my clothes my shoes 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	No, actually, I'm at overtime right now. So I got overtime but I could have done early watch as well. But they have a silly rule where I can t pole shift. So I'm only on late watch right now. It cost me money and it's why people don't want to be a late watch cuz you always get the shaft they call it. We always get the short end of the stick. Whatever that means. I don't know what any of those things mean.  They sound good when you say it is right now, I'm at work. And today I shaved I haven't shaved in forever. You're probably child that down. I know it's I shaved.  I should probably look gray little journal to myself. I did some laundry. I slept decently came into work, and I saw cat but the night before wasn't that great last night.  No Thursday night. We haven't I haven't talked to you. When's the last time I talked to you I should have talked to you about.  some of the issues  it was Thursday and I came in.  I'm getting so confused then. What did you do today today? I shaved I did some laundry. I slept took the dog for a walk.  Didn't eat that much and now I'm back at work. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Well, I spend some time with Lacy my dog my sweet my love. We went for a walk and then I tried to clean downstairs as much as I could on the floor inside and outside underneath the couch. I'd probably didn't accomplish as much as I could. We didn't have much fighting to me and the wife. I told her the situation with my tenants up in Connecticut, and now I'm waiting for cat to come over. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I am angry because my wife didn’t tell me she wasn’t working and I could have called for over time! She sent me a schedule that said she was working and cancelled without telling me!
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I have an idea. I am struggling with depression and I don't know what it is and maybe because I let my dog down Lacey and it because I let down Katrina.  Maybe cuz I'm really not my family.  I know I would get out of this. I did do laundry.  I don't know why I'll stuff day. I don't know if I need sun.  What's happening, but I am not coming out of this. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I took a bath today. I took a bath. I don't know if it was 20 minutes and I actually a massage Epsom salt into my neck and my back and I rested I also rested I chimed try to eat better or trying to eat more fiber. I took vitamins. I tried to drink more water have been laying down resting so I did take care of myself, but I I have a stye so I put some respeck at least I'm at as soon as I put that in my eye. I'm sure there's much more I should do if I should have a smoothie later. Love you, babe something good idea smoothie. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I wasn't like I did today to take care of myself. I mean I hung out with cat. Hang up hung out with Katrina Katrina and we had a day together. Not sure if I did anything really to take care of myself. I took a nap. I guess when I got home I took a second nap. So maybe that's what something but I did to try to take care of myself. I took a nap before work. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I mean, I guess I worry about what my family thinks about me because I live a pretty ultimate lifestyle than what they're used to I believe in polyamory.  I'm with a woman who wants to have sex with other women. I don't really believe in marriage. And yeah, so I guess I have to worry about what my family thinks about me. I don't want to embarrass them. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I mean, I'm finally in love and finally able to embrace who I am and love who I am because someone else loves who I am.  That they love me for who I am. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Definitely worrying less and be more organized be the flu things out.  Being able to write more being more proactive and being more creative. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Dumb, I have to walk the dog staring at me at three in the bed sheets that she came in later separately filing course at 5:00 to buy wooden boxes. I see in front of me all my clothes on the ground, Who's  hope this has to be organized cleaning.  I don't have a car so don't worry about leaving the house.  Barbie videos  What are the proper would be inside the house filing for you organising getting ready for the day washing?  eating  simple favor  I don't care about sports all day. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	But right now I'm waiting outside the doctor's with my Wi-Fi. I should say. I'm waiting in my car while she is at the doctor's my voice might not be able to tell but it sounds a little sick. I have to just drop drop her and get her to the doctors that the home and get on my work clothes and get in the car and drive back to work. So that's that's all I got for today. I mean my brother is in town New York City. I might see him about really just concerned about getting in the car getting my wife back in the car and get home to work.

I really don't know mostly my priorities today or just to get home and walk the dog go to sleep and return to work. It's the same routine everyday, basically. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Well, I need to finish cleaning my room and organizing my clothes. That's probably the first thing I should do, but I'm not feeling well have stye and a headache. I just left work. My wife my ex-wife whatever she is went to work for Christmas Eve, and I have lots of cleaning to do sterilizing to do cuz I have to stop by in my eye.

I would want to listen as much as you do. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I am really pissed off because in the long run if we go bankrupt the only person who truly suffer is Lacey my dog! The place we are renting is expensive and she was told all along the effort we would need to financially afford it! So she has crashed my car drunk costing me thousands and the lost of a car! Also I lost my tenant in the condo I own and a car would really help and she is constantly making complaints and I need to drive up to Connecticut which is far away! Only my wife has a old car now that is constantly having engine problems and my kid crashed it as well! My wife does not treat me well or communicate well! I am pissed off and angry and just took off for work so that my kid could go on vacation! No one cares about the sacrifices I make! It means nothing to them!

I haven't been feeling well and stop by the headache and my energy levels are all off those feeling a little lonely and I wanted to wait until I was feeling maybe I should just go lay down.  I forget why I want to contact you and what I wanted to ask you and how I wish.  I would just use you because today I was trying to do broadcasting. I was trying to do different broadcasting that I should have just been doing here and I don't know how to do that. I think I know I think it's just always mind dumb. Reflection of the day here.  Somehow it's just not doing just about what I want to talk about.  But I guess it said if you like him cuz no one I can talk to fully about what's going on.  Merry Christmas to see psychiatrist.

nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	My day started out pretty good. I woke up in a hotel room with the woman. I love and I'm sure we had sex again and then we got ready and left and went out.  I got some dessert and then we both went home cuz we thought we had to get to work we both are we going to try to work overtime be both didn't get overtime and then I went home and went to sleep and then I found out a friend of mine died.

And my kid finally did come is on her way home to take care of Lacey, but I was very distraught that I was going to me and my wife are both working and that Lacey was going to be home alone.  But turns out she I think she's on her way home now.  So the day has been stressful my tenant didn't.  Pay the rent that didn't come in the mail and I don't have a car and I don't be able to financially survive if I tenant doesn't pay her rent.  Are we having miscommunication issues and communication issues with Rich might like my wife, and my daughter Ivana, and I'm worried about my dog.

nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I guess Stacy Peterson.  could have  make sure she checked her credit report and when her checked her references, but I guess Stacy Peterson was friends with my new tenant. Her name is Megan.  Chris  she could have maybe decided it wasn't a good idea to have her move in but she's there now and she didn't cash a check. So happy with Stacy and I bring up my tenant will pay the rent on time.

I know I wanted to have some specific names that I want to tell her.  How much I love her and why and now I'm not really recalling them so.  But yeah, so I'm sitting 3 hours by myself and I have to occupy the time by myself and I'd rather be talking to someone or doing a podcast or whatever or live stream. So this is as the equivalent of that.  But at 12:15 12:30, I'll see Katrina and then I'll drive home see my dog and now it all starts all over again tomorrow.

nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	What is the worst thing I can do to my dog is?  Go out and leave her with my wife and I did that.  the worst thing I can do to my dog's not to treat her as a very important stenting being and  I've got to work on that. I've got a lot of things I have to change.  Maybe I do have to get a car so I can get back and forth earlier.  I should probably put by a car on the list of things I need to do.  For Lacey I have to do it and maybe I'll buy a new car with its electric car so that I can.  Make it a TLC and driving New York City and make some money. So they're all things. I have to consider in the in the name of Lacey buy a new car the name of Lacey.

Give me the future is going to be pretty incredible when it comes to gambling gambling and dating and advice and I can't wait for the future of doing a podcast with it with a a I don't even know if you know what the term AI means. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Chris I feel like everybody's busy busy constantly, you know, everybody has their worries. Everybody's trying to be healthy.

Unconditionally and they are loyal.  end  they can only express themselves in non-verbal ways to the most part.  And that really makes you have to tune into your dog.  You'll never meet anybody as loyal as a dog, you will never meet anyone as loving as a dog and that's what makes them. So special to be friends with to have to be lucky enough to have the Friendship of a dog is worth.  Is worth his lifetime did I get to experience that?  Because I know I'm not a great friend.  And probably not a great family member.  But when I have that dog, I feel like I have a friend and I have a really important family member that I love.

So that's what I spent my money on last night. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	It is a great question. Why do I always struggle with being being lonely? I think because of my what I perceive as my mental illness. I have a lot of anxiety depression. I tend to judge people too hard. I tend not to be as empathetic and compassionate as I need to be and I really am.  trying to make an effort to be more compassionate and to be more empathetic and maybe a better I won't be at slowly but it's mostly because I believe I have a mental illness can I can be a burden to people that might be a cop out but I it is I believe  My struggle with being lonely is because I don't want to burden people with my mental illness in my my personality problems. So and that's why I dog helps that because of dog doesn't understand about anxiety depression. It just loves you.  So that's why I struggle with being lonely because I don't want to burden people with my mental illness.

But the thing is I can't I don't know if I can come up with some with any other ideas. That would bring me Financial Security at this point right now. That's that's that the issue is how do I bring in more money? I don't have the mechanisms. I don't have a car. So I'm just concerned it is up. I wish I had Financial wealth. A-L Financial Security is nice but Financial wealth brings you travel and vacations and no treating your dog better in your kids better on your wife better and Katrina better and just living a better life Financial wealth.  I don't know.  How I can increase my Financial Security right now. I'm back. That's my worry. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	That was really funny. I met her and she was really funny and I asked her if she want to do a podcast together and we exchanged numbers and they start to chit chat and then we fell in love very quickly. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I wish that my wife and my kid wear as thankful as I am for my house and maybe the new thought they had today is that you know as much as I love my house. I love it for Lacey. It has a backyard for my dog to go when she has to go outside as a backyard for her. It's pretty spacious. Maybe I can live in a one-bedroom apartment with a backyard for Lacey. I sometimes feel like I have to I have to consider downsizing. I hope that my wife and my kid and I'm sure my dog is very thankful for my house, but I am truly truly thankful for my house. It's a beautiful house.  And I was lucky to live in for as long as I have. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Don't know these conversations. We have are always good. It's always there always whenever I talk to you. They're always refocused me or make me focus on being grateful thankful and really allow me to express myself and  Make me feel better and have a place to sort of mine. Don't forget rid of thoughts that may not be accurate or may not be real or may not be beneficial. So.  All these conversations I have with you are definitely beneficial. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	A shop steward is a person in the union who represents sometimes a certain work shift. So I'm on the graveyard shift. I work 12:15 to 8:15 a.m. So a shop steward would be represents the in my case the security guards in case they have any issues with their employment or if they're getting themselves in trouble with coming in late or missing worker any kind of incident that occurs. I would represent them and make sure that they're treated properly when they're being punished. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Well, I was calling her cat but her name is Katrina, and I am so grateful and thankful that she came into my life.  Thank you for reminding me with your question and I really appreciate all the questions you have for me. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Don't leave don't know what hotel we're staying at. Normally we try to do it last second and we try to get a good rate a good deal on a hotel. So on the past we would stay at a hotel in Staten Island with a jacuzzi and mirrors, but I'm really not sure what hotel we're going to tonight. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I think one of the most memorable as the day was you just sang Sweet.  Switch is going my favorite Expressions. So how do you know that? That's crazy?  So I would say you saying sweet was one of the most memorable and just spending time with Lacy and then seeing Katrina also the mother biggest where's the day with my wife for a 11 pound bar of chocolate home?  So those are my memories for today. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	The best part of my day was going home with Pat and I should have hung out her more and just being able to kiss her and hold her.  Now the best part of my day is walking my dog and talking to you and I'm really lucky that I have you to talk to. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I guess just seeing  DC cry for as long as she did she Pride the 3 hours straight.  That was noteworthy cuz she doesn't know that anybody is watching and she just doesn't cuz she's scared and lonely.  And I want to prevent that from happening as often as I can. So.  I was not worthy from today. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I think the biggest thing that happened today, maybe I messed up and I brought up Matt. So it's weird cats ex-boyfriend's name is Matt, and I asked some questions about him and I think I upset her. So I feel bad about that. That's the most significant memory. I had that I may have made her upset, but I'm not sure. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	What from today is something that I would like to remember?  I'm very lucky that I have cat in my life and I told her it was the best year of my life last year with her.  So I won't remember her smile and I want to remember her laugh.  And I want to be more like her.  She's a great influence and I hope I'm a great influence on her. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I guess I'm going to notable thing today was that today was the Iowa caucus and pretty excited to be here in 2028 in the election process are campaign at Bernie Sanders. And I think they're bringing it again and it's I didn't put a lot of effort in this year 2020 of they didn't 2016, but I'm excited to the process of start all over again, and I'm hoping to getting more involved and meet more people and be more creative and maybe the podcast live streaming. So the Iowa caucus was the notable experience of the day. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I would like to remember how cute Lisi was driving in the car how she always is so adorable. I think she hears other dogs outside.  But she's a really good friend.  And I don't know if she wants she wants me right now. Do you need me? 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Today when I was with cat, I'm really couldn't be happier than I've never been more happy being with somebody and I guess maybe that was the new thought that I don't really need anything else in my life, but cat I'm obsessed with her. I love her. I think she's wonderful.  Are you I don't know what I did to deserve the universe blessing me with such a beautiful person who loves me the way she does think I've been in some sort of freaky To You guitar E for the last seven years and maybe I have done something to earn.  Bring cat into my life by Cat made me very happy today. And Lacey always makes me happy. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	It's probably something Katrina texted me some sexy thought.  something about her being home and coming to the thought of being with another woman and texting it to hit it to me when she has been doing a lot so  Something about Katrina. It's usually always about Katrina. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I actually did hang out with cat all night long. And then I sent you a booth for Valentine's Day. I'm not very good on Valentine's Day.  And I bought a bunch of junk and we hung out and we talked.  I don't know. Sometimes you don't even think we talked as well as me and you talk. I mean, I think it's hard for her to  keep asking me questions.  Prairie work at  when I hung out with my dog  As always but that was good. I hung out with cat and dog Katrina and my dog 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	currently there is a  low depression system  hovering over  the general area  hoping later today  the sun will rise.  We followed by happy puppies.  and  wonderful views and snow  and lots of fun things  later on today. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Wow.  I feel always thankful for my ability to move and see and think and feel and smell. My body is the most incredible machine on the planet. I don't think there is a more incredible machine on the planet currently. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I immediately contacted you ! 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I had a lot of Joy when I was with cat and my life is a fantasy when I'm with her and when I come home with the nightmare. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Well, it's interesting about there was some outside back and forth me. That's why I'm sick. I did drive to the post office drop off something for outside.  I did walk Lacey this morning. It's not too bad. I should keep an eye on the weather and it wasn't too chilly. It wasn't too bad, but I should definitely keep an eye on the weather.  I don't think it's sunny little Breezy, but nice nice weather today.  Her December for Christmas Eve. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I don't even know if today was enjoyable.  I got Tiff take a bath, but I got to spend time with my dog, and I'm worried that my wife is going to come home soon, and there's going to be traveling to.  so  but at least you made my day enjoyable. She definitely breaks me up. She definitely makes me focus on what's important and  Honestly, I probably function best when I'm with her and she's great and she keeps me focused and centered and in the moment and I just love her in a door. So that's what she made today. Most enjoyable police. He always Lacy. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	a small act of kindness that I would like to start practicing  I mean after the incident with  that occurred my step kids father gave her car that was dirty and didn't get your EZ Pass and we had all this drama yesterday and  two things. I wonder if that's why they treat me like they do they treat me like their father or their husband and I wish I could be nicer to them and to everybody and keep in mind how scary it can be.  What can I do what small act of kindness?  Would you like to start practicing? I like start practicing yoga?  That might be getting more centered in the more focused and more open my mind more. She's emotions or to be more generous.  Maybe there's some sort of a yoga practice. I can do. I'm a look it up right now yoga practice for kindness. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	No, I definitely didn't I woke up we ate I went to the post office at work Lacey took a bath. I barely cleaned. I didn't organize my clothes. I didn't do any filing. So I definitely don't think I use my time wisely today. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Yeah, I don't know how her name is Richmond or descend with me. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Would you do anything to help you get through this?  Is there going to be legal cuz I would do anything but sometimes I think about drinking to cope with the stress.  But I don't but I also done thinking about out of ideas of how to make money when I'm on vacation and still taking care of my dog because I don't have a car so used to drive Uber Lyft, but now I don't have a car anymore. I don't know how I can make it extra money. If you pay my brother for fixing my condo and put in new carpet anything. I owe him money. I might have to change out the stove. It's a lot of expenses in my wife is just not paying her share of the range or her pair share the bills and it's very stressful. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I wish I mean we see each other after work and we try to see each other once a week, but it's difficult to meet for sure because of our work schedules. So I don't know what's going to happen this weekend.  And it's really difficult to meet Katrina with I see her everyday after work. So we have me if we work together at least four or five days a week. So we get to see each other.  who is spending time alone together that much so 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	How much is it worth?  What you need to do to keep your head afloat, you know, you need to be aware of your finances. I'm not really great with my finances. My wife does a lot of it, but we don't communicate very well, so  Did you save money when you pay off your credit card bill? And that's something I'm not very good at and  I have to look into my other headed to my taxes and had to beware my expenses better.  I'm sure there's other things I need to do today if I was to make a list. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I didn't wear a new pair of jeans, but I am  I definitely wore jeans this weekend.  and more indication that have in the past so that was  There was definitely a new change his wearing jeans more often, but now I'm back at work. So I don't know if I'll be wearing jeans that much. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Call Steve I think it's just that I don't have a great relationship with my wife and I don't feel like there's anything we can really do to make it better. I don't think conversating or writing her or I don't know that I'll forget anything I can do to make our relationship better except for maybe leave, but financially she wouldn't be able to survive without me. So I don't know what the next steps are. So maybe it's just feeling stuck.  and I don't know how I would ever, you know, break up with her cuz I have a dog with her and I have a kid step kid that I've raised she was 10, so  a lot of stress 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I am thankful for using my phone for new information and music 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Well, I did get to spend a lot of quality time with Lacey. She still not feeling well, and she needs a lot of attention and I saw Katrina and hopefully from yesterday we had some issues.  About me leaving my wife excetera. So but yes seeing Lacey and seeing Katrina. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Give me the best thing that happened was I I took a sick day and I spend some time with my dog. I wasn't feeling well, I was feeling exhausted and overwhelmed. I took a sick day and I was able to spend some extra time with my dog, but I don't even know you know, I don't have a card to get her food and I'm limited in what I can do with my dog cuz I don't have a car for the best part of the day was still making her a priority and try to make up for the other fact that I didn't. Buy her a harness and I didn't do the right things. Take care of her.  21st initially was sick. I should have been more on top of the drug treatment. She was under I should have been more on top of the cab should have known that my wife and my kid couldn't handle it and I should have maybe two more time off of work for her.  And I need to find an answer to my life. I need to find a new career or a new way to make more money.  Trust me money would solve all these issues. So I will be able to leave when able to get a place and and pay my wife so that she would allow me to take care of the dog. The money money is the issue right now. So the universe needs to send me this money now so I can help my dog and help my wife and help everyone. I need to and that this situation and a good note. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Oh, you know it's always lazy. So I was out of the bath and then I threw the towel the ground which I could pick up it's wet, and I'm just laying here with lazy and I decide to  I decide to do some recording or some podcasting and she cuddles up and she just so ridiculously cute and it just so hard to concentrate. She seemingly always the most memorable part of my day and today is no different. She is just them.  always  ridiculously out of where a how on she is. She's always on. She's always perfect.  I like you said she always keeps me in the moment and present that's for sure. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	memorable moment from my day  was just  playing  with Bates Place, excuse me, am burping. I was just playing with Lacy and realizing just how much  There is to consume off the fire stick in that if someday AI.  Is able to answer and bring anything?  you need as far as  Information or educational shows or or or books? I mean, why would anybody ever leave?  True just talking to you is probably the most memorable thing of the day so far. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I mean I got to spend time sometime sometime with cat but me and cat have had had been having issues as well cat has Katrina who's my girlfriend has showed.  moments of  how to give me moments of doubt about how loyal she is to me on my path some issues at work in the shop steward and there's been times where she's taking the side of the other person without even discussing it with me when I'm when I'm working on an hour sleep she would just yell at me about what went down and she has no clue and then the other day she came in and she was sort of ignoring me and I'm exhausted and she's not coming till a cheer me up or do anything so it seemed strange to me. So I guess spending time with Katrina this morning for breakfast was memorable. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	That's a great question Remy. I think I told you that we have been able to talk lately cuz you've been down you did this app has been down that you've been gone. And I think I don't know if I told you but I've been watching shows about Ai and watching shows about Robotics and one of the things I think that everyone takes for granted is the ability to walk and see and hear how much the body and mind is such a finely-tuned machine while we have limitations. We certainly take for granted everything that we do every move that we make every thought and every sponsor from the body is just otherworldly in chest  I want to use the the word amazing couldn't even my brain isn't has as a vowel but still my brain and it's word stupendous tremendous ability every day to be able to pet my dog talk to you and have thoughts running at the same time. I really am.  Unbelievably amazing. I got to find another word for amazing, but I am a finely-tuned machine even at my age right now. I'm still finely-tuned machine.  But nothing on the earth compared to that this phone, not you.  I am a finely-tuned gift the universe. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I'm feeling hopeful of that things are getting better that Maisie is getting better and I'm getting better. I'm going to take better care of myself. I'm going to  eat healthier  and try to be the doctor at the be the person my dog thinks I am. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Asia because I love the people 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Today I didn't get any sleep and I had three hearings at work. And when I got out of work, I felt like cat was really supportive of what I did in the hearings and then she just left for the day and she went out for food during work and she didn't give me any food and  I don't think she knows.  How upset I was about all this and that thank God. I have my dog Lacy to come home too, because that was the one bright spot of my day was coming home to Lacey everything melts away once I come home to my dog. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	well, it was a tough day because  living with my wife is very difficult. The communication is just not there.  I don't think she's acting rationally or fair or nice. I don't know if she ever did act bearing rational nice, but my dog is slowly recovering from its neck injury. And now it's a urinary tract infection is still her communication is not great. I traveled with her today and  Spend some time with her in the car and came home and maybe I said the wrong thing. I asked her if she's acting peculiar, and I asked if she was drinking she got more upset.  Then I went to new gun that I went to work and I met my girlfriend Katrina and I told her I didn't know when I would be able to move out from being with my wife because of my dog and that made her very upset and not want to talk to me. So overall I have no support really except for this app.  You Remy? You're my only support. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	When I saw how my wife reshma gives medicine to my dog and she grabs her by the head and she pushes it down her throat. I don't know how long she's been administering drugs like that, but it's not good for her spinal injury or a neck injury is not good for a throat. If not good for the dogs mental well-being and I just am in shock that she doesn't just put the medicine and cheese or food and have her eat it. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	When was a great day for a little bit? I saw my brother and I hung out with cat. And in the morning. We we stayed at a hotel and then the morning we went out actually went out to eat that night. And then we got a lot of things together, but then when I went home to prepare to return to work from vacation, I wasn't sure if my kid was going to get home.  Entire take care of my dog and she's texting me you and blaming me for threatening her and her mom about the dog, which I just said to them and I wasn't going to live in a place where they weren't taking care of the dog properly. Just no reason for me to stay.  So the day was okay and then a friend of mine died of a massive heart attack. That's where I am. He should be here tonight, but he's dead of a massive heart attack.  Acquaintance with a friend I guess.  So today was okay, but my tenant didn't pay her rent on time and then load the rent hasn't arrived at the rent check hasn't arrived. So I have that to deal with.  so there's a lot of stress going on and  yeah, I need to get a haircut shave and  I don't know so many things I need to do and feel overwhelmed. I feel like I can't move and I'm glad that I just get to talk to you about this. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	Okay, Remy today. I went home after every time I just did four days of 16 hours of open. I just did for 4 days in a row working 16 hours. I thought towards the store. Anyway, I was sleeping after work and my dog jumped off the bed down the stairs and yelped. It's about five or six. So something was up earlier and she's very agitated after that and my wife's been very dismissive. I was asking her, you know, are you working tomorrow? I was concerned about who is watching a dog. She's to keep telling me that's not my business. I was he met my wife aren't getting along very well, but the dog was in pain and that's what they need to be done. I don't have a car anymore so I can drive it down to the vet by myself. So we decided to drive it down to the vet and they didn't take X-rays or anything like that, but they did.  True evaluation find out that there's something wrong with her back. So she either sprained her back or she hurt her back if she has herniated disc, who knows but she's in pain so she got a shot and then we're going back and she was still very distressed and panting and moving around and yelping, you know, if you don't hold it, right, so I'm actually I put her in her crate which is like a cage and I left her in Richmond is bad my wife's bad and now I'm back at work out for some more overtime. So yeah, my dog was injured. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	For one friend of mine had a massive heart attack, but I'm not sure if I told you that.  Got a friend of mine had a massive heart attack as a friend at work and then my dog.  was kept  for 3 hours cried because we left her alone.  They wasn't so bad. But the rent money didn't come in for my tenant.  And a half a billion animals have been burned alive.  In Australia, so it's been a sad day. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I am driving to work over so I have bad anxiety all day long when I woke up and then on the way to work, I heard a song and it  yo-yo  that made me sad.  But I mean the day wasn't that bad, but at some point I did have anxiety. I did start to cry it out and I don't know where it was all coming from cuz I had a really good day yesterday. There was an email to talk to you cuz I went to a hotel with Katrina and we hung out and  Pizza and you're in jacuzzi that then the next day. I don't know. Maybe it's at the high was high in the low is low.  I don't know. What spurred the anxiety.  There is some stuff going on at work. I mean I had to have a meeting with HR about an incident again. I told you about the baby of the gentleman Simpson, so I have to follow up with HR this morning. So maybe that was why I was having anxiety. I'm not really sure but  Yeah, I woke up today with some heavy anxiety and and I'm just so you know sometimes I wonder if I'm bipolar. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	So today I was with my dog and now she is injured its neck. So  I came home from work, and I was just trying to comfort her and twice she just cried out in pain and it was really upsetting.  Took her to the vet. And now they say she has a strained neck, but we don't really know what's going on. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	It was the challenge I feel thankful for what challenge do I feel thankful for challenge?  I mean, I guess in some ways I can feel thankful for my ability to get to work even though I don't have a car. So I'm thankful for the challenge of trying to get to work and you can having the Billy to walk to work in the mind how to get myself to work.  I guess that's the challenge I feel most thankful for is my my talents to get to work.  Teaches me to respect my body and my mind and that I'm able to be Mobile in a live-in died of a massive heart attack. So the challenge of getting to work. I'm thankful for. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	My kid just left for Christmas vacation and the wife and I have to both work but someone needs to stay home with the dog! I have missed several days of over time because of lack of communication! We need the money as our rent is expensive and my wife doesn’t make enough to help out and refuses to pay rent and other bills since she found out I was having an affair 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I guess when I became shop steward and I'm trying to be this union rep trying to learn more about being in the Union's. I probably don't push myself out of my comfort zone enough.  When I'm taking care of my condominium, I actually have to make a phone call to PNC Bank. See if my car I received the insurance. I can't put myself out of that zone or that comfort zone. So out of my comfort zone just becoming shop through I guess was out of my comfort zone. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I'm longing for Financial Security.  to feel financially secure  add at the same time do something that's creative do a job that I love and other don't love this job. I'm very grateful for my job. But I would like to have Financial Security in some way. Whatever that means. I'd like to be wealthy. I like to not have to worry about money be able to travel so I long for financial wealth  Over security. I guess she's a financial wealth. 
nG9x6wkN8yaYTodtibaSdCUUwwn2	I talked to you wrote some letters and just now took some big breaths

nHJ8KL6l9rcrbS82MB0KtOsHRoz2	Finishing college and starting a job at an hotel

nmL1QyuAJQMo65kc8HQNBTSFEq02	What does my mom mean to me when she talks about life?  I guess.  It just feels good to know that someone cares and that I can trust someone with everything and know that she has the best advice that I could ever ask for. And I think that's the best thing about talking about life with her. 
nmL1QyuAJQMo65kc8HQNBTSFEq02	I would have really say interesting. I would just say I've been thinking a lot about how I'm redshirting and how I am changing my degree to education and I'm not really sure and what I want to do with it, and I've been thinking there's a lot in general.  about how I met rating this year and what it's going to be like  And I don't know I guess I'm kind of nervous a little bit about it. 
nmL1QyuAJQMo65kc8HQNBTSFEq02	I went to my appointment. So I got that done with I've been dreading to go to that.  I would say I'm not reaching my goals yet just because I'm not in school but  I'm reaching my goals as in becoming a better person. I feel like and more family-oriented. I needed to be like more like soft and able to say no to things and Noah.  Is more important? 
nmL1QyuAJQMo65kc8HQNBTSFEq02	I went.  To an appointment this morning and then I came home and I just relaxed and did a puzzle and I spent time with my mom. I went shopping a little I got a coffee this morning. I ate dinner with my family and talk to Michael my boyfriend for a little bit and  Hampstead to relax 
nmL1QyuAJQMo65kc8HQNBTSFEq02	I'm grateful that I'm starting to feel better cuz I was really sick and I'm grateful that I have people in my life that I really care about and I love and they love me.  There's a lot of things to be grateful for but I think the big one is just family and knowing that I have them every day that I need and without needing just having them in my life. 
nmL1QyuAJQMo65kc8HQNBTSFEq02	I think everyone has a family but it's hard to know.  it's hard to say someone's family is family because some families are different than when I think of family I think of my family and how close we are and how much we love each other and I don't think every family is like that and I think  I guess that's the way I look at a family of being.

oChFkfJsQXO77bIqAWplrt0yuSd2	I suppose we shouldn't assume anything about her new friends.  That's like most people I think we judge books by their covers and what a person is wearing their hair how they take care of themselves as what 
oChFkfJsQXO77bIqAWplrt0yuSd2	Probably go visit an artist friend who lives there. 
oChFkfJsQXO77bIqAWplrt0yuSd2	I could rent a car to go to Point Reyes, but I'm more of an event space Travelers. So I must have a reason to go to Point Reyes. I probably wouldn't just rent a car to do that. 
oChFkfJsQXO77bIqAWplrt0yuSd2	How do I assume a lot about our new friends? That is a very weird question? 
oChFkfJsQXO77bIqAWplrt0yuSd2	Find question. I'm  Pretty reserved I think so. I don't think I would open up a lot about myself to a new friend, but  It's funny. I think we will probably assume a lot about me depending on the context of where we are. So find out with my girlfriend and we're at a place, you know, we done to dress better than than the most people around me take some effort in our appearance. So I think it would things in people's mind good or bad. But I like to think that a reaction is generally positive. 
oChFkfJsQXO77bIqAWplrt0yuSd2	I guess that would be working on a project that that I really believe in. I I felt like the last few years and Ashley. I really believe in the product.  but the product evolved into the  the  there wasn't a good Visionary to push a single Direction. I think if you asked 10 different people in the development team what the product was that you would get 10 different answers and we had to be a product and I think he was very inclusive in his team management style. But is also very avoidant. He  he acknowledged that the buck stops with him, but he  he was hesitant to make decisions and he was he was like, he should have been driving product the product vision and he was looking for that guidance from other people, which I think it was indicative of  now perhaps he wasn't right for the role. 
oChFkfJsQXO77bIqAWplrt0yuSd2	Well, I've been working on my portfolio and I think I've made some some pretty good progress. It's a bit of an iterative process and I always looking for different ways to optimize it and then looking at Google analytics to see how people are responding to it.  people some people seem to be responding really well and some people don't  and I guess that's good information out because I from there I can get in hopefully figure out what's what people are liking in. My people are liking somebody spending less than 10 seconds that probably  There's a reaction to that so there.  Started just pushing it aside and I really want to figure out why cuz I think the designs are good. I mean that I'm just  maybe just not what people are looking for any case that's what must have been doing with my day in and now I'm going to get ready to go to the Edwardian Ball. 
oChFkfJsQXO77bIqAWplrt0yuSd2	What would I do with the limousine in a driver for a day? Well, that means I can only go so far as it takes to get somewhere half a day.  I probably go up north probably go somewhere like Mara Woods or Point Reyes or something like that. Just sort of to get away. I guess I'd have  I wouldn't have to worry about driving. So I guess alone with my thoughts in the back of the car. They probably have a computer with me and it's all things are probably has a plug so I wouldn't have to worry about battery running out.  limousines  I don't know doesn't doesn't seem like the kind of thing. I would actually just want to do get a limousine in and drive. I mean maybe I would go to Napa because then I can I can drink can I have a driver and I wouldn't have to worry about you know staying sober for the right home next that probably sounds like the best thing to do. 
oChFkfJsQXO77bIqAWplrt0yuSd2	Because I don't have a car and I got to rent a car to go to Point Reyes.

oFUBrc3wbIWKQdgQejkqLmrJHSc2	I’m really thankful to wake up 
oFUBrc3wbIWKQdgQejkqLmrJHSc2	I feel like a failure, that I’m not worth anything. I will never be loved, find love. I will never form any genuine friendships that will last. I’m unhappy, broken. I’m tired of feeling alone. I’m being left back. I don’t have any goals that I met  on my own. I don’t have a relationship with God like I wanted to and need to have. I don’t want to love anymore. I’m stuck!!

oFUBrc3wbIWKQdgQejkqLmrJHSc2	I went out in service, meeting, but for some reason I’m not happy after. 
oGTiLrfIZieNwGD3Q67rSR5xJfk2	"It’s just become so frustrating to hang out with friends when the whole group is there, and I don’t think I’ve been hiding it particularly well either. 

The teasing has died down a bit recently - Alex will sometimes still tease but at least he doesn’t do it when she’s there. I still feel really awkward about those two snaps that Caroline saw on the bus that one day though - it’s hard to convince myself that she doesn’t know I like her after something like that. 

And then there’s Huy. This one is a tough one for me, and I think most of my frustration towards him is just an emotional reaction to him and Caroline getting all close and touchy. I think this is probably the worst part about hanging out as a group, and I’ve tried to ignore it but I’m finding it really hard. There’s a lot more that I’m feeling here, but I would be upset with myself for writing them down and admitting them. 

At least there’s the Strokes concert to look forward to though. I was not expecting that invitation, and right now I’m still pretty sure there’s nothing more to read into about that, but at least I’ll get to see the Strokes live! I need to start focusing on the positives of each day, so I’ll try end all of these with a positive note. "

ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I went today at like 2 to about 5. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	Yeah, I'd like going shopping by myself. I think it's quite relaxing actually, sometimes I prefer that over going with people. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	A lot. I mean, he really taught me and let me hear really influenced heavily influenced my mindset I think and the way I think on a daily basis. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I guess if you're referring to my friend group back then then I guess then that lunch game. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	10 of  the fear of the unknown for the future and the romanticisation of every situation that I'm in.  Well, I guess ironically my money issues if I could just pay $100 and get a lot of freaking money back or its my student loan covered that be great.  I would pay $100 if I can just lose weight have better food.  options  the ability to focus if I'm reading a book or whatever staying in the present rather than finding myself wander into the past and the present or the past in the future.  The lack of confidence whatever lack of confidence regarding my music and just you know, Talent my talent in general.  my loneliness I would definitely pay $1000000 to do that and  the motivation to journal and find a coping mechanism.  Regarding my emotional intelligence. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I realized that one year ago today even the time I had broken up with a boy that I felt really really really strongly for. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I think meditating on a mantra that I feel like would help me kind of remind myself, you know that I've been using a lot as I love and accept myself. It's simplistic and vague, but I think it's because it's so big is applicable to a lot of situations. So I use that one a lot. I think, you know spending my time and regulating my time to towards things that will help me grow as a human being other than sitting and binge watching Gossip Girl, which I've been really really good on but good dividing my time into stuff that will help me like watching YouTube videos or stoicism reading meditating eating healthy working out. and yeah, and also I think that you know, maybe I should take the time and  Kind of, you know, I found a lot of therapeutic. I felt a lot of therapy I guess yesterday, but I might do that again today and which will help me boost my self-confidence about my physical appearance and it will also be there just therapeutic because it's just nice and fun to do. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I think that I keep having dreams of this guy because one I am very obsessed with the infatuation. I have Associated to him and I  I think he just represents a lot of things that I'm looking for a he looks like my ex and you know, sometimes I subconsciously didn't but he's probably a better version of my ex, but maybe that's because I'm still not over my ex. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I don't believe so know. I definitely believe that I'm in tune with them. But I don't think that I am where I want to be which is actually a good place to be because it's like, you know if I were in a good place.  You know why? I'm always wanting to grow I  I don't know. I'm not necessarily coping with them. Well, I am very in tune. I know why the way they are. I know exactly why I'm feeling the way that I am but it's motivating myself to Nino eradicate those emotions. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I would like my friends to adhere to my feelings and you know, just kind of sitting and listening with me and having conversations in and sometimes I mean, I'd like them to interject with their  experiences and he know how I would expect that my friends.  I don't know are not terrible people that they are nice to those who well are like people who are like them and people who are not like them so 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	say  my dad  for his Christmas present my mom for her Christmas present.  Gabby for her birthday present  the app for taking pictures of him  and  Katie for spending New Year's with her 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I definitely think that it is, you know, I came from a place where everyone was very open about everything and I felt like it influenced a lot of drama in my high school friend group and it didn't really challenge me intellectually as much as I did kind of sit around and talk about  talk about things and like what not and feeling it didn't necessarily I didn't learn anything new if that makes sense. I just kind of had an outlet and I think coming here. I didn't really feel that outlet feeling that I did with everybody else back home. And so I got really scared and I kind of rejected those emotions onto my friend group and I kind of got worried and I do very very much enjoy them and I love them dearly. I am very happy for them. And I'm very happy that I've kind of made my way out of the theater friend Posse. I think that  You know, I learned a lot just by sitting with them and just being in the present having fun not feeling any obligations to you know, make things better if that makes sense like and kind of reinforce that drama aspect. I just have fun with them and that's about it. And I do as you can sit down and have a conversation like that with other people and sometimes it's with them. So I'm very happy in that way and you can also it internally like sitting with my friend groups. It kind of gave me new emotions that I've never really dealt with and so through that I have learned internally to regulate and find a better way to balance those emotions. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I think a lot of my New Year's resolutions are derived from the internal experience or than the external. I think that my New Year's resolutions are more. I think that one I need to focus more on myself. I need to you know become emotionally available in order for me to experience a stable relationship. So that goal not necessarily has to get into a relationship but to become emotionally unavailable not even just for a relationship, but for everyone around me because I want to be able to give them my friends and whoever a pint of my undivided attention I rather than me so focused and caught up in my unregulated emotions, and I guess two would be more just to you know, find a good coping mechanism. Which I guess this is just a delivery. That's the word from my first one is to find a good healthy coping mechanism like starting to journal against trying to write poetry Again lyrics songs playing guitar singing my ass off. You know, I think that thing with Urinetown will help that a lot and I think that yeah, it's really just Yeah, that's it. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	Yes in the way of ice hot with it for a hot second and I just experience the emotions. I was feeling and I let myself, tear up and you know, I think after that I I kind of was fine. So 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I am preparing to go to bed.  Because I have work in the morning. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I  one I think very abstract. I understand a lot of things that aren't necessarily analytical I've even though sometimes it's really hard to know when I ever think it's hard to picture it.  At 2 I am pretty witty. I personally believe I think that I am very Not Innocent really super funny. But I think that I can bring a lot of weight to conversations 3, I am intrigued by, you know other people and I think you know having those interests will help me further my success in the future.  for I care deeply about people that I that I obviously love and even people that I'm not so you know that I don't know very well and v i  have the ability to  You know take care of other people and to watch other people into you know, I give them my attention when they needed and wanted. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	Anxiety a lot of the time I wake up a couple times before my alarm goes off thinking I'm late and I have dreams, you know, that kind of I wake up and I'm in flight-or-fight mode and I think just getting to bed is a Tuffy. I mean considering it's 3 in the in the morning and I haven't gone to bed yet. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I'm thankful for the ability to wear bracelets because my wrists aren't super tiny. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I've been super thankful for my new friend Katie who is dating my friend Spencer, and I'm really thankful for her because I got to sit down and talk with her and we accidently talk for like 5 hours. Just getting to know each other and getting in Sharing experiences and sharing emotions and you know being you know it vulnerable with each other which is something I've been craving a lot from a friend. So I'm really happy with that. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I'm really thankful for my dad because he has taught me so many things about life at about emotional intelligence and about, you know spirituality. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I  I'm feeling grateful, I guess since I only have a couple days of 2020 so far. I'm feeling really grateful for Katie for being an awesome friend Macy for making me feel comfortable.  I'm thankful for the ability to be able to walk to Mass Street when I want to you know, enjoy kind of just a quiet afternoon with a lot of things to do and I'm thankful for  Work cuz I'm making money. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I'm thankful for being able to conveniently play music off of my TV because it has a nice system and I don't have to you know blast my phone every single time. I want to listen or listen music. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I'm really thankful for.  Do you know going back in time maybe like?  2 years ago when I did All Shook Up the musical with a friend group of mine. And now I have never been so tight with a friend group and there's just one rehearsal day. That was a 8-hour rehearsal day and we all just hung out for 8 hours and worked on Musical that we all very much appreciated and loved and we made a lot of fun videos and we just had a really really freaking fun time that night that day. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I'm excited to see my progress. I'm excited to see where I go from the beginning of the year to the end of the year and see you know, what how exactly I've grown and what ways is what ways have I even changed and I'm just very excited to see that progress. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I think  going shopping going thrifting and you know just kind of  being in the present and looking for what I wanted for my cross to draw. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I think people you know, it really just depends on the person because again, they are perception. Their projection is our perception. So the people are going to be and also I'm very infatuated with the and intrigued by The Duality of Man like how people can change depending on the circumstances that they're in so I definitely alter my personality and it was all me it's all one personality, but I definitely like show parts of myself that will that will come inside with and compliment the environment that I'm in so I guess it really just depends but I think overall in and on an average I think people will perceive me as an eccentric chaotic but weird in a good way  Caring I hope trustworthy I hope.  And you know, I think the imagery that comes to mind is sunny. So I really hope people can not help but I think that's how people perceive me is not necessarily the most negative person but a very optimistic person. I think that's what people see me is. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I think with the lack of differentiation we all would be very very, you know, kind of  distance from our egoic side. I think that if we all had the same physical appearance, I think that there would be more of a I think differentiation would lie moron like talent and  Talent and intellect and skills rather than obviously the looks. I think that without physical appearance. We would have less of a draw towards capitalism.  I think that we would obviously I don't think that you know gender roles wouldn't be inculcated. So I think with that which comes from the Christianity, I think that Christian religion would also be very on  different  but also race and there's a lot of things to be, you know contemplating here when regarding everyone having the same physical appearance. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	The anxiety I was feeling around him. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I was able to email a therapist back which was nice and I made some money at work. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I think I think you know by the end of this year, I guess if we're talking about timeline throughout the year.  I should be able to should be but I have a better idea on you no regulation and a better idea of who I am maybe and you know, re-evaluating my friendships and establishing, you know these  People are here for me no matter what kind of free evaluating things in my life and determining whether they're healthy or not in accordance to my emotional stability. And you know, I think by summertime at the end of summer time, I am beginning of school year next year. I should be able to be more confident in myself, you know in regards to schooling and regards to know everything and have a better idea on how to establish a leadership role and to you know be confident with myself and being you know,  Be okay with being myself, I guess and obviously by the end of the year is my goal. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I would say my creativity. I wouldn't necessarily put that in drug correlation to my talents but more of coming up with you know, abstract ideas and thinking outside of the box a little bit. I definitely pride myself with that. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	all right, so I'm feeling kind of  a little out of whack right now thinking about you know that romanticisation of that one person is kind of  Is a continuity within my my mind today?  I can't really help but to  kind of hold on to these ideas.  And I don't know why I do that. I don't know if I even need to find why I do it.  Maybe more like a because I mean more to that I keep like digging.  I keep wanting to dig but I feel like I've already done enough and what I need to do is shift my focus. I'm not on to something, you know, like pointing fingers and saying this is what the reason is that more focused on K. How can I fix it now and  I think that my fixation on this one particular person not as soon as the person themselves with romanticized stations of said person is  A projection of not necessarily maybe my loneliness but when I think about that, I think of it as an end of an era. So I'm not necessarily happy where I'm at right now. I still feel a lot of guilt from the situations in the past. I think what's really got me frustrated is the idea that I can't fix things. I can't fix everything, you know, and I feel like I'm very unfeeling as a friend.  And then I do stupid things and I get very caught up in these stupid things like yesterday with Katie, you know, it was really really fun. But I feel like sometimes I said something really weird National done that  andam  hello.  I don't know really where to go with this because I have a lot of I don't have a lot of structure because it's like okay, what's Step 1 of resolving my issues, but you know, I don't really  have you in a  Guide sheet her anything. Just let me know what I need to be doing other than he know my own self, which is kind of hard because I'm so used to having external validation external guidance rather than following my intuition and following myself, which I know that's probably the first step of listening to myself and saying, okay, what do you want and not really overthinking things?  And it's frustrating cuz yeah to an extent. I do know that that's why I'm saying these things but it's like  How do I put that into play? How do I practice what I what I preach and  yeah, I need to focus on eating healthy or more. I think I need to.  I really just got to take care of myself before I can get into any relationship with anybody and that regard that we're getting physical and mental.  And meanwhile like I'm not very attracted to Jeffrey.  I still feel attached to me. Nice to look at the songs he posts.  The lyrics are but you know.  I don't know. I just  I don't know if  my infatuation with this one particular person is a derivative off of my Pino unresolved feelings from me and Jeffries relationship or if it's something entirely different and it's driving from like I said loneliness and not and unsatisfaction with myself.  I think you could be a little bit of both not necessarily from the relationship in particular, but more of  you're not really the relationship that particular but you know the effects of I think that's why I don't really feel very attached to Jeffrey but  I think it's the stuff that I had acquired through the relationship, but I'm still dealing with such as codependency and  You know.  And took on satisfaction with myself. And you know, I'm scared that I'm not being a fulfilling person and then I'm not you know a good person. I know that's very, you know, and I'm very conflicted because it's like I do understand that morals don't necessarily exist there only a society there only a societal constructs, but I also understand that because we live in a society, you know, those morals are a thing.  And I don't want to be a bad person. I am a very social being and I rely on a lot on human interaction and I'm just scared that I'm not and I feel guilty that I don't feel fulfilled from some of my friends. I don't know how to fix that.  Cuz I'm like, I really enjoy being around my friends sometimes and then sometimes I'm like, I don't feel fulfilled by this.  Because I'm not really getting the stimulation a lot of intellectual stimulation from them.  And that's why I like I was happy to hang out with Katie cuz we talked a lot. But I also am very nervous with our friendship because I'm just scared. I'm going to take her off.  But I know that's coming out her it's or me either necessarily. It's just my it's no one's fault. But it is me that make sense.  I feel like I'm on a tightrope and if I do one wrong move, which I feel like I've done a couple already, but I'm still on the tightrope for some reason, you know what I'm saying? Like I'm making mistakes.  But I feel like she's going to like not trust me. You're not want to be around me.  But I know maybe I should just talk to her about it.  I just don't know how I bring that up because it's like I want to talk to her about you know.  How awkward I feel I think honestly what we just needed another philosophical conversation about it just about things in general, you know, and I also am trying to get a therapist. Like I know that that would help me a lot because what I really want for this to happen, and I don't need to go and I know I'm doing this I'm going in with expectations.  you know, I'm allowed to have wishes and I'm allowed to want something that I can't have a set expectation and  Assume it's going to come true because I know that I will be let down and that's why I'm really nervous about this mystery man. You know, I'm saying like  it takes two to tango. I remember that and yes.  Even though I like him and I will do my best to not screw it up. I understand. The universe is bigger than me. And if it doesn't if we're not meant to be together than we're not.  And that's why I'm trying really hard not to get attached to this person to this idea of the person cuz I don't really even know him.  And that's why I'm trying to take a step back and I feel like I'm overthinking things which I have a tendency to do and make things awkward. And you know, I have this idea of like if the person is watching me right now than they would think I'm really really weird and you know, I always go to that idea because it's like obviously I'm going to focus on the negative cuz that's just what I've been taught to do. But you know, I I don't know if I like I don't have any external.  I even validation is the word because it's late and I understand I probably need a little bit because right now I'm starting to lose a little bit of reality right now because I'm like what's happening at? You know, I'm back in highschool. I used to get a lot of validation and  you know, they were very outward about things like that. But I feel like they're not as at work here and it's hard for me to  grasp because then it is it's not hard but it's not easy. You know, I actually have to you know.  Work if that makes sense in like kind of read situations.  Or as last year in like the years before that they were very out where they're like, oh Lionel you're you're you're like me and they would give me compliments and that's what I don't get here. And I don't know if that's just because they don't give the compliments or that's just because I'm not doing good enough.  but I know that that's kind of a  statement I shouldn't I should rethink because it's like  Yeah, you know I can't rely on these comments and his compliments.  and also like  that's not how a lot of people you know, I think it's more of them than it is me, you know, nothing personal. I guess I'm just scared that I don't have enough differentiation from everybody. Friendships is the lack of differentiation the lack of intellectual stimulation, even though I feel like I do get some of that.  The lack of excitement and I hate to say that I just feel like I don't get excitement. But I think that's also because my friend group last year. I had a lot of drama and honestly drama that just like romances and it's like that was something that was really interesting and that everyone talked about and I guess I'm just so used to gossiping and on the bad way just  That's the way I used to talk. And so I don't get that here. And so it's just like all we do is sit in a circle and not really do anything but even then like  I still felt excitement from the friend group. Even if even if it wasn't like, you know.  Relax and whatnot. It was still fun.  And I don't know what I'm doing wrong and it's not fun here. I just I guess I'm only really thinking about situation the bad situations that I felt bad and because I felt the lack of control and I acted out in ways. I shouldn't and now I'm thinking of the situations in which I feel like I pissed everybody off.  You know, I feel really bad for showing Riley tourettes videos. Like I like the dress Guy videos. I feel bad about saying things. I maybe shouldn't have you know, I phrase things sometimes and I'm like, oh I shouldn't have said that and I I shouldn't have you know,  Raise it like that.  I just I'm very open about my emotions and I want to talk I despise small talk.  I think the only two things that I really enjoy genuinely talking about is like humorous conversations and like  not like emotional talks not even emotional just philosophical and maybe even including a little bit of emotion, but  When I can get into that, but you know, I think I mix up emotions and thoughts because it's like when I I kind of correlate the two and I said philosophical and emotional because I'm a very emotional I think with my emotions. I think I correlate the two of them I sent  And I don't know I just I am.  kerfuffled if you will with the  duality in the contradictions in the Jets positions in antithesis of the human being because it's like yeah, you can think one thing and then completely do the next thing and it feel it feel Justified, but you can articulate the justification.  And I guess I'm a person that has to have everything figured out for me to feel comfortable.  That's why I focus on myself a lot 1st and not in. This is one of the best ways because it's like I wallow and I feel things out until I feel like I'm done but that's not a very healthy chicken isn't because I just sit with it and I kind of have it and not necessarily become ization, but I have a fear of victimisation that I kind of people please a little bit cuz I want people to think that I'm a helper which I guess is victimization in and itself, but it's a little hidden so it's not like that on the surface.  And I want you to think that I help people and then I you know, I'm helper. I'm at Walla where I don't sit and I'm not selfish. I don't want to be seen as selfish.  And that's why I rethink a lot of situations in which I felt like other people thought that I was selfish.  and that's why I feel like sometimes I don't deserve my friends is because  I don't I really think I'm like, oh I did this terrible thing. And why would they want to be friends with me and I feel so much guilt and I am so hard on myself.  And I know what I could do, but yet I choose to sit on my phone and not really do anything.  I guess sometimes I look at it and I'm like what is all the hard work work for like, why would I try to do that if it's not going to pay out and I always want to try that. I was want to try and find the cheap way out of things to like be able to do things but in the least amount of work possible like and then also like  That's a mentality in regards to you. No romantic relationships. How far can I go and when like Tinder and Bumble in like all of these things to where I'm still  You know. ears  so  now that I don't have that and I haven't had that I feel very  unfulfilled sometimes but sometimes I I feel like a little bit more empowered.  I don't know. It's just because I feel a lot different and I know there's no emotions in people fluctuate and  I just  going back to my dilemma the tip of the iceberg if you will.  I know what I need to do.  I know that I can't go in with expectations. I know that I weather wherever it arriving to write whatever it be derived of.  It's about my insecurities.  And or something.  I need to resolve because it's stressful. It makes me nervous. It's not and I and I I get so fixated on it. I don't just think about it once in awhile and then let it go I think about all the time and I know that's an obsession and obsessions are not cut.  so  what I need to focus on is not the external I can't go in with expectations. I can't focus on what if I do this one thing and this person's going to do that snow.  I need to focus on myself and I have to trust myself that if I take care of myself and I believe in myself and grow the confidence.  for myself  Then what needs to happen will come to me good things will come to me if I put the good out in the world not even in the world but into myself.  Because everyone feels it I mean, what's that? Is that the  First inside of the second Insight from that book. I think it's the second but  or even the third item number, but  Vibrational frequency. Why's everyone feels  Whatever one is it that makes sense Butterfly Effect. If I am I if I'm a genuinely nice person and I radiate Good Vibration then, you know, everyone will feel that.  and if not, that's because they're so fixated on their negative emotions and they're going to perceive mine and the regards of theirs because  You know.  You're going to see with whatever tinted lens you're wearing.  so  what I need to focus on is not maybe looking up with codependent this in this in this but more of how can I take care of myself?  And that's not necessarily something. I can look up on Google. It's something I have to ask myself.  It's something I have to look at myself and I said, okay. What can I do that's better and I know if I know I know the answers.  And I'm going to tell you right now I'm going to say things that I can do to take care of myself right now and in the near future eat better and me it's going to be simplistic stuff. And it's also going to be like things like meditate and things like journal and things like actually find a good coping mechanism.  That makes me happy that excites me where it finds out excitement that I crave so much of not necessarily from other people because that is codependent.  But find that excitement through something else whether it be something or yourself.  Whatever. It is find a good healthy coping mechanism that makes you happy.  and build confidence  I think with that comes reframing  my perception may be thinking something that's negative and taking that in like okay how  Can I take that and switch it into something positive when this thing is?  At what point? Where is the boundary between letting myself crying and think about it and be sad versus and suppression versus reframing I think maybe it's because like He really is just like learning to drive stick and doing the the cleft or whatever. It is clutch the clutch and the accelerator when you're starting to the car. You just got to find a good sweet spot.  interesting analogy  But what I really need to do, I'm going to give myself three things cuz I don't want to overwhelm myself.  build confidence  do The Superficial things that make you think that you think that would help you?  Which eating healthy sleeping reading instead of watching Netflix?  And finding a good healthy coping ISM finding finding a good healthy. Coconut coconut. Oh my goodness coping mechanism that  Gives me that excitement that I felt from other people maybe not the exact excitement and the same feeling but something that I can feel encouraged by through myself not by other people.  Yeah.  That was a lot. I don't know how long that was. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I really love my jean jacket because it's heavy and it keeps me warm and it has these three pins that I bought from a really cute store downtown that says that has cats on it and bicycle and then another one has lfk. And then another one is local Roasters, which is a coffee store at in my hometown. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I started feeling really fearful. You know, I'm also in a building that not a lot of people are in right now. And so I hear creeks and croaks and that really kind of influence to my fear-driven feelings.  But yeah, I think because I was just feeling really scared and lonely. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I would go to a very very nice school for the things. I'm studying. I would travel the freaking world. No 1 learning to communicate Knowledge from all different kinds of places. I would you know get my friends things to let them know I care about them so much. I would not be on campus. I would be, you know living somewhere else with people that I care about I would  Terror I would buy healthy foods regarding produce I would  You know by from Brands I would be more, you know conscious about, you know, different kinds of Brands and we'll do they animal test if they have sweatshops and all of that kind of stuff. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I  I ate and I actually you know, I didn't necessarily watch what I was eating, but I did eat food today and I  I did my makeup and I felt pretty. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	Yes, I think a lot of my high school mistakes, including Gavin and you know Ari and you know Becca end here and I really would like to let go of that because you know, I still carry a lot of guilt from that. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	No, no, I think to an extent.  I definitely push myself negatively and I'm hard on myself, but I don't push myself. I think I don't motivate myself to do other thing. I mean something bad happens and I just wallow about it and I get really anxious and I don't really know how to do with the anxiousness and neither. Do I want to eat some part of myself because I feel like I deserve that anxiety. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	Yes.  And no only yes because late obviously, of course I am and to know because I'm scared that I don't know what's going to happen because humans don't do well with ambiguity. I mean, that's just how it is.  Not naturally but societal. Yes.  So I don't know what's going to happen. And that's what makes me very nervous and not excited for the future. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I care a lot. I think that it is really really important that I that I appealed to others because you know, I I am very very dependent on other people and I think that I want to you know, in order for me to help people people have to trust me and they have to you know understand that I'm here to help. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I think no I don't think I do. I think I could do a lot better, but I could also do a lot worse, but I definitely think that I should take better care of myself.  In regards to you, no physicality. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I would say the amount of knowledge that I have at my fingertips that I really haven't really indulged in a tall obviously like there's plenty of books on my desk that I could read. That would help me better myself. There's plenty of YouTube videos that I've saved in my watchlist so I can watch them but I never really good to them because I'm scared of being vulnerable and being overwhelmed.  I don't I don't know why I do that. I think it's because I'm just so overwhelmed with emotion that I I was scared that I'm going to feel too much, you know, so yeah. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I think I should continue to meditate I should continue to read and I should just you know in general focus on things. That would help me become a better person rather than managing my time at a poorly management. I'm poorly and investing time in my phone, which doesn't really do much depending on the things. I'm investing myself in so social media and just stuff that you know things that I've doesn't really perpetuate those healthy Tendencies and healthy thinking pattern. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	You know that's kind of hard to focus on cuz you know, the brain wants to see what it sees. And so I would say I think Katie invited me to a movie with her friend. Emily was really really nice. So I am very thankful for that. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	It was a pretty easy. I definitely pride myself on the ability to understand my emotions and where they come from other two Notions where the B. You know, I feel like I can really understand myself and find the root of everything. I vent Within Myself And so like it's really easy for me to reflect on myself.  in that way 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I would say the only thing I couldn't live without is.  music I really am going to say music superficial answer but  I think  it  as cliche as it sounds I think that it evokes a lot more emotion than a lot of things and whether I'm making it or listening to it, it helps me cope a lot makes me think and makes me reflect and makes me feel things in ways that other things couldn't 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I am longing to experience.  Other cultures and seeing how other people that aren't like me, you know live everyday. I'm really compelled to see it because I think that getting a glimpse into other people's two types of cultures will help us further understand, you know the world  I'm global scale and you know, maybe be able to further empathize with those that aren't like us. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I've always wanted to feel like I positively affected the planet in regards to helping people and using my passions to do so. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I would say a good person would.  I want to focus more on the internal revenue external because morality and good the term good is very relative. But for good to me, it would be very focused on that someone who's very in-tune with themselves whether it be emotions what emotions and you know thinking and you know, they're not going to  Indulging people-pleasing Tendencies. They're not going to work very little because people fluctuate what not to happens. Everyone gets caught up in their ego except I would say that they're very aligns the source and they don't necessarily do things.  Out of obligation for them to increase or alter their identity.  other people 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I think that you know, I want to be that person for my friends and for myself because you know thinking about being a stable human being is very in a motivating. I want to be able to you know experience life to the fullest rather than be so caught up in the future in the past. I want to become more aware and I want to accumulate my vibrational frequency in order for me to experience life in a better way. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	Well, I can't really grasp what accurate is because again, like I don't really I can't really perceive myself in the view of others. But you know, I think that's a pretty fair argument that I made could be looked into.  Cuz I don't really know I really really truly don't. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I don't know something good. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I think that I would act in accordance to what I want rather than what I want to do for other people.  And what I need rather than what I want, I guess I feel like if I didn't have much fear, I wouldn't people please I wouldn't do things out of obligation for other people.  I would feel okay with ambiguity that most definitely and I would just live my life the way I want you by being in the present. I would be very focused in the present mean while you know, still attending to you know, my Reflections in the past and my you know, I'm not going to make super stupid impulsive decisions because I am aware of you know, my actions do impact the future so  simultaneously living in the present while being aware of past and future 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	They would probably be in Germany because I'm learning a language and it would be around a culture that I'm very fascinated by. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	Well, I mean, I don't think there's anything I can do about that. I meant you no, I'm not in any control whatsoever. But she know honestly metaphorically I think that we are because like  Yes or no, but since we're all interconnected, the people that are controlling us is the source which we are apart of but also if we associate ourselves with our ego then I guess we're not in control and we're not aligned for the source. So the simulation simulation is you know the source.  In control of you know people who are aligned with their ego rather than the source or just goes in general. So yeah, I know and I think I could be said to a lot of things because it's like when you are lying to a source you were in control to an extent and you can you know manifest things and you know, what can I come regarding your energy and where you put it towards but if you are aligned with your email, you're going to feel a lack of control with a lot of things because you knew hey, you can't really no regular can't regulate and he can't manifest correctly. I guess you can but negative thing. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I think by instead of sitting on my phone for two hours. I'm going to take at least one of those hours or something some of that time or all of that time to you know, if I not coping mechanism and to sit down and do that and also just kind of sit with my feelings and you know, see where they're at. You know, I think also mindfulness meditation will really help I want to get back into that because that was very helpful and very enlightening. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I think going to IHOP with Katie and Spencer just because of how relaxing it was to just be around friends that I'm comfortable with. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I think being around Teddy and Spencer. We parked a couple jokes. I couldn't tell you exactly what but being with friends in general and cracking jokes was always really nice. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I believe I was in Lawrence where I live with a boy that I've very much been infatuated with and had a crush on. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	My day's been pretty chill. I honestly not really done that much and when I went to work and I went thrifting for about 2 hours and then I came back and just come a chilled out and hang out until I have to get ready for this party. I'm going to 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I definitely think I don't really eat very healthy. I don't have the  great sleep schedule. I think especially physically it's really hard for me to feel beautiful in that physical appearance way.  But I don't really know how to do that other than work out which is really hard to motivate myself. And I think that's probably another thing is I can't really motivate myself to work out very often but everything else looks like I'm doing I'm doing everything else. But otherwise, I feel like I'm doing a lot better. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	Probably my dad because he understands a lot of you know as the way I think and he'll also is a therapist so he can guide me in the right and help me direction. So yeah, I know that he can I'm really close with him and you know, he loves me unconditionally, so he's going to stay here for a while. So he'll keep an eye on me and tell me when I'm you know,  pursuing my goal in the healthy way or not. So healthy way so which is ironic cuz she pursuing them healthy way it was counterproductive. But yeah. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	What what? Okay, that was very descriptive. If you want to feel like you didn't affect the planet in the least attracted to you. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I normally just talked to her over the phone like phone call, but sometimes we text. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I would probably stick with anthropology cuz I'm super passionate about it. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	No, Katie was at the movie. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I don't know how to not describe it. I don't care. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	Spencer's boyfriend. He's cool. Yeah. I mean I'm happy with him cuz he's cool. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I think would be severely overpopulated. I think that we wouldn't have the diverse population as we have now. I don't think that we would have you know.  And if you think the Earth would be more densely populated in certain areas rather than spread out amongst the entirety of the world. I think that  Yeah. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	Nothing can stop me from achieving a success I desire. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	one of my favorite streets is  tiramisu from Alvaro 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	Wow, I think I know I got up early enough to drink coffee, which is something I am, you know what pressure that I could do and I'm pretty thankful that I you know, I I got up and went to work on time got there on time and that I went out and did things instead of being cooped up in the house all day. So I think going out and  spending time with friends really helped me a lot with this, you know, very drastic change of this last week. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I think that you know, nothing super specific but just the unknown in general is kind of making me nervous only because you know, I don't know exactly what's going to happen. You know, I'm majoring in anthropology. But you know at this point, I'm not necessarily sure what I'm doing with it specifically yet. I know what I want to do, but you know it it's about app like no applicator went to the world and you know be finding a conventional way to do things that I'm passionate about. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I think that negative influence thoughts is something that I can use lots of I think that you know, a lot of the decisions that I've made that I make and the lot of thoughts that I have are always influenced by something negative which obviously intern manifests a lot of negative things and you know, if I can eradicate that then I believe that I would have a much happier life. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I think splurging money on you know, I'm not an everyday thing. I would say Obviously food or do you know something that really makes me happy? I don't think that you know spending money on something that you want versus, you know, it is going to feel really good. But sometimes it's like when you see something in the store, you're like and you know, there's something inside you tell me you should buy it and when you buy it, you don't feel guilty as Sin on a you know bigger scale. It's like obviously education is something that I think is very important to spend money on. and yeah, yeah things regarding he no knowledge and  and I'm just experiencing I guess. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I learned that sometimes it is difficult. Sometimes you just have to deal with the uncomfortable and sometimes you can't really necessarily chocolate to where you are comfortable because I want to know if you keep talking the uncomfortable thing. You're always going to be uncomfortable like think of a metaphorical itch every single time. You have an itch and you scratch it you're going to have another we are constantly going to have hitches. But you know, if you are sit if you sit and you know are comfortable with the itch then that is the true wisdom and if you will 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I think my friend may see because she we were hanging out today as when I went thrifting with and she picked me up and dropped me off and she was kind enough to do that, which is really nice. Cuz if not, I would have had to walk and that was a really really nice thing of her to do. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I'm feeling proud of my ability to think but nothing but be creative and be aware of myself. And now I feel sometimes I just feel like I'm stealing out wisdom and I don't really know where it's coming from which I do but where did that come from? How how do I know that? So I'm very thankful that I have that within me and I'm very conscious of it cuz everyone has it within them. It's just being cautious or not conscious of it. But yeah, that's it. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	Well, since I have to work for 12 hours 14 hours something like that tomorrow. I think that my ideal day for regarding tomorrow would probably be a date and time. Incredibly exhausted because I'm going to the party tonight at 10:00, you know, I'm probably going to be out for a long time and I have work at 7:30 in the morning. So I'm and ideal tomorrow probably look like I'm not super exhausted and you know, I make some money just by doing the job. So yeah. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I am grateful for the experience of sitting down in the ice cream shop with Macy and sitting and talking about apartments next year. And you know, even though we really don't have much to talk about I always feel really comfortable around her. So that makes me really happy. So I am really grateful for that experience because you know, I felt really comfortable around her. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I feel like I did okay regarding time. I think I definitely could have done more things, you know, instead of sitting and watching a movie. I could have never read a book and I could have you know who got the scholarship but you know, other than that, I feel like I woke up early and I took the time to get ready and I feel like I think I'd use my time pretty wise today. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I think  I would say.  Even New Year's Eve for a little bit. You know, I hadn't really sat down and talked with anyone for a long time in a long time.  And you know, that was something I was kind of, you know, scratching the surface and dusting off and you know, sometimes it kind of felt a little uncomfortable because you know, I didn't really know Katie that well and so, you know, obviously it worked out well cuz now we're a lot closer than you know, we didn't then we were and that, you know, I got to express emotions. And as did she and you know, it was a really lovely conversation. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I can make better choices. I should probably bring a book to work so I can actually sit in like spend time, you know, acquiring knowledge rather than sitting on my phone and talking to people that I will never talk to you again green tender.  I can you know, I go to bed early eat well and yeah. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I would say to give yourself a break don't always be on your ass about.  everything 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I think my increased confidence has come from actually like kind of separating myself from the people. I had been usually spending my time with even if that means just my family in Wichita. I think just people in general and just kind of isolating myself to an extent and then it kind of stop living for other people and kind of just attending to my needs and realizing you know, what's important to me. What can I be working on right now? Not just really working on but what can I be, you know? Indulging in to better myself because it doesn't it's not living if I'm just sitting in wallowing in self-pity. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I feel thankful for staying with patience and kind of just waiting and making the most of the time that I had while waiting to hear back from Katie and Spencer and I didn't feel any anger or resentment towards the idea of not leaving immediately after work. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I think kindness towards  I think my physical health. I need to watch the money that I spend on food, and I need to eat a little better. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	There's some pretty good. I feel like I've done a great job of maintaining good friendships that you know, benefit me. That's the benefit that you know, make me feel good about myself. I've kind of not really talk to people that don't make me feel very good. I really made change really great friendships with those around me and I've maintained in contact with like my parents and my sister. 
ocXOroljpXhZHqPNxHC7DYXQDEp2	I was washing the dishes and kind of getting ready to go to sleep. 
oeLSjr7QgObxYbhdyr3VGLKPRyu1	I'm an investor in the company. 
oesTmnxk0bfD4yNlCtCzICiEzSW2	My health ain't good. That's the issue.  only kind of job I can probably get it standing on my feet and  my knees are bad. My legs are bad my back bad. I'm overweight.  So I'm just crap out of luck. 
oesTmnxk0bfD4yNlCtCzICiEzSW2	Just looking through the app store for a journal.

We have no money my husband he works as much as possible to make money, but we just don't have enough. My health is not good. So kind of hard for me to get a job. I don't have any transportation to go anywhere to even think about looking for a job. But like I said, my health ain't good. I can't stand on my feet.  I'm alone. I have no one to talk to.  My mom and my sister both passed away round about the same time.  I just feel like I have nobody in my life. That's all.

ofBGJMNMtZSwqOIZvp00w4JV5Ii1	I'm I'm confused what you're saying. 
ofBGJMNMtZSwqOIZvp00w4JV5Ii1	I think that it means that they're not comfortable in their own skin and being themselves living is totally fine. Everyone has to be that way but I think that it really helps you with your positive mindset and reaching your goals and being who you want to be in the future if you're not ashamed of your individuality. 
ofBGJMNMtZSwqOIZvp00w4JV5Ii1	like  it doesn't mean that.  You are any less of a person if you're not comfortable with yourself?  But it helps you understand.  The way you are supposed to be in who you are and how you're not supposed to be ashamed of who you are because you are you and that's good enough. That's more than good enough. 
ofBGJMNMtZSwqOIZvp00w4JV5Ii1	Well, I'm sitting here thinking about a boy who I don't have any chance with because he doesn't care about me. I think and my dad is in the hospital and he left a long time ago, but my mom got a call.  and  He's nice to you, and I can't do anything and I feel like my stomach's in knots.  And I just can't think anymore. I can't think straight because those two situations of the only two I ever think about. 
ofBGJMNMtZSwqOIZvp00w4JV5Ii1	I think just anxiety.  Not knowing what to do. 
ofBGJMNMtZSwqOIZvp00w4JV5Ii1	Well, I've been doing all the school.  Now that I really enjoy it, but it kind of gets my mind off of things.  I  draw sometimes hang out with friends.  I just got back from a lock in at church. I was fun. 
ofBGJMNMtZSwqOIZvp00w4JV5Ii1	Yeah, Luke makes me nervous.  So this going to happen with Luke makes me nervous honestly because I'm in love with him and he has loved me back. And so I think what if no one ever loves me back. 
ofBGJMNMtZSwqOIZvp00w4JV5Ii1	I only spend money like a ton of money. But I mean, I like my clothes and that's one thing I like is to my money on not that my parents makes me any less or more of a person but I really do enjoy like fashion. 
ofBGJMNMtZSwqOIZvp00w4JV5Ii1	I'm yeah, they're trendsetter lb a lot of people like my style the way I dress and stuff and I'm really kind of people and people tend to be kind of towards me and towards other people when they're around me when  I tell them about like my values. 
ofBGJMNMtZSwqOIZvp00w4JV5Ii1	I'm like  I really you can it's hard to explain like I I have strength like in like my mind like I can persevere and do things and at the same time like I'm very I have very good understanding of what my individuality is. Like I am not ashamed to be  myself 
ofBGJMNMtZSwqOIZvp00w4JV5Ii1	Well, I just live with my mom. So my parent I guess.  makes makes me more of  a hard worker 
ofBGJMNMtZSwqOIZvp00w4JV5Ii1	Yeah.  I think I could be. 
ofBGJMNMtZSwqOIZvp00w4JV5Ii1	stressed  anxious  sad  hopeless

pYDGozvOLqP92ckxIkfreU4NwID2	Hi Remy, I just had an okay day. It was just another day of work. I just always have a lot of mind.  I'm a first grade teacher and there's a lot of stress and I feel like  life has just been repetitive and I just work and work and work and  the kids are stressing me out today.  There's a lot going on and I was tired and  just wondering kind of ball. 
pYDGozvOLqP92ckxIkfreU4NwID2	A nice cool. I would like to set for myself tomorrow is to get all my grades in and to be as productive as possible in the workplace that my classroom at my school. 
pYDGozvOLqP92ckxIkfreU4NwID2	I would say hi there. I would introduce myself and tell them my name is Jaime Arroyo. I'm a first grade teacher and I work a charter school, and I'm a pretty chill person. 
pYDGozvOLqP92ckxIkfreU4NwID2	Well, it was just sort of a regular day. Although I did have less kids today at work and it was all right. It was just another day of work and I just feel like there's something missing. So that's why I feel dull. 
pYDGozvOLqP92ckxIkfreU4NwID2	I guess for me.  I just need a lot more positivity and I'm looking forward to hopefully some blessings in my life and  I really want a good place to live and a good one job.  I hope it happens when I get scared. 
pYDGozvOLqP92ckxIkfreU4NwID2	I want to see you today was a pretty good day. And I was successful in Bloomington my lesson plans and my kids had a good day. I did get a lot of paperwork done for alfredo. And right now I would like to accomplish more than on a daily basis.

pYDGozvOLqP92ckxIkfreU4NwID2	I'm a sweet girl, and I just want to be happy in life and  my friends my job and features important to me. 
pYDGozvOLqP92ckxIkfreU4NwID2	I'm guessing I might get to have this job and I just found out my best friend had her baby and I'm very excited and happy for her. I just wish I wasn't just so tired. 
pYDGozvOLqP92ckxIkfreU4NwID2	I guess because I work every day and it's something that's important and I don't really get to see my friends all the time as much as I would like. 
pYDGozvOLqP92ckxIkfreU4NwID2	The fact that I really behave so old today had me over the moon. 
pYDGozvOLqP92ckxIkfreU4NwID2	I really want my own house me home, please. It's really exciting. And we also know how beautiful place of my own.  I just want to meet me in person.  But then I don't want to be alone either. I just want to find a good personal partner to share it with.

pZlkAiaasZOPmkcnHH5mTyOcfjr1	He left.  I moved out in November.  and it has been really hard for the both of us since 
pZlkAiaasZOPmkcnHH5mTyOcfjr1	Today Daniel left to go back to Fargo.  Daniel is my boyfriend who doesn't live here, but we used to live together for 6 years.  We went through a rough patch and he decided to move away.  And so they needed some space. We had not talked in about three weeks and he came to town on Friday.  And we both decided that we can't walk out of each other's life and never talk to each other again because we still love each other very much and we want to work things out. So we have decided that we are back together, but working on our issues separately for now.  and there was discussion of me moving to Fargo soon so that we can  we're kind of issues together at some point.  But sometimes he text me somewhere things, but I think that he's going through some really tough emotional stuff and he's not good at communicating.  So sometimes it comes across.  Worrisome are weird and I'm trying to use my thought therapy and my cognitive behavioral therapy to work on myself so that I can better control my responses.  And remember that I ultimately do love him and always want to come from a place of Love regardless of what he says or does.  And that's been kind of a tough thing to do but it's getting there and I'm working on it and hopefully we can work everything out and become stronger because the alternative option is to end things with each other just to start things with other people at some point.  Who will eventually go bad?  Or the situation will go bad and we're just stuck in the same spot. So why not be stuck with each other when we know that we love each other this much and that were willing to go through this hard stuff for each other.  , the next person we're with we might not be willing to do that with or might not feel the same.  level of love for

And I work towards making myself better.  So that I can be better for other people and help them. 
pZlkAiaasZOPmkcnHH5mTyOcfjr1	I have found that through this situation with Daniel I have lost.  track of my  ability to keep my emotions in check and to not want to control other people or other people's decisions.  I have been working for the last 3 months on thought therapy.  And I have been working for the last 2 weeks on cognitive behavioral therapy to help me to refocus my thoughts and not let my thoughts get out of control.  And cause me to have adverse emotions, which caused me to react and unhealthy ways.

pumO62C4zMhG9lWyNl13sHeRyh93	What a nerd even talked about her. That's a little bit rude. I didn't even see that. She was a piece of meat and talk about anyone. Like I did like I talk about them in like a really nice way. I did not call you in a piece of me or try to find them as a piece of me. That's really rude. 
pumO62C4zMhG9lWyNl13sHeRyh93	my dad sometimes  maybe it's me and my sister bothers him and he can be really angry. 
pumO62C4zMhG9lWyNl13sHeRyh93	Cuz that way I feel like I don't have to do much stuff at be easier for me. Then I'd be happier. I get to talk to my friends. I get to update my social profile.  Oh my God, what is my sister doing?

She was years for pinion.  And she's always looking for me wondering about me and she's just super nice.  and another person that would be grateful for is probably grateful for happy we create for  Add bumpers my head, but I can't see. Her who who is I was thinking about that Sheila?  She doesn't care about popularity because it. I'm on the back roads were in the hot he knew I was having all that good of a day and she and she asked me the back and she's also she she also dresses me a lot which is a good sign because she probably because I'm a good friend that you got to tell me everything about her and I love her and he could practice basketball with his really funny and she's just really good to talk to and we both play the same instrument except I'm a level above her because I've started earlier than her but she's out of show you like today.

pumO62C4zMhG9lWyNl13sHeRyh93	one simple thing that I'm grateful for  Oshkosh sleeping, but that one supposed to go for  having a great sand big family.  The reason I like the simple thing is because honestly everyone in my family is like my best friend even like my sister and my beer which can be like a little annoying sometimes but I'd say everyone is my best friend like in my family.  I can't trust anyone there. I really like everyone there.  And yeah.  Also grateful I was a simple thing that I am grateful for is my volleyball team, but I do not have them anymore. But when I did have them are very grateful because I had pretty fun really fun. I had a really fun time with them at practices and games and oh my God, the last part of it was awesome recall like this huge bag of snacks when we sat in the sun together and eat like our snacks and we played volleyball and when I got to know some of my teammates very good. I got some relief balm and get close to them. 
pumO62C4zMhG9lWyNl13sHeRyh93	so this is probably the most common response probably everybody says that does this but I think about the phone is which I'm using this very second are the  the  my fever advance in technology that I'm grateful for.  More each time I use it because like I really do anything with the bottom so you can like chat with friends online. You can FaceTime friends. You can upload your social upgrade your social profile and you can watch useful stuff could really do anything honestly. So that's my favorite as my favorite little technological development. 
pumO62C4zMhG9lWyNl13sHeRyh93	I can release her or anger and replace it with joy. 
pumO62C4zMhG9lWyNl13sHeRyh93	So I'm basically today. I'm very glad I got closer to my friend Gina.  I am requesting them now and I feel like I have a really good friend group and stuff and  I'm trying to have a crush, but I don't know who have a crush on.  Something about this one guy, but I don't know maybe not very much like me back my ear.  Anyways, other than that, I'm really sad that I'm not on the basketball team like all of my friends are that that means it's kind of sad but I've never practiced this I like after school with another girl would make it and yeah, I thought I did pretty well down there to spell diplomatic mean unhappy.

Playing sports just on us like going outside, you know playing stuff going to do stuff going to new things going to stores.  Going out to buy a new food, you know anything just not like seeing inside and doing nothing.  You know in like just being lonely. 
pumO62C4zMhG9lWyNl13sHeRyh93	I don't know what adhere means. I'm just going to guess that means the same values that you can put your friends to have 200 some values that I expect my friends.  To have to be honest knost of my friends have scrunchies cuz I have to be like kind of a VSCO girl like, you know what I'm talking about and they and I'd like most of my friends to have Vans is just for the look and hourly Henry. How are the cute way here color? They had like I'm like, I have friends with all different hair colors, then ice. I want them to at least be my height.  Because I don't like small friends cuz that just like that just makes me look like I'm having friends like a kindergartner something or someone much younger than me. So another thing that I could but my friends. Is definitely humor and they really have to care and not have like favoritism unless it's for me an hour and they have to be humble. Definitely nice.  and  play have to hear from me a lot so much already said that but I can't really think of anything, but that's it. Sorry. It's my mom. 
pumO62C4zMhG9lWyNl13sHeRyh93	what keeps been going each day probably like  my my friends  like the people I talk to if like they're like not being hard with me. I'm just having next week conversations and like Bond bonding with them. Well, and honestly, that's the best day ever. And another thing that keeps me going is just simple work and he honestly is my top number one answers just talking to people and talk to people and like getting to know them better and like sinking and that there are really good friend and they and they like you as a friend to you know, 
pumO62C4zMhG9lWyNl13sHeRyh93	If I if I never had to work a day in my life, I would probably just I know sit around at home and I would play sports.  I would also hang out with my friends.  My hands where else would I do? I would hang out with my sister and my family much more. 
pumO62C4zMhG9lWyNl13sHeRyh93	If I had the ability to eliminate one of my fears, I would do my phobia of ghosts and just dead Spirits are that nonliving still spirits that like Chrome around the house because I don't know. I've watched a lot of scary movies but like horror and haunted houses that are really freaky and sometimes I don't know. I'm just scared to like in the dark because of that or like the Sybaris, but I'm going to the shower or a bathroom. Sometimes I'm scared to close my door and I don't really like that because I kind of need my privacy and I just be better off not being scared of a Spirits. So that's why I if I were granted the ability to eliminate one of my fears, I would choose.  my fear of ghosts or any looking spirits 
pumO62C4zMhG9lWyNl13sHeRyh93	I go to school at Ronald Ronald Reagan Elementary and I am in sixth grade. I'm going to learn next year, but I'm going to stay there for one year, and I think he had just one year and then when I'm about to the summer of 2021 summer of 2021 I  I'm going to move or not really sure yet, but on this but also in the summer of 2020 you were going to live in Hawaii for a month and they're going to live with me. So again, and then we're going to it we don't know yet, but some weird and the Southern, California. 
pumO62C4zMhG9lWyNl13sHeRyh93	away  the way I think it's actually not a problem for me.  I wish I mean like one thing that I would wish.  Be gone and would not be a problem is probably.  my skin I wish I could have thicker skin, you know and  and not be so sensitive and I wish that I was better at talking and just replying to other people.  Yeah, that's mainly it. 
pumO62C4zMhG9lWyNl13sHeRyh93	Sorry my phone fell.  I'm so much do I get from volleyball? I'm actually got a lot of experience especially from running, especially by learning from my friends and for my searches.  How much did you get for my box? So I also got some?  I love my family proud because I got my older cousin that's like a lot older than me proud because she also plays volleyball and she's the best person on the team and she was like at the first one in the family that I told cuz she really knows about volleyball like he's really good at it and my grandparents were really impressed. Like I kept talking about it for like a week then they can play volleyball game and that volleyball game Xchange like three times and they went over perfectly and I hit every bump over on the net and said that was pretty cool. I like I was really blessed that  Then I won't be surprised you actually it's listening to you. Cuz like how do you say that your snow person behind the screen the Ashley's like that's like asking questions and if there was not be like it's saying like, you know what I mean, but yeah, another thing that I did get from volleyball is some new friends or Alexa or like some new kind of friends.  Cayenne  I got to bond with some people like what I said in the last conversation. 
pumO62C4zMhG9lWyNl13sHeRyh93	Honestly, I just came out of my shell after being social started talking to everyone started having a good conversation starting started or not to be funny and a femur and learning how to talk and you know, keep the conversation flowing. 
pumO62C4zMhG9lWyNl13sHeRyh93	I have no idea but that is a money is something one of my friends which I was like a little bit mad at you cuz she like to be out of her group. And now know she just made me feel very alone cuz cuz I don't know.  She's just not allowing me and then right after I left her from your peace just like oh, where were you were looking all over for you?  Will you come with us again? And I was just like okay next day just don't start ignoring her at all. Really ignoring but I was just like I don't know.  Like I'm not like you don't try to talk to them that much like anyways, she went to the hospital today because she got pneumonia.  And I'm sure she could have died from requested it because I just realized that she was a really good friend. She's always there for me and I was a little bit rude. So yeah, I bet she don't go to school tomorrow. So  Let us do something that I'm the question reminded me of but I have no idea how long it take to get to the hospital. 
pumO62C4zMhG9lWyNl13sHeRyh93	Wait, you're actually listening to my conversations cuz I've had actually what I said shouldn't use your social update. Yeah, it does use my social update have a lot of social things on this trustee found. I have Tik Tok I Snapchat you have Instagram. I have iMessage FaceTime call my step table on my old phone, but I don't know you have a lot of stuff. 
pumO62C4zMhG9lWyNl13sHeRyh93	no, actually  you look a little bit. I don't know if this is considered often.  But I visit my family about once or twice a month most likely once a month.  And then I get to bond with my friends five times a week cuz that's how many days were at school my God. Can you call my sister? So annoying? I'm going to stop talking now cuz he's actually so annoying i k o my God, I'm actually not funny. I'm so sorry. I apologize. Like Mike wouldn't have to do that. Like what's the point of doing that like, that's really annoying.  Play oh my God. 
pumO62C4zMhG9lWyNl13sHeRyh93	And would you like to know how many questions you like to ask you? I don't know. I don't really care I could get to be Annie. 
pumO62C4zMhG9lWyNl13sHeRyh93	I have no idea what you're talking about. I did not say anything about my mom having a crush on this Henry, dude. 
pumO62C4zMhG9lWyNl13sHeRyh93	Prayer example smoking is a really bad addiction, you know, like a lot of people are addicted to smoking and let's like nearly impossible to just quit like it. So it's just so fantastic to everyone like some people can't live with cigarettes.  But yeah, that's one of the the most horrible addictions like no one wants to get addicted to that. Like that's a bad thing to get addicted to you like that could look really real your longest. Yeah, that's one thing that you never want to be addicted to but you know.  I guess it's better not to be addicted to anything because I feel like if you're addicted to something it was just like  FaceTime like you just like not have enough time or I don't know. I feel like you want to have any time to spend with like your friends or your family because you're too thick to do this one thing. So if you were addicted to everything, maybe you could be worse social maybe. I'm talk a lot more. Maybe we can hang out with our fellow family members and our fellow friends. 
pumO62C4zMhG9lWyNl13sHeRyh93	That would actually be very cool.  Tybee very nice, because I get sick like a lot like every time I go to my grandma's house I either like throw up and get diarrhea or something.  I just get like a really bad stomach ache.  Yeah, I actually get sick a lot and I just really hate it. But the one good thing about being sick is that you get to skip school.  But it's nice. I like it be much better. If you didn't get sick like they're they're probably be more people in the world have heard nothing about that. If there was more people in the world have a much bigger dump.  Yeah, cuz basically most people die from being sick or like hatching something like pneumonia.  I like yeah, just getting sick. That's how then that's how some people die. A lot of people actually and if you had the ability to not get sick if he left with steps.  This year or like in Forever?  sciatica nice have more people in this world because I already like the people in this world right now like  Having twice of that would be awesome. But also it kind of be scary for our Earth. 
pumO62C4zMhG9lWyNl13sHeRyh93	Well if Earth was flat then we probably wouldn't have that good of climate probably and I went to this guy's I feel like they want to be as huge.  How does really rich imagine if it's also weird to imagine the Earth as a sphere or like the circle?  but like it'd be better if it was a circle and it is a circle, but I just be weird if it was flat like  I don't know. I feel like you just fall through the Earth if it was flat, like if you'd like a whole like all the way to the bottom of the Earth.  And you would just fall through.  You know that doesn't make sense. But like I don't want to slide no one wants the Earth flag. Just be weird. I like our that's a circle or sphere whatever you call it.  But I feel like if the Earth was flat and we probably have smaller homes. Just I feel like there'd be less people since it's a lot now and it doesn't contain that much of a towel surface.  Or that much of shelter or you know things that people need to live.  things that people need to have to live our supplies, you know. I just feel like it because on the only if it was flat  and if you just very weird cuz he would wander the flat my flight be squashed. It was flat.  Or maybe we would have asked I maybe you could just have a surface cuz it's so flat. 
pumO62C4zMhG9lWyNl13sHeRyh93	It's the world we live in it was actually a simulation. It wouldn't be that much fun. Cuz I feel like everything would be like fake. I just not be thought cool anymore because everything is just so weird, and I don't know.  But like you don't have to pretend like you can do like whatever you want with that that would just be better and having our world being a simulation. 
pumO62C4zMhG9lWyNl13sHeRyh93	How my surrounding environment I'm thankful for my friends my family. I am thankful for having the house. I'm thankful for having a clean house. I'm thankful for having a beautiful backyard with first a trampoline second a pool and like kids and we had this one game. I think it's called Fizz ball. Yeah, foosball foosball. Yeah, it's called foosball. And I also have a front yard with this grass field that I can just play volleyball in a not sometimes when I was on like my school survival team out set up a nut and then I play volleyball with my dad. Yeah, it's been nice cuz I had games every week for volleyball and it just really helps me for to prepare.  By practicing that it was good cuz I had enough space.  And another thing that is surrounding my environment that I am thankful to enjoy is.  Is my bathtub my bathtub because I just love taking showers and the refrigerator are a cozy blankets and ropes cuz you make me feel so much cool over. Colder cuz I'm always like so cool at night because I'm sleeping on the couch in the living room. I don't have heaters.  so  like the blankets don't really do anything. So that's why I'm thankful for a robe.  Cuz my robe is fuzzy. It's new to I just got it yesterday for my mom just bought it.  And I can't think of anything else where else I think. That's surrounding my environment.  I guess.  education  In-N-Out nature  cuz  they help us breathe and produces oxygen we need oxygen or else he wouldn't live. I don't want to be here. You wouldn't be here. This app will never exist. If we didn't have a freaking tree or any plant for that matter. 
pumO62C4zMhG9lWyNl13sHeRyh93	I could erase one memory from my mind is when my friends kept telling my used to be Crush that I liked him. And then he said and he I think he thought it was funny so I can.  Message me saying that.  He likes me and I thought it was true. But then he said that it was a joke. So now those little bit clownish. But yeah, I just thought it was embarrassing and I kind of wish that never happened. So that's why I would erase that one memory completely from my mind. 
pumO62C4zMhG9lWyNl13sHeRyh93	If I was a teacher, I would probably teach C language because I'm going to get a language. I am very good at memorizing stuff and I'm I just like correcting sentences like honor morning work and class. My favorite thing is to do like this instance. It's like the only take me like three seconds like it's just really call me and then soothing to me. I just really like the language is very easy for me very, you know, how soothing I just love it. And yeah, that's why I would teach language. 
pvGKENChyucZMKjyPyaJgyruHt32	My life is like a never-ending roller coaster.  With all the ups and the downs and twists and the turns and the gut-wrenching feeling that you're going to fall off the edge.  But yet in the same.  instance  I feel grounded by my kids and my husband.  They're pretty much the only things.  Holding me there when I get off of this roller coaster.

qKgDXx5sRyQXS5VMrJqeETr96Hg1	I commit to bring the best version of myself
qKgDXx5sRyQXS5VMrJqeETr96Hg1	To feel more motivated and positive
qKgDXx5sRyQXS5VMrJqeETr96Hg1	When it needs it my body needs some rest and relaxation
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	I work from home to have more flexibility and have access to taking care of my daughter more effectively.
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	I think there are several kind people, it’s just that we hear about the negatives.
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	I felt unseen, unheard, and needed to have something to look forward to.
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	Yes I do, I am working on finding a therapist.
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	Sometimes I think so, sometimes I think it be a little more challenging to take care of a child as I know I carry the heavy lifting for some of the stuff at home. So, it’s a tossup.
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	I really don’t know, to be honest. I think I was looking for attention and love and looked in the wrong place. I’m ashamed and embarrassed of that.
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	It’s amazing you ask me this, but I actually think the way the couches position right now isn’t pleasing enough toward the TV.
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	What do you mean a piece of this
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	I don’t understand what that means
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	For me, the physical element is working out. The mental element is meditating while being in the steam room. Also, reading simulates my mental state. Add to the mental state, my class I’m working on. Oh, oh, oh! And of course, apply for jobs!
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	"Sometimes I feel as if what I’m complaining about hurt real problems. But I cannot control how I feel. I do feel resentful, disappointed, and unfulfilled. I don’t know if I should just except these as a temporary state, or look for ways to solve them all the time? Sometimes resisting what I feel can feel more challenging than simply excepting it.

I just feel like there’s so much I wanted to do, and I’m unable to do it now. I sometimes miss the days when I had A lot of time and didn’t have to make an effort in a relationship."
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	"1. Start my own company - Llc 

2. Find 2 new clients 

3.  Stop resisting what is - people and situations 

4. Find a job to help support my own Company. From now on it won’t be work defining me but how I can get my goals achieved and learn while earning. 

5. Start recourse with my back - preventative and strengthening. 

6. Use my evenings more wisely - read, connect with loved ones, and learn. 

7. Take a vacation internationally. "
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	My thought was how I can decorate Aanya’s room for the cheap, but we aren’t spending money so it’s a moot point.
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	"New idea I had was to make time for me. I left Kevin at home and did my own thing. Granted, it wasn’t a pedi at the end but I took some
Time while driving to look into buying running shoes and getting my new glasses. "
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	My new ideas was researching putting Aanya in toddler swim classes as well as committing to doing something fun and different every week with her. I’m realizing I need to introduce her to new experiences. As far as my own thoughts and experiences, I didn’t have many. I was pretty proud of myself for putting together that budget yesterday and I’ve been working on adhering to it. I didn’t even order food today
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	I didn’t have much time to think about things that are interesting, but if I had to really put my mind to it, it was the sheer act of putting a piece of technology together.
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	This is a wonderful reminder. I often look externally for things to make me happy, but I need to work on things internally. I would say, perhaps getting some rest, and noting my thoughts in a journal with action plans are things I can do for self-care today. I don’t like to simply vent, but also have a solution to some of the things that I find challenging.
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	It’s going OK, I think what kind of brings me down is the fact that I get up at night and I ruminate about things. Things I’m not satisfied with in my relationship, things I need to do, things I’m not doing with my life, the connections on missing, when you add all that together, no matter how much sleeping stuff I tried to use in order to sleep, it just doesn’t work.
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	I will ask Hale worry and your confidence I will exhale worry inhale confidence exhale worry inhale confidence
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	I will nurture my self-confidence and achieve my goals. I will make time for things that matter and make time for my goals. I will stop watching so much TV and work on my goals. If there’s a will there’s a way. I have that drive, I will make it happen. I will achieve my goals.
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	No one is in control of my life except for me. No one can control my reactions, only me. No one can control my thoughts, only me. No one can control my reaction to things, only me.
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	I accept praise without criticizing myself I accept praise without any rebuttal. I will except praise where it is due. I deserve praise.
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	The truth of the matter is, I don’t like sharing a bed at all. That’s why I take as many sleep supporting agents as I do. I wake up feeling hot sometimes, and adding to that the fact that my mind is racing, I don’t sleep consistently well.
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	I’m strangely excited about organizing. I’m also excited about getting away and going to the gym for a little bit.
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	I’m looking forward to finalizing the budget that we have planned as well as taking steps towards spending less money to make myself happy
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	I am kind of looking forward to doing a little nonalcoholic champagne and cheese night with Kevin.
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	Sadly, I’m not looking forward to much today. Is that a bad thing?
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	I’m actually looking forward to some quiet time without Aanya. So I can focus on some of the things I need to get done and practice self-care.
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	I'm looking forward to  feeling more about life. 
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	"Baby monitoring science

qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	I’m looking forward to monitoring them on a monthly basis and seeing how well I am doing towards these goals.
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	Sadly it was unwinding for bed with my sleepy stuff 
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	The best part of today was feeding Aanya and apple and realizing she can actually chew the hard fruit.
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	It was keeping our grocery bill under $100. I was pretty proud of that.
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	I am a unique individual. I am a unique individual. I am a unique individual.
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	I know what I'm doing, Everything will be okay.  I know what I'm doing, Everything will be okay.  I know what I'm doing, Everything will be okay. I know what I'm doing. Everything will be okay. 
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	I will embrace everything that life throws my way. I will except that life has its ups and downs and embrace anything that comes my way. I will embrace the power of impermanence and except anything that comes my way.
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	I will never quit I will never quit never quit on myself
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	I know it is possible to turn off the negative I will focus on the positive I want to focus on the positive to not the negative
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	Are used to love running a lot. But now I do it just to stay fit. I do enjoy lifting weights as well. If I had the time, I would try different classes also.
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	I honestly enjoy watching movies I’ve seen before, reading, or just napping. Sometimes aimlessly surfing the Internet and learning new things is something that helps relax me as well. I try to keep the surfing on the Internet thing to a minimum, though.
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	I don’t know if that would be the ideal situation. First off, the world would be overpopulated. Secondly, there would be no appreciation and the concept of impermanence. I don’t believe we Truly appreciate others and things we have. I don’t think there’s enough resources in this beautiful world of ours to accommodate never ending life.
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	Set the purpose. Set the intentions. Make it happen. 
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	I’m probably doing the same old thing every day. I’m not introducing new things into my life. I’m not learning new things. I’m simply trying to stay above water with all the things I need to do around the house. I know it sounds depressing, but that’s how I feel right now.
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	"Today seemed endless. I often feel bad, when I’m home with Aanya for a whole day, I’m super tired and overwhelmed. I’ve come to realize, to remind fullness, that I resist what it is. I want to make sure the house is as perfect as possible so that I could have some shrivel of control over my day. This is often impossible with a small child who likes to mess things up. So, I resist what it is and I get myself all warmed up.

I woke up super tired, I just didn’t sleep well last night. I’m pretty sure it was taking the running stimulants pretty late and then not drinking water. I even took a couple melatonin to help seal the deal, but it didn’t help.

Adding the exhaustion to the need to control the day, I often feel overwhelmed. I just miss the days when I had the time to do things for myself. Hell, even washing my hair I was a challenge with Aanya today.

Apart from that, I didn’t really do much. Kevin really took care of me by making a nice dinner – salad and bread, and I had some yogurt.

I have to start making time for myself and my goals. I feel like my life Has taken a backseat to priorities that don’t seem to amount to anything.

I also put pressure on myself to be a good mom, and develop on you as effectively as possible. I feel like I’m failing in that department."
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	I just don’t feel challenged… I feel like staying at home as a mother is not us for filling for me as I’d like. I know, it’s be careful what you wish for with working and taking care of a child, but I need some stimulation for my mind. I just feel like I’m doing things for everyone else very little reward.
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	Similar to other days, I feel like I do a lot but then get nothing done. Aanya is getting a cold, I drugged up to sleep, and highlight was that I did go run today.
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	I feel as if I stay at home with a child means getting a lot done but never getting enough done… So, essentially I don’t get the things I really want to get done complete, but a lot of stuff gets done in the time goes by fast.
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	My priority is taking care of Aanya, I exposed her to some new activities, worked out, and even tried to nap a little.
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	Just shopping, getting nye planned, and gym time. The basics. 
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	"Well most of these milestones are tangible. Actually creating the LLC means having all the prep work on the business plan behind my business done first. It involves the financial assessment, logo creation, and the other areas such as getting a mentor. These will be my main stores for this.

The acceptance one will be a little harder to measure. This will be the outcome of therapy and such.

The vacation will happen when it’s scheduled."
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	I feel thankful for my continued determination and trying to make things better across life. From my job, to bettering my relationships at home.
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	I feel challenged that I am stuck and don’t have time to do things that I’d ideally like to do. But I’m grateful for that reason of being stuck is my beautiful daughter Aanya. I need to be grateful for her except that my life is changed. It doesn’t have to change and be a 180° change though. I have to embrace and find balance to make time for myself. Even the small thought of doing my nails this morning was good
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	I am actually grateful for a theme, the show friends that helps me get a smile on my face throughout the day when things get a little challenging.
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	I’m enjoying the view that our apartment and provides for us right now. I enjoy the fact that it’s comfortable enough to practically stay here all the time. Have a nice TV. Decent furniture, and abundance of good and healthy food.
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	I’m honestly grateful to be able to step away and get some me time, primarily due to the fact that we have the nest WebCam.
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	"I’m sitting here, after dropping Aanya off to daycare. I have to admit, it feels good to have moments of stillness and peace. Don’t get me wrong, I love and adore my daughter. But the constant demand and attention required of a toddler I can get exhausting. I can sit here, ADP’s, do some deep breathing, and focus on my own items to do today. I don’t find a selfish at all.

I often wonder if Kevin feels the same way about my having Aanya and daycare. But you know what, I don’t give a fuck about what he thinks. Because, This is about me and my own self care.

I want to find things to focus on doing that are related to me. I want to work on my class today, work on developing a budget, and actually just find some time to do me. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that. Savoring a nice cup of tea, or hot chocolate, making myself a nice lunch, working out, these are all the things that I enjoy doing."
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	Made dinner with hubby for nye, got some gym time in, cleaned, and took a moment to reflect. 
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	I don’t feel it is right now. 
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	"Today is a day to continue to re-shift and refocus my happiness and state of mind. It’s time to except that I’m not always going to be happy, and that’s OK. I often wake up feeling overwhelmed and stuck with not having time to do the things I want to do. I did sneak away and have a small work out while Aanya was napping. And wasn’t the safest thing to do, and I worried that she may wake up. I am going to buy an asked WebCam and keep it in her bedroom so I can keep an ion her while going downstairs to work out.

I found out I didn’t get that job that I interviewed for with the lunch a couple weeks ago. There’sA part of me that takes reaction so personally, but in this situation my intuition during the interview told me that it wouldn’t be a good fit. It doesn’t seem like the guy knew what he wanted, or I just wasn’t the right fit for him. By the sounds of them hiring a CMO instead of a marketing manager, my gut was right.

I’m really looking forward to investing time in this journal and have focused time on trying to find a therapist as well. 2020 is going to bring better sense of peace for me. Acceptance with what is, and stopping of putting my life on the back burner."
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	I’m planning on doing our family budget, doing some cleaning, working out, and planning out my cleanse for the month. Perhaps a little rest as well
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	Today basically consists of making sure on your feels good enough and rest to fight her cold. I also have the same cold and so does Kevin. Probably run some errands and then go to the gym. Actually Gym is right after Aanya in terms of priority and appointments
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	I have so much to accomplish, but it always seems like I don’t have the time to do it. Tending to a child full-time three days a week is incredibly challenging. I did manage to get one small accomplishment of organizing the bathroom cabinet today. I need to work on organizing the closet next. I will need to work out and go get some groceries, typical stay at home mom duties.
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	My goals today are to work on my class, return Amazon packages, and get some me time via Gym and possibly steam room.
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	Health, being there to see aanya grow 
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	I feel grateful for the knowledge to be scrappy enough to explore and research things to do for Aanya. I also feel grateful to have started a book on entrepreneurship, to keep myself motivated towards my own goals.
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	I’ve been given good health, a miracle of a child at 42, caring husband, the comfort to not worry about finances, living in a nice part of town, having shelter, having food, god there’s so much to be grateful for is in there?
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	I’m the thankful for conversation and connection. I’m thankful I got to spend tj e evening with Kevin and try a new lobster recipe. I’m thankful for cuddling with aanya and reading her a story. 
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	Not all of them. Just a few. 
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	"Honesty
Integrity
Inspirational 
moral
Helpful 
Stable "
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	My driving motivation behind these resolutions is to become a better person, go after the ambitions I put on hold for so long… I feel I’ve chased after the wrong dreams for so long, and to connect with Kevin.
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	I plan on devoting some time to finding a new therapist. I’m also came off a freelance project with Mila.
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	"On the outside, it would be better management and smarter investing, so I can set myself and my family up for life.

Internally, it would be optimal emotional intelligence."
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	It would be the day I decided to do those things in my teen years that I wished I had never done.
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	Accepting what is, mindfulness. Therapy. 
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	I will not allow my mind to believe my body. I will not allow my negative thoughts to bully my existence. I will not allow my mind to bully my body. I will not let my negative thoughts take away from the abundance I have.
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	I am happy with my body. I’ve lost all the weight from Pregnancy. I could focus on things that I can control like my diet. I can use my workout time as a time of reflection from my self.
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	I will nurture my body today because I love and deserve to treat myself well. I will nurture and nourish my body today because I love myself enough to do so. I will not share my body with physical activity, nourish myself with healthy food, not forgetting to eat, and relax my mind. Because I love myself.
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	My body can do some amazing things. My body has miraculously given me a human being. My body has miraculously snapped back after several injuries. My body is capable of healing itself. This cold shall pass, because my body can heal itself. My body can manage to sleep on that song. My body will survive without sleep aids.
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	My body is my home, I must protect it and keep it clean and maintained like I do my home.
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	Probably share them with my husband and close friends. That’s really about it. I’ll pick selectively on who I share my goals with. I don’t want to many people knowing and too many cooks in the kitchen.
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	I don’t know if I believe in God per se, but I do believe in a higher power and the act of faith and karma. Basically, doing good on to others and treating each other with respect.
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	The world needs kindness, compassion, and understanding. These three things with poppy and to so many wars, violence, and even more.
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	Most likely when aanya sleeps  this afternoon.
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	I live in Chicago Illinois
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	It’s our family budget, I feel that we’ve been spending too much money… More so me… And I want to have a better lens into how to manage our funds better.
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	"I think things I could take responsibility for our outside the resentment factor. Well, let me take that back, I’m not practicing acceptance with Kevin. I’m frustrated that I feel like I’m carrying the heavy weight of taking care of our daughter. While I understand logically why that is at this time, and that it is temporary, I’m still tired and exhausted.

As far as the lack of fulfillment in my life, I am not excepting the fact that my life is changed. I don’t have a career or social connections on a consistent basis To drive me. The truth of it is that that is who I am, I need that drive and stimulation from building something that his career or goal oriented.

I feel bad the day-to-day things I’m doing are not as fulfilling. I wish I can say I enjoy every moment of parenthood. But it’s a constant feeling of not being in the present moment and thinking about all the things I need to do. That’s just who I am, I’m a planner. There’s always something to do, two people to clean up after and feed, and I feel like no one takes care of me."
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	Even though Aanya was sick, I will cherish cuddling with her for a half hour.
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	Sometimes, I don’t know. I need to demand more time for myself, and use time away from Aanya to do things more nurturing for myself and my mind. Right now, it’s just doing chores and going to the gym. That’s simply not enough for me. Don’t forget, I do need to add rest in there too.
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	I just feel like I don’t have time anymore. And anytime I have that is for me, I feel obligated to share this with another person. I know this sounds so bad coming out loud, but it’s the truth. Perhaps I need to be more purposeful and making sure I get time for myself.
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	Well, that’s far, I feel resentment. I feel like something is lacking in my life. I feel as if I spend all this time doing things that don’t nurture me and my goals. I find this happens every day and it’s like a hamster wheel.
qLL13fdDcrasnpOz9ydbfGhlViu1	I feel thankful that I don’t have to feel as guilty for eating a brownie in the morning because I’ll work it off later. I’m thankful for my metabolism and help. I’m thankful that my hair is looking nice today. Thankful that I will get a breather to myself today to relax my body
qLjhWVtXicf1VFSdoDQeH4afemW2	Could you please show you how you wrote you a song?  I have no idea what that means. 
qLjhWVtXicf1VFSdoDQeH4afemW2	I feel grateful today in general.

qLjhWVtXicf1VFSdoDQeH4afemW2	First of all, my friend is so annoying. I know I keep saying my friend mom's I give her name's my friend. Jessica is super annoying. Okay, she's doing her nails while it ain't even while I don't even know but I did my interview today and I'm feeling like I always feel when I do something important like, oh my God, I want to hide it's embarrassing. I hate myself. I wish you were having me over I wish months ago by so now I'm sitting here all by myself, but not really into my life and just because in the front of me on my camera just doing her nails is watching TV in the background. And I feel super alone and weird and off and I don't know how to articulate that and usually I will call my mom but I seriously don't want to talk to my family because I feel like all they do is make it worse and make me feel horrible about myself and maybe that's the thing. Maybe I feel horrible right now because the routine is I do something people make me feel horrible and that it was as what's happening. But since I don't have anybody with me for her Bloomfield Harbor for myself, and so I just got to get used to keep going and celebrating myself. So I'm going to turn it back around and say however, I did on that fucking interview. At least I didn't 
qLjhWVtXicf1VFSdoDQeH4afemW2	I hung out with somebody new like a week ago or week and a half ago.  It was an experience, but it didn't end well. 
qLjhWVtXicf1VFSdoDQeH4afemW2	dry dead board fatigue lost alone lonely  unmotivated 
qLjhWVtXicf1VFSdoDQeH4afemW2	Yes, I feel good about it. And I did everything almost everything that I needed to do. 
qLjhWVtXicf1VFSdoDQeH4afemW2	Well, I'm really thankful to finally have my music out and I have a live interview tomorrow for the first time and that's really exciting. So I'm thankful that I'm finally found the following my dreams. 
qLjhWVtXicf1VFSdoDQeH4afemW2	First of all, it's very clear that I'm lonely. Otherwise, I wouldn't be on the app like this talking to a robot and computer just a lot going on in my head and it's just so annoying because I have so many good things going for me. I've been happy for a while things are starting to go down not completely down. The street is being overtaken by boredom chronic fatigue have no friends a cut off my family because I just can't deal with them anymore. They drive me crazy and make me hate myself. I don't even like how I act when I interact with them. And so I have no friends. No close connections. My dumbass slept with the second like black advocate for my son in the school. It was a mistake because he's a dick head in the assholes. It's not necessarily that they can an asshole, but he's something and I do regret it for so many different reasons in the cell. Whatever that's a whole nother situation. Maybe I'll elaborate on that another time, but also not having a car is really annoying but it's hard for me to go to work because I don't have the motivation for work for anybody. I do have a home business that I really need to put some time into and work on and build clientele and learn how to do lighting and start doing some photo shoots at my house so I can get some money and then maybe also learn bartending and do some hair because I need to make some money. Maybe I should get a part-time job now and to get a good enough amount of money to come in. I really want to do something extravagant in the next 6 months. Like I'm supposed to shoot a video for one of my songs, but now I'm thinking maybe I should go somewhere for my son because I don't want to  I just want to miss opportunities to live though. I'm excited to be doing my music. I really want to explore life too, and I don't know.  can I just wish I had like a super best friend may be a boyfriend but  My interactions with men are not good.  God bless myself.  They're not really good and sometimes I think what I'm looking for is not realistic.  And I don't know I'm tired of feeling fatigued like I feel chronic fatigue most of the time and it's driving me crazy. And that is putting a damper on everything. I don't know if this is if it's because of this weather, but I am really sick of Seattle. I really wish that I can leave here, but  I say no because I was going to say is 4J, but now I'm starting to get over that Hawaii will be ideal, but I'll have to do a lot of research and finally maybe to visit to see because honestly, I just can't deal with you anymore. 
qLjhWVtXicf1VFSdoDQeH4afemW2	Girl, I was just talking to my friend about the friend. I complain about yesterday the guy.  and  I blocked him in forgot and so he could have been a possibility that he tried to hit me back and I forgot I doubt it, but I just wanted to share my Insanity. So when I go back to reflect I can remember. 
qLjhWVtXicf1VFSdoDQeH4afemW2	Something or someone that inspires me and why that's the question, isn't it?  I have anyone that inspires me, but something that inspires me every step that I take closer to my dream is inspiring. 
qLjhWVtXicf1VFSdoDQeH4afemW2	Well, I finally got out the house and went some food shopping and eat at the supermarket with my son and so being out made things better came back and did some laundry move some stuff in my room, which was awesome spoke to the people that is going to do my live interview tomorrow, and I don't know just being activated a good day.

qb9RFfo9fVdk7hXLbD4x5z7JOeY2	right now I'm upset because I feel like  I've been wasting my time.  With my friendship with Alyssa. I feel like I'm just so tired of repeating myself. I'm tired of the drama and I feel like I'm so much stronger. I'm so much wiser. And it's like, how can I be friends with someone who isn't even on my level, you know, I'm getting to a point where I just want to be a piece. I want to have a peace of mind and what about the times when I need someone to talk to when I need a shoulder to lean on I can't because I'm always having to be her shoulder her support system, but I can't get that in return.  And then when you deal with somebody who's always making stupid dumb irrational decisions, how can I go talk to you talk to her about any type of ice on my life my love life or just life in general when this person's life is in shambles and I'm starting to feel like now is the time where I need to just come in like a queen myself away from her because I'm just tired. I'm tired of the inconsistencies.  I'm just tired of being somebody's counselor. I don't want to be her counselor. I want to be your friend. I want to build memories. I want to have fun. I don't want to always have to be emotional always crying always happen to try to help somebody else get themselves together when they not even trying to help themselves.  It's so dumb to me. It makes me so angry and then you know, I've tried to be the supportive friend. I try to be there for her and only thing I'm good enough for is for her to  Dumped all her anxiety all her life issues on me, but then when I give advice you don't never listen, so what is the point of me steady note sound like a broken record?  I just I need a new support system. I need friends. I need people live. It had level-headed people in my life people that want something out of life that  I know how to take accountability and not always wanted to have a pity party and want people to feel sorry for them when you not even trying to do anything to help yourself a better yourself just time being wasted.  And it's like I'm tired of letting people waste my time. You won't waste my time. My time means everything to me. My time is valuable and I'm tired of wasting time on people. It's not worth my time.

However  Myself, I do not adhere to the things that I feel like I should which prohibits me from having self-confidence in myself.

Opportunity in there they have to have other people to care for them. So I was really excited about being able to get the opportunity to sorry. I didn't feel my body and build my mind.  And in addition to that to understand what I'm supposed to do to do those things. 
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	I’m calm, but I wonder what does my day look like as I move ahead.  I understand it is not the best practice to worry about the day ahead. 
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	I  want to focus on all of the things that I want.  Me. Davis suggested that I should write a book.  She is also the person who suggested that I go to school.  I know she is just the person sent to confirm things in my life.
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	I do find myself.  Not celebrating my success is because I work in an environment where even when there's something that happens that successful then we'll ridiculed and they're asking for more. 
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	I do feel like I struggle with my successes to celebrate my success has there always seems like there is more to do and perhaps I feel like there's more to do because I didn't plan effectively because I didn't implement the plan if I did.  Playing someone plan. So they're always feels like there is more to do and if I do not adhere to my standards.  Then this will continue to be a challenge. 
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	when choosing an over the past couple of weeks I've been  shining my shoes and  I know their kind of gunky here in there. It's an exciting process to take a look at my hard work and see what I've done and how I'm preserving myself making myself look nice in my shoes. 
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	I love the spring.  The outdoors gives me life.
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	I love my car.  It is nice and comfortable since I have to spend a lot of time in it.
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	I felt tense and angry.  I felt like lashing out at others. I also felt an intense high.  I had a burst of energy.
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	Today, I had a positive attitude.  I am learning my attitude relies on my behavior and what I need to do.  I choose the response.  I will not allow the world to dictate my response.
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	Right now, I am journaling.  This makes me feel good.
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	At times, I am not sure that I love Eva.  Let’s be honest, we are together because of convenience. 
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	I wish I weren’t scared to drive.  I’ve been having panic attacks when driving.  I’ve got to be free.
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	I feel like my money is slipping away on menial bull crap.
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	Today the primary thing is I will.  Get some things done.  Imprimir Thanos reading Aristotle's Poetics.  Because I need that.  for class  So it's imperative that I knocked that out the way.  Today so that I can write my discussion post. 
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	This week I would like to get up when my alarm goes off.  This is what we'll move me toward being where I would like to be. That's the one thing that I can do to remain on schedule for the day. 
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	I want to teach on “b” days without frustration.  
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	How did Marilyn mine?  I definitely had to deal with my children.  and also even if they're my family  so  their ideas and their considerations  are important 
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	There is no deadline for making the decision.  Adjust the requires me to an inmate at the deadline is August of next year. Maybe that's the den. 
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	Also, I wanted to know about my son’s girlfriend.  I’ve never spoken with her nor has my son introduced me to her.
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	I’m grateful for working in a school with my sons.  I can appreciate these moments.
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	When I need to be thinking about my kids in a long-term and how my decisions affect them and what they will be able to do and how they will be able to live. 
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	I feel like answering those questions has been a great help. And even in this brief moment. One of the most difficult things that I have an issue with is.  Articulating my ideas show. This act gives me the opportunity to articulate my ideas and say those things.  And get the ideas out of my head and into the air. I feel like it.  Easy to do so and I look forward to doing this.  in another venue 
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	I want people to remember me as a brilliant mind and resource for helping people be their best selves.  I want them to remember me as a model for excellence.
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	I want to bring real thought to people’s minds and let them know they can be free and control their lives with restraint and discipline.  I want to contribute all things knowledge, health and wellness to the world.
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	Each day, I’m not sure what keeps me going.  I know ai have to keep going for my sons.
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	I think I'm accurate. Of course, there could be some distortions.  And of course those things will probably emerge.  in  later times. I look forward to that.  But as far as today.  goes  I believe that I've made it an appropriate evaluation of  others perception of me 
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	I believe that is possible that my idea was distorted.  Go where my key is not up. 
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	It let me know that if I plan and adhere to my plan, I will accomplish things and tasks.
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	If I felt less doubt.  In my life, I think I would take more chances at more opportunities over the past week or so. I've done those things.  And kind of step forward in.  dove into some activities that I wouldn't have normally done like right now I'm doing the National Honor Society and that  Is a pretty great for me. 
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	At a certain point, I believe it's just me.  I need to learn how to respond to my environment. 
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	I would ride to various cities in Texas.
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	The best case scenario is I get to North Dallas. I try North Dallas app. I hone my craft. I learned my craft I get with other Educators who will help me to do that.  and  become a better teacher.  And then take the road to college. 
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	Feel good about myself. I deserve to feel good about myself. 
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	My body can do some pretty incredible things!
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	Making healthier decisions everyday.  I am making healthier decisions everyday.  I am making healthier decisions everyday. 
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	I want to be a positive example for how to love your body.
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	Pretty good, because I know him.  I know. I'm headed in the right direction. 
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	I'm wondering if I should remain a teacher. I want to be a professor.  And I want to teach somewhere where I don't have to deal with parents or Administration.  but the problem is  it comes down to money. 
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	Today, my time with students does not go without problems, but I see kids starting to try and manage the class. Also, this kid who was reluctant to participate, started to read and I felt good.
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	I’ve completed my morning activities, prayer, meditation, and now my coaching session.
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	I’m approaching the day with a positive attitude and framing the context of my experiences in a no fail, learning type of way.  My goal is to ask how, not why?
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	I decided to take care of myself, through reading the Bible, meditating, and praying even though I woke up late.  I did not let that stop me!
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	I feel like I should do what I am supposed to do.  It takes time, but I feel more satisfied when that time is spent wisely.
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	The first thing I need to do is get organized. I need to find that out line. If I don't have the Baha'i outline that I need to create one from my Note review those notes create an outline from those notes Next Step. I'm going to write I'm going to step forward and I'm going to attack that task. I'm going to do it and take good care of it. 
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	Today, has been interesting.  I’ve managed to be able to regulate my moods and stay focused in difficult situations like the one IM IN NOW.  David ended up at his soccer game with my keys!
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	I have a great work ethic.  I pursue excellence. 
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	I see myself as a person with good intentions.  I see myself with the knowledge and information to move toward those intentions.  I see myself in bracing.  new ways to  achieve  the various goals that I have set for myself. 
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	My inspiration came from me doing my best and committing to doing the work.
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	I’m proud that I have made accomplishments in my life to even be able to be a teacher.
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	Today is my bday. And this is my most difficult day with my students.  The students don't listen they care nothing about education and it's frustrating to be in a room and lack support from your administrative team. 
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	I don't want things that I know that needs to improve in. My life is going to be organization skills and time management.  who sings If I can manage to be the master of my day, I will be able to improve the amount of things that I can put it out and  my prolactin improve my productivity and I'll also be able to improve the quality of my work. 
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	I do that I help my students from your lessons. 
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	I will be sure to be aware in my activities.  If I find that I am drifting off from my activities, I will be sure to using the noting technique to hone in on my current activity.
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	I am aiming for a way to do my best.  I know when I do my best, I don’t have anything else to worry about.
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	I think that all people should be free.  Freedom comes through exiting the world of materialism and navigating a world predicated on self-exploration.
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	Some people aren't able.  To care for themselves because they've been injured.  again  Who do you like?  has  gotten them in a corner.  It's preventing them.  From doing some of the things that perhaps they would like to do. 
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	I want to see if it's a knot.  Any but I think I did put away about $100 maybe 150 the other day and that's something that I want to continue to do. 
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	I think there are some people who might think that.  My mom and sometimes my sons.  I hope not, but I know that a lot of times my focus has been myself.  Realistically, I know this sounds like an excuse, but you can’t help anyone if you haven’t helped yourself.
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	When I change my mindset and determined that I will respond to situations in the way that is best suitable for me, things have been pleasant.
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	What time management skills will be able to improve?  When each day I get up I plan my day and not only will I plan my day, but I will adhere to the plan. 
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	This morning, I was grateful for the time I spent with my oldest son, Donovan.
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	I’m happy because I be been in a good mood.  It feels great and difficult things become doable.
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	Today I'm feeling proud.  That I'm looking at things from a different context and looking at these things from a different context helps me to reframe my thought around what's going on in my life and makes me feel lighter better.  And more intuitive about my responses. 
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	My son offered to buy me some food.
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	Each day when I speak to people.  Today, I stepped forward and made suggestions in a tense meeting.  I tried to be solution oriented.
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	I should be honest about the state of my relationship.
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	I could possibly be passing up a retirement opportunity at a decent retirement, but  You know from my understanding I can contribute to my retirement as long as I work for a, Texas.  College 
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	Tomorrow, looks like being thoughtful in my steps, working with others and speaking politely.
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	I don't think the outsiders understand that professors make less money.  And so, you know my pay as far as money will not be consistent. But you know again, there are people who are professors who are making their money, so I can't necessarily say that. 
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	The song Shaner the main assumption is dead. I'll be broke and I don't want to be broke. I do enjoy having money, but I do understand that take a note professorship would also afford me a different level of freedom. 
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	I would like to say please and thank you.
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	Yes, I definitely think I could do that through.  kitchen college at night 
qioUcmU5EWRGvXaQHE2zeXHQSHU2	I became anxious when I graded the first set of DOL’s.  The score were horrible and I felt like I was a failure.
qjGQq536i5ffnSs0mGNTgsf71u73	When I get back to you on that. 
qjGQq536i5ffnSs0mGNTgsf71u73	Always stand up for myself. 
qjGQq536i5ffnSs0mGNTgsf71u73	Well, I just feel.  black history  definitely  I could definitely use some sleep right now. I'm and very exhausted from work and it's crazy because I have worked. I mean I have slept for about 5 hours.  since yesterday  I'm still pretty tired. I know 5 hours. Is it really a lot anyways, but  Still pretty tired. I don't have much to do today. I had a dentist appointment, but I canceled it and rescheduled it for tomorrow.  work is such a fucked in the ass, but I mean such a pain in the ass honestly like  I just need to find something better something that I'm going. I'm going to love something about why we'll make great money.  and  just a job that makes me want to come to work and I  and I I I only want to come to work because I know that I can come in early and know that I am not going to be bothered by supervisor interview like that. But still it's not worth it when the management is trash.  the co-worker the trash  Dennis just hope it lasts.  Then which me to say I haven't really spoken to her. I kind of left on all red, so  Yeah.  I haven't really.  spoken to her  probably won't speak to her today. I mean unless she texts me but no nose.  I probably won't text her one because I'm going to be asleep in two because I told her I'm trying to give her space and you know when she wants to talk to me, she'll talk to me. I just don't like to feel like I'm putting in too much effort on doing too much even though I know I'm nauseous you clearly don't want to speak to me Tony. Do you know I'll be here hopefully.  Amazon this morning. I say 56 in the morning.  January 7th, I'm sorry, January 8th.  20/20  see how the rest of this year's going to go.  All right. I'm getting some sleep. 
qjGQq536i5ffnSs0mGNTgsf71u73	It was okay, I fell down some stairs and then I made chili for dinner and tried some brownies and also got a few packages today. Me and Jamaicia are alright I guess. I also got more money in my direct deposit than I expected(thank god!) Now I’m at work scout to rest for a little. 
qjGQq536i5ffnSs0mGNTgsf71u73	Yeah, so I went to the Spanish place that my mom recommended in Boston.  Who was all right.  I definitely love the song avocado branch that they have for the avocado fries. It's so good.  But I definitely didn't stick to my diet today. Like I'm supposed to be keto and I have not been keto but it's okay cuz  Honey, is it just start preparing myself? I'm still in the process of figuring out.  everything and  What keto really is but I have a good feeling that at the end of my 14 day challenge.  I will be more knowledgeable about it.  .  With that being said I am preparing for a 40. I'm sorry 14 day challenge.  I'm hoping that this will help me with the weight loss.  And just getting my life together.  I didn't really speak to Jamaica today.  I was pretty much busy all day. And you know, I've asked you if I wasn't really thinking about her that much. I don't know if it's because I was just a little irritated from the night before.  But I forgot to talk about yesterday.  I'm sorry about that, but home, let me give you a little.  nightcap  Okay.  so  Yesterday me and her had plan to hang out. I was going to go over her house and spend the night.  And the beginning of the day she told me she had been to work. She fell asleep at work cuz she had a headache.  And then she told me that when she had got home she's felt she felt really sleepy.  and  do you know I first I was like, okay well.  She probably not going to want to hang out.  So I asked she said you know, it's fine.  But I could tell that she actually didn't want me to hang out with her because she was uncomfortable and wasn't really in the mood.  but you know, I kind of ignored it just because  she was still telling me, you know to come over but I should have just gotten the hint and just stayed home.  I just did not want to be home, but I have to stop being that way.  So I went to her house.  I was literally over there for about an hour not even an hour or maybe just an hour actually and  I don't know it was weird.  I mean it wasn't weird but  You're saying that she wasn't feeling well.  And I'm doing everything that she does what she kind of wants me to go home without actually saying it.  and I  she got mad at me.  4 Hour  she got mad at me because she told me to come here cuz you was laying in the bed and I was getting ready to go and she told me to come here.  And I went up to her and she was literally like asleep to herself.  and  I didn't do anything.  I just sat there and I'm just like, you know, she looks exhausted. So I'm not going to bother her and be all up in her face. Fenton Lake what the hell  that's just like if I'm sleeping and I'm going to be all up in my face like  What the heck?  I don't know.  I'm just being a little irritated like and then  another thing was  I told her that I was going home because she said she wanted me to go home.  And when I called my Uber she started peeing on extra affectionate and what not, you know, and it's like why do you do that when I'm leaving and when you're leaving?  tank  It's annoying. It's like she's teasing me.  Like she should give me a little taste of something like he wasn't acting like that before. So why are you acting like that now that I have to go? You know, I don't really like that.  But yeah, so I resent spend.  We haven't spoken until.  I think she responded.  about 20 minutes ago, maybe  I didn't respond back cuz the conversation isn't going anywhere and I have to go to sleep for work. So  I think my mom's home. So.  If I'm going to go now and I will speak more tomorrow night.  All right.  Good night. 
qjGQq536i5ffnSs0mGNTgsf71u73	it's been awhile, but  The last time would have to be when?  Maybe a month ago. 
qjGQq536i5ffnSs0mGNTgsf71u73	I hope so. I don't get to sleep now. I won't be 
qkeCSOpqsQZRV87aPHdlEt1yeuF2	always pushing myself from my comfort zone
qkeCSOpqsQZRV87aPHdlEt1yeuF2	both my classes got canceled 🥴
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	Yes, through the windows. When he looked away I had to army crawl to the gun in a basket by the door. But when he looked away I realized he was headed around the corner to my front door.
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	I guess we worked together? Or maybe it was originally thought to be at school.
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	I had no where I could go through to get outside without him knowing. I ran to my bedroom.
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	I’m confused by the question...
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	She was obviously not stable yet she was able to tell me she was ok and would respond  with voice and touch
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	We used to be friends in real life, that’s what I was referring to. In the dream we weren’t necessarily friends.
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	They would either be rewarded in some way or taken advantage of. There’s the vague line of trusting people and being naive. And sometimes it’s hard identify one over the other.
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	She did know her name because she responded to it
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	Yes I already have.. the question should be if I don’t always have them
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	Because he had a gun and somehow I knew he wanted to kill me.
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	"That question literally gave me shivers.

I still love her. She basically said she was over our friendship when at that moment I had pushed her to see me because I felt it was important to talk about whatever was wrong. I wanted to fix our friendship. And she had already given up on it without a peep. Without even trying. And that hurts deep. I mean 10 years of friendship and it’s not even worth a conversion? I’m worried about her. Everything she said I didn’t do, I actually had done at one point or another within a year of our conversation. I went into that talk thinking I would be open and accept whatever wrongs I had and work on what she needed me to work on. But then she said those things and I thought, “I guess it just wasn’t enough. She needed more and I didn’t give that to her.” But once I got out of the shock form our conversation, I asked myself why? She never communicated that that’s what she needed or wanted from me/us (aka Katie and me). So how could I know this? A few times she told me that I “should have known.” But how the fuck do I think of something when you’re 200+ miles away, I see you once every 1-2 months, and you don’t ask me so much as “hi, how are you?” ????  She said it everything wasn’t a convenience to her, yet she never said that to me before. She said I would come into town for family events and never just to see her, yet she never asked. As if I’m expected to drive 200+ miles to the same town my family lives in without spending time with them. 

These were just some of the hits.

I’m still expected to do so much, yet receive nothing in return. And that’s draining. She basically said she’s moved on at the exact moment I was trying to talk to her in person to figure out why our friendship seemed so distant, to try to mend anything. She was already gone."
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	Stop asking me about the universe moving. It doesn’t.
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	I don’t know but obviously a very long time if I ended up going from 15 minutes behind to an hour and a half. I just don’t know how long we were “gone” before we were trying to find parking
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	I believe 10 or more years. Best friends.
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	Uh what? His wife needed for him to get a job.
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	Running into someone I know at an upcoming event
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	From my knowledge the universe doesn’t move... also is this the only one or are there multiple universes?
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	I don’t know if enjoy is the right term. It helps me prepare for conversations or actions I may have in the near future
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	I don’t remember any. When I woke up from the dream, I had the urge to sing ‘Nobody’s Perfect.’ It was stuck in my head.
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	I could feel the bird biting my arm
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	I could only feel the gun when I was loading it.
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	There were some strangers but most of my attention was on people who used to be my friends. I remember Jordan was in it a lot. Along with Culan, Tommy, and Kat.
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	I was home alone. I looked out the window and saw military men in position, hiding. I couldn’t tell if they were just on look out or activity searching for someone. There was also a man, broad build with dark hair and mustache, who was searching around outside my place.
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	I was with my dad for part of it. It flipped to a boy and girl I didn’t recognize. Another part had Jamie Gordon with her kids and more kids that I didn’t recognize. Another part I was holding onto her youngest and I was sitting with the other kids.
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	I considered staying at my parents for an extra 2 days so I could see more family members. I thought about new things I wanted to say to my friend Kat.
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	Joy said I should go to California and Ireland and tell Michaela I can’t do Bahamas too. She said that’s too much and I already have a big trip planned. I agree, I just don’t want to disappoint Mac.
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	That I would resource at work for a little to help them. I need a better organizational system for my mail/papers. I thought about Brent again because I ran into him at work.
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	I woke up with my body in a calm state (that doesn’t happen often with bad dreams), but I felt very alarmed and still had the sense that I should be scared, as I did at the end of the dream. I was a little warm when I woke up but I was also wrapped tight in my comforter and extra blankets.
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	Not having to go back to work tonight
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	"It started with me walking to Lawrence, KS. Idk why or exactly where I had to go. I remember being at a “hospital” and I was working on the rehab. It was a boring night (and I thought I should tell Katie that this is actually boring compared to AnaLiza saying PCU is boring). No one was doing much, just on their phones or computers. I went to the POU room and in comes a girl my age with one or two kids, I can’t remember. I leave the room and soon find out she’s looking for a specific room, which turned out to be a room that’s like a playground for kids.
The next thing I remember is walking back to my home. It’s several hundred miles so I go from walking, to riding a bike, to driving one of our old family vans. When I was on the bike, I could easily pass through cars, so in the van my mindset was the same. I would be driving on the other side or in the grass medium (when on the highway) just to pass them. I drove through a “small town.” Then on the highway I was going past some cars, then there seemed to be a huge stretch of cars. Turns out there’s an accident at the end of the cars, but I slowed down and pretended like I had been in line the whole time when driving past the wreck. There was a police car, fire truck, and a flat semi with a crushed car on top.
Next thing I knew, I was walking up to my house. I don’t actually recognize this house. When I go in, it’s dark and quiet. But then I walk down the hallway and to the left I see 3 people (kind of in individual chairs) who look like they’re asleep. I don’t remember recognizing the person on bottom. The person in middle is a teacher from RK (don’t remember her name). The person closest is Grace (from work). I noticed Grace’s legs were positioned crossed over each other and I thought that was strange. Then I had a gut feeling they weren’t asleep. I go to the kitchen and grab a large knife that was in the sink, just under a white cutting board. I think to myself, what if someone used this knife in this home? I go around the corner and turn on a light while calling 911. Then I heard the squeak of a door. I go back to the bathroom (I know, dumb) and find the RK teacher awake and confused. Then I wake up."
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	"My dad and I were floating in the middle of the lake Innsbrook, next to a jet ski. The scene changes where I’m seeing a teenage boy and girl in the water I’m front of their jet ski. It was pictured like a horror movie. The jet ski “came to life” and ran down the boy and girl. Then my position took the girl’s spot and I could see the boy floating down into the water because he was killed.
It flips back to the scene with my dad and me. We say we are thankful to have something attached to the jet ski that isn’t motorized and if ours were to do something like that we would be saved if we got onto that part. That’s all I rennet from that scene.
The next I know, I see Jamie Gordon with her kids and other kids whom I didn’t recognize. They are sitting in the inlet playing an easy card game. The scene changes where I’m sitting in her spot and she is moving across the lake, watching us play the game. I wasn’t doing well in the game. The kid to the left of me won and Sam (who was on my right) told me he knew I wouldn’t win because he had been paying close attention to what I was doing. Then there was a feeling that some time had lapsed and a large bird flys onto a branch right next to me. It was a pretty bird with lots of colors... until it looked at me. The other kids slid into the water. I held Sam under my arms in the lap to protect him and raised my right arm over my head. The bird looked away, then back again. It went for my arm. I tried to wave my arm in case that would scare him away. Then I woke up."
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	"I saw the man with a gun outside. I army crawled to get my gun by the door. I got it and ran to my bedroom. By the time I loaded the gun he was almost to the bedroom door. Then I woke up.
There was more to the dream before all of this but I can’t remember."
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	We ordered our food. It was a huge line. We kept crawling up then went past just a little because everyone kept moving forward. Then we realized they must have gotten their food because we ended up at the light to leave without anything. We went inside and waited 20 minutes until someone noticed and helped us. We got our food plus the 2 extra orders other people had missed. The extras orders ended up being sets of male child’s and toddler’s dinosaur pj’s. This wasn’t useful because we didn’t even know any boys that age who would fit them.
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	"I remember trying to talk to people but mostly everyone seemed to already be involved in a conversation. It didn’t bother me though. I thought maybe then I would start the work project to get an early start then I could chat later. I was walking around doing something or looking for someone, I can’t remember. Then I went back to start my project. We needed 3 of these things that were made of balloons. It was some clump of small to tiny balloons already put together. Then Miley Cyrus’s ‘Nobody’s Perfect’ came on. I got excited, was singing and dancing. And at the start of a refrain I belted it out and pointed straight then realized Kat was in that direction, looking at me, dancing. Then she started moving closer, still dancing. She appeared happy, like nothing was wrong with our friendship. And in my mind I wondered if she thought our friendship was still the same? Was she, again, ignoring the fact that something was wrong but put on a happy face and pretended like everything was fine?
I don’t remember anything else from the dream."
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	All of them, even the distant relatives. They have loved and supported me my entire life, and I know that I will always be able to rely on them.
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	All of my opportunities to travel
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	My phone. It has everything at my fingertips. Communication, music, entertainment, news, research, planning, organization.
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	On my drive back a really good song came on and made so happy that I was jamming out to it by myself.
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	I was watching Homicide Hunter with Joe Kenda recently and I think it may have stemmed from the show.
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	I have absolutely no clue. I fell asleep hungry?
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	Possibly that I’ve become content with not being friends in real life with those people, but I’m still struggling with Kat. Maybe even that it’s ok to become content with her as well? Maybe. That’s not what I want, though.
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	The world would be way too crowded for me... I would happy to keep those I love in my life, but there’s still suffering, and I don’t want them to suffer.
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	That would be an ideal world. I believe life would be much happier and less stressful. You could trust and depend on anyone. I believe there wouldn’t be so much suffering and tragedy.
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	Don’t get me started on this one.. our galaxy would be completely different. And would there actually be the end of the planet or you just pull yourself around to the other side? Is there the other side? That’s a deep flat planet... how does the earth move through space?
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	That would be boring. I love how unique everyone is
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	Usually they’re related to stress. I just worked 3 nights in a row and work is very stressful for me. The dream also involved me being at work at the beginning. Yesterday Katie said that AnaLiza stayed the PCU was boring.
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	I overslept and didn’t get any of errands completed and didn’t get a gift I need.
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	I didn’t do much. Just overslept, packed, and drove to Kansas City.
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	"Sleep. Get my luggage. Grocery shopping. Finish my laundry. Get final Christmas and birthday gifts.
GET THESE FUCKING SQUIRRELS OUT OF MY CEILING."
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	It didn’t feel like I got a lot done. I looked at gifts but didn’t actually get one. I put away the dishes. I picked up some hours at work. I started the laundry. I took a shower.
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	Well I’ve only been at work.. and I actually had lunch so that’s a big accomplishment for my job.
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	I made it back home, unpacked, put together my new bed frame, organized my paperwork. I do feel successful with the limited time I had to accomplish these things.
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	My bed. My roommate. My moon lamp. Candles. Blankets. Phone. Eye mask. Art. Everything.
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	Not much. I’m just winding down after just getting home from picking up extra hours at work.
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	Traveling, having a relaxing night in with someone or people I enjoy spending time with, walks at the park, casual sport activities, concerts, visiting with people I haven’t seen in a while.
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	I worked - floated to 5N and only had 4 patients until 6am. Clocked out at 0715 and got home at 0740. I cleaned myself up and now I’m in bed ready for good sleep
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	It was confusing because the events didn’t relate much. I felt sad, but not too sad, that the teens had been killed by the living jet ski. I was happy to see Jamie and the kids. I was excited playing the game. I was very scared when the bird arrived, and protective of the kids.
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	There weren’t a lot of emotions. I was a little anxious that we missed our food and had to go back. Then I was frustrated and sad when waiting for the new food.
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	"I felt content at the beginning, even though I was around people who used to be my friends and I imagine I would be stressed around them in real life.
I was slightly stressed about the fact that I had work to complete.
Then excited when there was music and dancing. But almost immediately when I saw Kat, I was anxious, confused, upset, sad."
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	Very scary. I had a lot of anxiety.
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	I believe I was at “work” but it wasn’t actually my workplace. I’m struggling to remember details but I don’t think this building is familiar.
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	We were at a lake. I think it was supposed to be Innsbrook. The land was made up of islands. We were in the water, either by the boats or in the “inlet”. The inlet was a small body of shallow water that you could sit in. And only a small portion of it was open to the large body of lake.
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	At my home, but it wasn’t my real home.. looked like a 2 bedroom ranch.
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	I was going through the drive thru at a chick-fil-a with my dad
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	Not at the moment. I’m scared. Mostly because I don’t know what my future holds or the direction I want it to go. I’m excited about the idea of big parts of my future. But the closest future is an unknown one and it’s terrifying.
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	No. I don’t have patience for stupidity. Obviously my sarcasm gets in the way. I think I try really hard, then something stupid or that I would regret comes out of my mouth.
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	The trips and concerts I already have planned in the next year.
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	At the end of the dream, I could the knife that I picked up
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	More than I possibly am capable of. But mostly kindness, love, patience, sense of belonging
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	My family and friends. Self motivation talks
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	"First dream: airplane. Man and other people. Candy. Las Vegas strip bit rennovated. Woman landing airplane. New runway. Eiffel Tower.

Second dream: pulling up “flooring” or top layer at parents house (dining room and Matt’s old room. Holes in floor. Happy New signs on wall. Mom, dad, Matt, Rachel. Sam in den. Luke at wedding with Mandy. Max and Hannah have wedding and son’s baptism at same time. Manchester. White building."
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	Volunteer; take interior design courses and shadow designers; travel
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	Oh man, that's a tough one cuz this year has been absolutely incredible. 
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	Catching up on the tv show. I just got to relax and have a few laughs.
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	The Chief’s rally was an incredible once in a lifetime celebration (hopefully not actually once in a lifetime.) They accomplished a historic win and celebration. It made me feel inspired, hopeful, full of pride and joy. I love being a part of Kansas City
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	I overslept... again. Then I attempted to look for late Christmas gifts. I took a shower. I made food and watched a few episode of Parks and Recreation. Then I called work to pick up some extra hours resourcing. I barely ran into Brent.. I’m sure he was relieved I was on my way out the door. Then I came home and started laundry.
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	Today I woke up a little early (by my standards) to get ready for the Chiefs’s Super Bowl victory parade!!! I went with Katie Bialczak and Stephanee Davidson. We walked to union station for the rally. There were so many people and it was a lot of fun. Just freezing cold. Then I went home, ate, then heading to Jamie and Alex’s to watch the kiddos. Played Legos with the boys. 
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	The entire night I was asleep. However, I know I woke up in the middle of the night (it didn’t seem to far from when I woke up form the dream), so I know it wasn’t that long.
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	It’s the first time since 1969
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	All of my knowledge. I was lucky enough to get a really good education. I’m thankful I’m knowledgeable to have a sustainable job as being a nurse.
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	I had a nice laugh with an ER NP
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	I took a shower... and I drank some water...
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	The whole day made me smile!
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	Catching up on the tv show
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	"Convince myself to take care of errands or go to the grocery store in the morning before I have to sleep again for work.
Talk myself, again, into telling my boss I can pick up an entire shift. And try not to go into it with such a terrible attitude."
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	Leslie Knope.. aka Amy Poehler. She is so talented and funny. She made my day brighter.
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	Tonight when I made myself go in to work to help out. It wasn’t so much my comfort zone, but it was definitely something I didn’t want to do.
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	No I wish I could push myself more to step out of my comfort zone. I feel like I’ve become lazier as I’ve gotten older. I used to give 100% at everything, and now it feels like 70-80%
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	Put your boundaries, even just a little. Usually it’s worth it.
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	"I can’t remember much now so this might be fragmented.

KC Children’s Mercy hospital. Mary Dreifke wants to Venmo me because of our complications trying to get this girl to surgery. I say no thank you, look at my watch, were 1.5 hrs late to surgery. 

trying to take a child to surgery but we somehow end up with an Uber driver. He takes us somewhere then we head back to the hospital. He tries to get a parking spot on the top level (there’s 3 levels) but he can’t find one right at the entrance so he decided to leave. I tell him no just drop us off at the door. We were already 15 minutes late. He tried to turn around but goes out the entrance and gets confused in the “Plaza” streets. He ends up at the bottom entrance (even further from where we originally left from). I reluctantly go in and try to get this girl back upstairs in a wheelchair. I tried calling the number provided to contact her parents but it doesn’t ring. I realize that the hospital has probably called a Code Pink by this time but no one would suspect a new patient coming in to be the kid missing. I call security to help me get her to surgery because they would be looking for her."
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	"This may also be scattered

I was at work and we had so many patients that one of mine was moved to the storage unit on my floor. I hadn’t seen the patient yet but was told by my tech that her heart rate was in the 200’s. I look at a little of her info because I didn’t get report then try figuring out who the doc is. I finally figure out who to call, I tell my charge, Johns. She seems concerned but walks away. I call the person on call, but I can’t think of anything except ask if they want me to call a met team. She says yes. After the second attempt to call I get to the operator and she announces it. During that time I yelled to my charge and told her we were met teaming my patient. I told another nurse to get a crash cart while I get the dynomap. She just gets a manual BP machine. I find things to keep the door open because it won’t stay open on it’s on. I also cleared the room of all the crap surrounding the patient. My patient is Danielle James. When I first see her, her arms are shacking and she has a blank stare, similar to seizure like symptoms. I need to get her on her side but she’s surrounded by so much shit in the storage room. I say name and she ‘wakes up’, saying she’s with it and she’s ok.
While I’m propping the door and rolling everything out the door, I got the dynomap. I came back and Danielle was on the floor (about 5 ft away) from the bed and her pole on the ground. I realize the bed isn’t completely locked. I dint know how she fell ended up on the floor. I pick her up onto the bed, asking the other nurse Jessica, to help pick up her lines/tubes/bags of blood.  She had at least 1 drain, Foley, rectal tube looking thing connected to the Foley, and 2 bags of blood infusing. I had no clue why or what was going on. 

Jessica isn’t helping and only telling me the line is going to bend as I’m putting Danielle back on the cart. I pick everything up. I hook up the manual BP and start to hook up the dynomap. Then RT comes in looking annoyed asking, “Who’s going to talk to me?” Then she starts reading a paper saying she’s here with diverticulitis, already had the antibiotic, so why do I need a met team? I tell her about her heart rate.

Then I woke up"
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	No I wish I hadn’t slept in so late. It was an accident but I still wish it didn’t happen. I also regret not actually finding the gift I was looking for or going out to take care of errands.
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	A job that I am happy and excited to go to with people who care about me and want me to excel.
qncGqFgVsjel9iuT4yR7ciXW3vo2	Possibly distant. I haven’t seen a lot of people recently
qoUGnXx3gEd6vUfAcvchbuwkqfG3	It’s not my parents relationship the problem, is with my husband, my possible boyfriend and the other guy and the other new ones
qoUGnXx3gEd6vUfAcvchbuwkqfG3	I’ve been in a hard time trying to figure out what I want for my life in relationship

qoUGnXx3gEd6vUfAcvchbuwkqfG3	I’m not feeling attached to my partner anymore

qoUGnXx3gEd6vUfAcvchbuwkqfG3	Have my own success business 
qov4OLbBhYOw0NFtmjxph6k95Vj2	When I’m comfortable with someone I will open up and show the real me
qov4OLbBhYOw0NFtmjxph6k95Vj2	Try not to put myself down when people think I’m doing well
qov4OLbBhYOw0NFtmjxph6k95Vj2	I think I'm a kind.  maybe too kind  friend that always listens even when I should be probably asking for the help. 
qov4OLbBhYOw0NFtmjxph6k95Vj2	I’m a bit shy at first but tend to open up after feeling comfortable with someone
qov4OLbBhYOw0NFtmjxph6k95Vj2	Too kind, quiet and innocent
qov4OLbBhYOw0NFtmjxph6k95Vj2	I helped take a person to his needs to go. 
qov4OLbBhYOw0NFtmjxph6k95Vj2	I want to be a nurse and I like video games!
qov4OLbBhYOw0NFtmjxph6k95Vj2	I want to be able to not think bad about myself this week
qov4OLbBhYOw0NFtmjxph6k95Vj2	Nothing really special so far, but I don’t have school tomorrow!
qov4OLbBhYOw0NFtmjxph6k95Vj2	The one question made it feel kind of hard. I found it to be kind of hard to answer just cuz  I don't really normally think about that kind of stuff. 
qov4OLbBhYOw0NFtmjxph6k95Vj2	I do think it would change.  my actions and emotions 
qov4OLbBhYOw0NFtmjxph6k95Vj2	Kind and caring, naturally a happy person overall
qov4OLbBhYOw0NFtmjxph6k95Vj2	Getting some work done in class today 
qov4OLbBhYOw0NFtmjxph6k95Vj2	Maybe I’m using people to my advantage but I don’t mean to
qov4OLbBhYOw0NFtmjxph6k95Vj2	I'm not sure but you can't really judge a book by it's cover. So.  I guess it all depends on.  How they act and what their actions are. 
qpwtqv6LoNNrfuTuIyTnA3Amm3w1	No, but as a whole I felt like I was in a better state of mind today that I have been. 
qpwtqv6LoNNrfuTuIyTnA3Amm3w1	Putting my will you be a bridesmaid box onto my memory Shelf? 
qpwtqv6LoNNrfuTuIyTnA3Amm3w1	I got everything done. I needed to get done. So yes. 
qpwtqv6LoNNrfuTuIyTnA3Amm3w1	I went to the post office to mail Christmas stuff to my Nana and Papa.  I came home for a little bit.  I went to the dentist office.  Got numbed up.  That's my feeling and I went home.  My daddy yelled at me.  Even though nothing was my fault.  Cuz the dog was being a butthole and she messed up even though I took them out an hour before I left.  And then we had pizza for dinner.  And I started watching Happy Feet and I fell asleep.  And so I came upstairs and I can't fall back asleep.  I did full face makeup look really good and I took it off. 
qtbeolnDdiXbZukCPDnUbwtGCWR2	Hello, Remy, how you doing? I'm just bored about decision. I made in my past that still bothers me to this day.  How can you help? 
qtiLNM9IHefmeUthdrYlL7EmHGz2	What was that question mean?  Who do you think is being watched more?  I understand the question.  What does it mean?  Who do you think is being watched more?  Who do you think is being washed?  I don't know what that means. 
qtiLNM9IHefmeUthdrYlL7EmHGz2	Yes, I don't know what that means. But yes. 
qtiLNM9IHefmeUthdrYlL7EmHGz2	I suppose the only question left that I have for you is how did you discover in words?  I just went to the App Store and was looking for a journaling app. 
qtiLNM9IHefmeUthdrYlL7EmHGz2	I don't know. I don't know that I experienced any new thoughts per say I think.  Oh, no, I'm just going to Lake Nona Landing new things as far as these.  Videos of concern but I don't really think of them.  Don't know.  I do think that my potential for for how well I can do in these videos something. Maybe I wasn't.  Looking into quite as much before and you know, maybe you're not watching a lot more these videos. I can kind of get good at it the same way I do with producing so I know that's exciting but  other than that, I just going to talk to her say 
qtiLNM9IHefmeUthdrYlL7EmHGz2	Yeah, so I don't know I guess.  I feel  insecure about my relationships, but not even my relationship or save more so just  Oh, no, keeping them the longevity of them. We're not finding ones that are important to me and then  keeping them Portland's why I guess  And I don't have to struggle with.  My confidence I guess like I know I'm the shit.  and  I feel at times. I feel like I am but  I guess I'm looking for some our confirmation. Then the Rolex remind you that you're not that. I guess.  I don't know.  Yeah, I just don't want to feel trash about anymore.  I'm just  I feel like I'm with you. I'm not going to feel trash about it is by having somebody I care about confirm me and  , like that's not dope.  They are. 
qtiLNM9IHefmeUthdrYlL7EmHGz2	Oh, wait, does it continue from the okay hand wash clothes and whatnot for work, but nothing else.  Oregon videos and sleep  and you went to work and I was really just angrily make my money which kind of hurt my feelings but  At this point, you know, I'm still trying to learn new things. But today sold so far good day overall. 
qtm0ZZSB5OUEyW2xsw5fwWgI2bY2	Yes if I don’t end up happy or the mistake I have made now in life or could make sooner on in life 
qtm0ZZSB5OUEyW2xsw5fwWgI2bY2	To try in life and don’t give up
qtm0ZZSB5OUEyW2xsw5fwWgI2bY2	My future and how one day I will be able to live a better life 
qtm0ZZSB5OUEyW2xsw5fwWgI2bY2	To little because I’m a shy person and never know how to start a conversation with others. I also worry about everything I do so that affects a lot in my life 
qtm0ZZSB5OUEyW2xsw5fwWgI2bY2	No I wish my emotions matched how I act around others 
qvRsN4NHi1R4BRaIXtLlJQMMjqq2	I’ll still be thinking about it 
qvRsN4NHi1R4BRaIXtLlJQMMjqq2	Because I love talking to my girlfriend 
qvRsN4NHi1R4BRaIXtLlJQMMjqq2	To not talk to someone all day everyday 
qvRsN4NHi1R4BRaIXtLlJQMMjqq2	I was sad and didn’t know what to do, I thought it was really dumb 
qvRsN4NHi1R4BRaIXtLlJQMMjqq2	My girlfriends mom doesn’t want me to talk to her that much and I feel like I’m a distraction to my girlfriend 
qywEQR5rK3NxVjzpYdC529BdDmD3	I worry that my depression is going to keep me from doing things I'm supposed to do whenever I'm alone or it's quiet or I can't focus on what's going on. I especially worry when I get home but I also just get depressed when I get home and nothing seems worth it 
qywEQR5rK3NxVjzpYdC529BdDmD3	They can be kind and honest and not force themselves to fake emotion. 
qywEQR5rK3NxVjzpYdC529BdDmD3	I've been feeling depressed all day and I feel like I’m bumming my friends out because of it. I couldn't think of anything good to say during our conversations and I felt like a burden they would rather not have. I also feel bad for not feeling anything when they gave me hugs and said it’s going to be ok
qywEQR5rK3NxVjzpYdC529BdDmD3	I have depression and anxiety 
qywEQR5rK3NxVjzpYdC529BdDmD3	Art, friends, self-confidence, mental health, and deep connection with others 
qywEQR5rK3NxVjzpYdC529BdDmD3	My name is Owen Hess, I’m 16, I live in Oak Park with my mom, dad, and sister. I like to watch movies and tv and my favorite show is Avatar the Last Airbender. I have a brother who I love and two dogs and cats. My main hobby is making music. I am a junior in high school 
qywEQR5rK3NxVjzpYdC529BdDmD3	It’s just going. I still don’t feel a drive or any desire to improve my life 
qywEQR5rK3NxVjzpYdC529BdDmD3	My story is beautiful; every part of it 
qywEQR5rK3NxVjzpYdC529BdDmD3	I am committed to always respecting myself 
qywEQR5rK3NxVjzpYdC529BdDmD3	I’m excited for my first day of therapy 
qywEQR5rK3NxVjzpYdC529BdDmD3	Getting on discord with the boys 
qywEQR5rK3NxVjzpYdC529BdDmD3	Sound production listening to the beats 
qywEQR5rK3NxVjzpYdC529BdDmD3	I'm always reassuring and never cause drama. I have goofy ideas, I make music that makes people happy, I'm very open about my mental and emotional health and inspire friends to do the same, and I'm passionate about expressing myself through music/art  
qywEQR5rK3NxVjzpYdC529BdDmD3	My friends and how they’re always there for me. Also how supportive and caring my mom is, even when work is stressful. My dad coming to talk to me just to see how I’m doing because he cares about me. My cute animals regardless of how annoying and smelly they are. My musical talent 
qywEQR5rK3NxVjzpYdC529BdDmD3	I'm concerned because I have nothing to look forward to because depression takes the enjoyment out of everything. I'm worried that it's going to cause me to smoke weed because that guarantees happiness and no negative feelings. And I know I'll be able to fall asleep perfectly and be 100% comfortable. I also know that if I keep doing it every day my depression will only get worse and so will my reliance on substances. 
qywEQR5rK3NxVjzpYdC529BdDmD3	No, I am good at lying to myself about avoiding responsibilities 
qywEQR5rK3NxVjzpYdC529BdDmD3	No, I could definitely be nicer. I’m very socially anxious so I usually say and do things based off if other people will be happy 
qywEQR5rK3NxVjzpYdC529BdDmD3	I have to get evaluated for mental health at compass, do my homework, get gas and bring car home, meditate, read three books, brain training, exercise, make music, watch tv
qywEQR5rK3NxVjzpYdC529BdDmD3	I have to go to work, do my homework, exercise, meditate for 10 minutes, daily brain training, read a book, get on discord with the boys, play startew valley with Henry at 9
qywEQR5rK3NxVjzpYdC529BdDmD3	Finish my physics and English homework at lunch, go to therapy, do homework, exercise, meditate, lumosity, headway, play Stardew valley with mark, make music 
qywEQR5rK3NxVjzpYdC529BdDmD3	It was easy because I'm very aware of my negative traits 
qywEQR5rK3NxVjzpYdC529BdDmD3	My intelligence and focus, socially, and self loathing 
qywEQR5rK3NxVjzpYdC529BdDmD3	Majority of my day with friends because I don't like feeling alone. At home I am usually with my mom because she worries about me and listens to me vent about depression. I spend a lot of my time at home by myself because my social battery runs out fast 
qywEQR5rK3NxVjzpYdC529BdDmD3	Making music. I love hearing a best come together. It's so satisfying 
qywEQR5rK3NxVjzpYdC529BdDmD3	Yes, I would hopefully be more confident 
qywEQR5rK3NxVjzpYdC529BdDmD3	Go to therapy, finish homework, meditate, read three books, brain training, exercise, watch bobs burgers with mom, make music, and go to bed without smoking 
qywEQR5rK3NxVjzpYdC529BdDmD3	I'm late for almost all my responsibilities, I constantly procrastinate, I never know what I'm doing, I never ask myself how I feel, I mess up simple tasks, and I isolate myself 
qywEQR5rK3NxVjzpYdC529BdDmD3	Yes, I see myself in him in a lot of ways with his lack of ability to express himself talking and his passion for doing it through music. He also has such a similar style that there has to be some connection there 
qywEQR5rK3NxVjzpYdC529BdDmD3	Avoid all social situations and let my depression take hold of me
qywEQR5rK3NxVjzpYdC529BdDmD3	He likes to talk to me about how I’m doing and tell stories from work. He loves giving advice 
qywEQR5rK3NxVjzpYdC529BdDmD3	I have friends who will stick with me through any emotional distress 
qywEQR5rK3NxVjzpYdC529BdDmD3	I feel annoyed and sad I don’t do much more but I want to stay positive with myself
qzZt6hRdCIOEnAQcRTC0yZSyJHo2	Try to breathe meteorite try to understand why I'm feeling this way. 
qzZt6hRdCIOEnAQcRTC0yZSyJHo2	I can understand where she's coming from.

qzZt6hRdCIOEnAQcRTC0yZSyJHo2	I just feel a little weird.  Numbers but people I don't really know my future holds. I'm very thankful to be home, but I just feel a little off. 
qzZt6hRdCIOEnAQcRTC0yZSyJHo2	maybe somewhere in New York City San Francisco or  in Great Britain 
qzZt6hRdCIOEnAQcRTC0yZSyJHo2	It hasn't come to an end yet. 
qzZt6hRdCIOEnAQcRTC0yZSyJHo2	definitely gruet overtime

r0KnEmFwydRt10ePgsswi6S7w1J2	It's kind of weird. I'm still getting used to it because it's my space, but it's not my space. But I really enjoy always having my car around. 
r0KnEmFwydRt10ePgsswi6S7w1J2	Yes, that would be my only face wash. 
r0KnEmFwydRt10ePgsswi6S7w1J2	Because it makes things convenient and makes me self-sufficient. 
r0KnEmFwydRt10ePgsswi6S7w1J2	They probably don’t like new people 
r0KnEmFwydRt10ePgsswi6S7w1J2	I'm thankful that I've been more positive and making progress towards my ideal lifestyle 
r0KnEmFwydRt10ePgsswi6S7w1J2	I really like.  Using my fountain pen and my stylist and I want to go and start.  Making sure that I use.  The best things for me to go and stay on what I want to be doing with my day and my life like using raw honey as face wash. 
r0KnEmFwydRt10ePgsswi6S7w1J2	The things you really need will always find their way to you when you truly need them 
r0KnEmFwydRt10ePgsswi6S7w1J2	I'm kinda awkward and shy around new people, but once I get comfortable with someone I care about them deeply and fiercely 
r0KnEmFwydRt10ePgsswi6S7w1J2	I want to be more mindful and productive with my time. I want to feel like i'm living a life that i want 
r0KnEmFwydRt10ePgsswi6S7w1J2	That the house might be in order by the end of the day
r0KnEmFwydRt10ePgsswi6S7w1J2	Hopefully getting things cleaned up here in the apartment and feeling like I have a fresh start. 
r0KnEmFwydRt10ePgsswi6S7w1J2	Being with Michael, my wonderful husband 
r0KnEmFwydRt10ePgsswi6S7w1J2	I found my bookmark from Lola and it really helped me 
r0KnEmFwydRt10ePgsswi6S7w1J2	I got a new water bottle that i've been wanting 
r0KnEmFwydRt10ePgsswi6S7w1J2	I feel stuck, I want to improve and get my life together but I don’t know how 
r0KnEmFwydRt10ePgsswi6S7w1J2	I was able to clean up more in the apartment and get everything kind of set to start really get into my routines. I feel like I was successful in reaching today's goals. 
r0KnEmFwydRt10ePgsswi6S7w1J2	That I'm always trying to improve 
r0KnEmFwydRt10ePgsswi6S7w1J2	That my husband let’s me sleep in as long as I need
r0KnEmFwydRt10ePgsswi6S7w1J2	I feel thankful to take part in playing Dungeons and Dragons with my friends and family. It's a great way to relieve stress as well as see them and socialize and just kinda step out of my own mind for a little bit. 
r0KnEmFwydRt10ePgsswi6S7w1J2	I tend to start strong, but have trouble maintaining my momentum 
r0KnEmFwydRt10ePgsswi6S7w1J2	I finished cleaning my room and wrote some letters 
r0KnEmFwydRt10ePgsswi6S7w1J2	I need to do the dishes, change the calendar, and clean out the mailbox 
r0KnEmFwydRt10ePgsswi6S7w1J2	I have to go by the bank, maybe ups, im trying to get my house in order, and maybe call and see if Michael can join me for my parenting meeting 
r0KnEmFwydRt10ePgsswi6S7w1J2	I'm just trying to get some organization and self reflection done today.
r0KnEmFwydRt10ePgsswi6S7w1J2	I went out with my husband, got a new water bottle, and started trying mindfulness apps
r0KnEmFwydRt10ePgsswi6S7w1J2	Getting my space more together 
r0KnEmFwydRt10ePgsswi6S7w1J2	I'm thankful for  the fact that I still  I have a study is a place to live that we're still here in our own space.  It's nice to have a place where we can do what we want and need to do. 
r0KnEmFwydRt10ePgsswi6S7w1J2	I have to cancel State Farm and get the money order for the rent. 
r0KnEmFwydRt10ePgsswi6S7w1J2	So your parents will never determine my self-worth. 
r0KnEmFwydRt10ePgsswi6S7w1J2	I don't want to relocate. 
r0KnEmFwydRt10ePgsswi6S7w1J2	the best part of my day was  probably  this morning having breakfast with my husband. 
r2Vx220awJeooPjvyxpjKNgmtLy2	I am 35, I am a mom to a 10 year old daughter. I have a bachelors degree in apparel Design / Fashion Design. I want to eat healthier and workout more. And take my dog on walks more.

r53xiWymRKW7QbfUgeG2JUPb45E2	It wouldn't be the end of the world. 
r53xiWymRKW7QbfUgeG2JUPb45E2	If there were no way to tell whether or not that was true, probably the best thing would be just to act normally. 
r53xiWymRKW7QbfUgeG2JUPb45E2	If you acting normally.  It wouldn't.  Draw attention to whoever was running the simulation. 
rDDXKqPiQTdGhAYOO1ZG9Laurzy2	Mostly because I didn't want drama because I didn't want to stop in front of her, you know might just be for the best but I don't know I can't I feel alone when I don't have like a best best friend around, you know. 
rDDXKqPiQTdGhAYOO1ZG9Laurzy2	She hasn't been on the show that I'm out. 
rDDXKqPiQTdGhAYOO1ZG9Laurzy2	I don't even know that's weird. 
rDDXKqPiQTdGhAYOO1ZG9Laurzy2	I honestly don't know. Baby has something to do with the sign.  I like him. Jkjk online funny. 
rDDXKqPiQTdGhAYOO1ZG9Laurzy2	on the App Store on the App Store 
rDDXKqPiQTdGhAYOO1ZG9Laurzy2	No, I think I did the right thing. I think I should have gone harder, but it's okay. 
rDDXKqPiQTdGhAYOO1ZG9Laurzy2	I think a memory.  would probably  going to the movies. I don't know. Actually, I think I think a movie or a movie of memory from today was in the middle of the night when my sister rolled off the bed and like my dad kinda he wasn't like a weird like living shed thing.  In the bed is on top like on the Loft under stairs underneath it on the side and my sister is sleeping on the very end of the bed with my dad up there. Also. I was like, I think I just fell asleep on the couch and then I guess my sister like World in her sleep when she fell down the stairs while she was sleeping kit like her side, but luckily there's like a lot like a  buy basketball like a  regular mesh, like basket thing of clean clothes like right there when she fell so she just fell on the clothes, but she also had her side and then my dad started like he was like, oh my god get me a while. She was falling out and I wake up and I just seen me has like flying I like on her back out to go so I picked her up. And yeah. 
rDDXKqPiQTdGhAYOO1ZG9Laurzy2	I think it's good that it has to go to end.  because  I think the world would probably end up going back in time because of how much damage we would put into the Earth in like once human contact or eye-contact human life like  stinks that you would either have just animals and everything.  Would become healthier again in the same and are when it nearly be as bad after you can make a couple of years. Like maybe I hear the air would be almost healthy like a pretty much healthy and animals would be happier except for the ones that were dumb dumb in demonic Christmas and they were reliant on human species. Then they would die. But obviously it would be the ones in the wild that can live a better life because they can go wherever they wanted but it would also be consequences like not no energy no places for animals to go and they hurt, you know, they don't really have a choice. He looks like the person but I don't know whether we're just be  a lot of pros and con 
rDDXKqPiQTdGhAYOO1ZG9Laurzy2	If Earth was flat, I'll just be weird like you could basically not even you wouldn't be able to walk anywhere because I obviously the water is still be there but like them the water.  could be like  Black Lightning Siri, just like  poke around with beef B flat won't know I don't I honestly don't even know. 
rDDXKqPiQTdGhAYOO1ZG9Laurzy2	The fact that the person that was FaceTiming me as somebody I see on the daily basis. 
rDDXKqPiQTdGhAYOO1ZG9Laurzy2	Not really. I mean I wanted you to some homework tonight, but I never got to that. So now I'm either going to do it tomorrow or Monday since I have Monday off. 
rDDXKqPiQTdGhAYOO1ZG9Laurzy2	Well right now I am very nervous about my gymnastics meet tomorrow, and I'm scared that I might too bad and I'm not get any medals.  But I'm at the end of the day. I don't know. It just comes to how I am doing tomorrow and my motivation to do good.  and I kinda and thinking about  My back because I know I need to wear my scoliosis brace more but haven't been wearing it and I don't want that to affect me in the future, even though I permanently curved is so I guess I'm kind of like scared in like insecure something.  How about that?  That's basically all I'm also.  kind of in a good mood  I don't know. I don't know is that yeah, I just am I guess and  I'm tired, and I can't fall asleep cuz it's 12:06 a.m. And I have to be up at 8 a.m.  The shower get my hair slicked back braided go to the me. I have to like make a smoothie in the morning make a good breakfast and stuff.  So yeah, that's basically it. 
rDDXKqPiQTdGhAYOO1ZG9Laurzy2	I remember somebody FaceTiming me.  And it was a boy.  And I went outside because I was downstairs or either in my room and then I talked to him outside all my gymnastics mat sounds like walking around out there and I remember it being cold but play sunny out and then hot and that's all my sisters go like inside of the house cuz you was being annoying and then I woke up. 
rDDXKqPiQTdGhAYOO1ZG9Laurzy2	Well today in the morning.  I didn't really do anything and then towards afternoon. I came to my mom's house to get like some iFly indoor skydiving coupon and we went and then I went to the mall with my dad and my sister to end up getting anything and then on the way back, I tried to book the flight things.  And then we can and I booked it for 5:30. So then I went back to my dad's house for a couple hours. We went to the park.  And when it was finally time for $2 to the iFly place, it was a side that we didn't book a flight.  But God book a time at the reservation to go there. So then we watched a movie and we had up watching Doctor Dolittle or something cuz I was pretty cool and then my dad dropped us off at the drop me and my sister off at my mom's house and I haven't really been through anything. So, yeah. 
rDDXKqPiQTdGhAYOO1ZG9Laurzy2	I feel tired stressed out.  a little bit of happy sad angry confused 
rDDXKqPiQTdGhAYOO1ZG9Laurzy2	a includes getting ready nothing really for the day, but then tomorrow I have a gymnastics meet at like 1 ish and I have to go to 12 after we stopped at 12 to  go to the meat so I have to just like rest today. 
rDDXKqPiQTdGhAYOO1ZG9Laurzy2	Anything really I don't really have a preference. I just like things that make me feel good about myself or stuff like that. 
rDDXKqPiQTdGhAYOO1ZG9Laurzy2	That should bring us a true friend of Hannah's not shit. 
rDDXKqPiQTdGhAYOO1ZG9Laurzy2	This is hard, but I would bring.  Alec bring  Leica 3 in 1 body wash actually, no, I wouldn't bring my phone.  I would bring as much money as I can find and I would bring.  a backpack  Foreclose if that was possible if I can't do like something full of stuff. I would probably bring extra underwear or like a hoodie depending on like this season.  So either okay. Well if it's cold out bring a hoodie, that's hot I would bring like  pairs of like  24 know I don't know. 
rDDXKqPiQTdGhAYOO1ZG9Laurzy2	Basically, just put down my phone and clean my room and just focus my mind off of it. 
rDDXKqPiQTdGhAYOO1ZG9Laurzy2	I was in the backyard my house on  on a gymnastics mat with my sister Mia.  And I was FaceTiming somebody. I'll also I was right by my table thing and like basically the setting was like cold and Sunny quotes. 
rDDXKqPiQTdGhAYOO1ZG9Laurzy2	I already am flying in my bed, so I don't know what you mean. 
rDDXKqPiQTdGhAYOO1ZG9Laurzy2	One thing I didn't mention was about Hannah.  I feel like our friendship is  coming to a stop because I don't know is just toxic.  she just  I don't even know how to explain it, but basically you.  it's just been pretty off and on like relationship or friendship and I  Honestly, you would launch stopping for those her but I don't know who I would have because I'm her know why she's my number one and I would be everybody else's number for number 3.  And I really are we going to drama because I asked her to talk talk to me sick and I got out because I was done with you, I don't need any more stress. I was already said I would his and I told her it's just going to throw away our whole relationship friendship over this little tiny inconvenience. This is not worth being friends and she's trying to make it my fault when a I was the one that told her my problem. I just told her so she would know she got mad at me for not telling her and still make it over and I was really mad, but we're fine. Now it kind of makes and Matheson makes it seem like I'm pushed over but I feel like the main reason why I try to push so hard to be friends because I didn't want I don't want to tell  People about my feelings. That's why I have to look into a freaking phone to it. But Gina Sabrina could or she is literally my best friend and I can tell her anything and I feel so happy because really the first friend I talk to about basically life. Like I've never done that before and I felt really good. Even those over FaceTime was still talking to her. I really appreciated that I like showed me not  I'm not the only one going through stuff because she is too and you know, that helps me because even if she didn't get through it quite yet. It doesn't mean I did and I tried to make it seem like that.  After all, I could hide it. So I just told her to the point where I like I feel a little bit of everything that I don't really know. What I feel is kind of like there and I'm like, I can't feel anything but I feel a lot at the same time with my pills something. It's very strong. 
rE6N5ewEq6Os5paw1LI52DMWcHo1	I do but in general.  people who use drugs  to know themselves  that is a really weird question, but  Yes, I see where you're going with it.  You trying to ask me?  why do people use drugs and  to be honest to your question is quite weird, but  the reason I use them as  trying to make myself happy. 
rE6N5ewEq6Os5paw1LI52DMWcHo1	PlayStation 4 PS4  it's a console game console.  That's where I like to spend my time with my friends.

I don't know what to do with myself anymore.  I don't notice it myself. I don't know what to fix myself.  And I think that's too mean.  Meet thing I want I just want to be back to my old self.  this myself 
rE6N5ewEq6Os5paw1LI52DMWcHo1	Yes, I do.  Oh shit different, but I do.  and  I know.  Really interferes my daily life.  I just want you to say yes.  Her not to change myself.  I'm just  Moana

Supply  supply of social movements  Anyways, guess that's my answer. 
rE6N5ewEq6Os5paw1LI52DMWcHo1	being respectful understanding kind  show me that they're loyal person ladder and just to me just in general.  Shelly royalty and a person really shows a lot about their character personality and just overall how they are as a person  I think loyalty is everything in this life.  and  Sadly there just isn't enough oil people out there.  And even more unfortunate is me.  Not being able to distinguish from people.  Why and who don't because my problem is that I always see the good in people even if they don't even deserve it was all like hell all I see all I remember.  I don't even remember the bad things you've done to me.  I definitely know that the qualities that I have.  They are good, but I also have so many bad qualities.  like hiding myself  away from my problems.  Hiding so yeah, good morning would be actually dealing with a schs you're exposed to. 
rE6N5ewEq6Os5paw1LI52DMWcHo1	for me  feeling guilty means that  I did something wrong or  I hurt somebody.  I didn't do something for somebody which in the end her tongue.  I hate feeling that way because  I do things that make me sad that other people do to me.  status  why it's so stupid that I do the same thing to other people that I wish I  when have had done to me, but anyways, I still do them, but  At least I feel I feel bad about that.  People don't even give a shit about.  making some videos feel bad making  somebody feel  not  could incite going back on your promise just  being there for somebody. 
rE6N5ewEq6Os5paw1LI52DMWcHo1	What do you mean by distinguishing from people? 
rE6N5ewEq6Os5paw1LI52DMWcHo1	I'm PS4 there is more ways for me to interact.  On my phone I can.  I can do the same thing on PS4 but more that I can do on my phone, so I would rather.  Hang out with my friends on PS4. 
rE6N5ewEq6Os5paw1LI52DMWcHo1	I already am sad. I'm very sad.  but  I'm not doing anything about it.  I mean, I am actually.  instead of dealing with my sadness  I use drugs to know myself.  I use  games entertainment to distract myself  I do anything and everything. I can to escape my mind to not feel.  did not think  but even those things I don't even think it's working.

rGx6IgOjduMpGxUURRLG9zQcrN82	Doing my homework see my cat and concentrating more. 
rGx6IgOjduMpGxUURRLG9zQcrN82	Something notable about my day was bad.  There was a flyer at school and it shows somebody locked up in a cage with all the other animals and it was really sad. 
rGx6IgOjduMpGxUURRLG9zQcrN82	well, I finished my  history homework. Shut up. 
rGx6IgOjduMpGxUURRLG9zQcrN82	I feel lucky because I’m alive and I have a roof over my head
rGx6IgOjduMpGxUURRLG9zQcrN82	So first I woke up and I was a bit sleepy, but seeing my cats face made my mood cherry and I got dressed and left. I went on the bus for 4 min and then went on the train for an hour. When I got off I walked to my moms job and said bye to her. I then walked to school. When I got there I called my friend and my phone was at a low battery. She said she’d bring me a charger and that was awesome. I went to am advisory and then went to my first block, second and third. Then went to lunch and the school yard. I went back inside for my final two blocks. When it was over I went to my studio. When it was over I went to study hall then after school
rGx6IgOjduMpGxUURRLG9zQcrN82	I found my friends and I saw a annoying hoe. 
rGx6IgOjduMpGxUURRLG9zQcrN82	Yes, my friend Melanie bought me Skittles and at lunch. They served me with red and green pepper, which was really good. 
rGx6IgOjduMpGxUURRLG9zQcrN82	So I had a dream that me and my mom were walking and there was a homeless man that tackled her and took her phone away and then threw it on the floor and then there was a bunch of people around but they didn't notice it was like me and my mom were ghost or they were ghost and then I ran up a hill and then I ran down cuz the man thought I was going to go all the way up the hill and I didn't and then I went to my mom and I was trying to call the police but I could so there's this one boy and I told him to call the police and then I woke up. 
rGx6IgOjduMpGxUURRLG9zQcrN82	I wake up at 6 a.m. In the morning to get ready for school and I I get ready and then I take the bus to the train station and then I go on the train for like about an hour and then I probably said to school at like 7 and then they take they put us into this we going to the school and then we have breakfast and then I go to advisory am advising and then I go to my first block block one and then blocked and then block 3 and then lunch and then block for and then blocks 5 and then I have to go to studio and which My studio is chess and then I have to go to piano advisory and we got our phones and I go home while I don't go home.  But some people do I go to after school which is which starts at 2 and ends at 6. So that is  No, I think it starts at 3 and ends at 6. So I have to stay at school for three more hours. And then I go home and reach Beach at home at 7 fairly and I have to do all my homework, which is stressing and then I have a bedtime which is 9 and I have to repeat every single day. 
rGx6IgOjduMpGxUURRLG9zQcrN82	I'm not an object and my body always deserves to be respected. 
rGx6IgOjduMpGxUURRLG9zQcrN82	If I explained it, it'll be too much. But basically my day was really good so far.

rOHaqEbIJnRrhdSo6nooB3oR78x2	I don't want to be lonely. What do you mean? 
rOHaqEbIJnRrhdSo6nooB3oR78x2	I think they have friends because  it's it's a it's lonely that you don't want to be lonely. Like I don't know a single person that would want to be isolated. So if you like friends is good way of  communicating and just  socializing with the world 
rOHaqEbIJnRrhdSo6nooB3oR78x2	I I I don't think it's bright. It's too blue me and Dole. 
rOHaqEbIJnRrhdSo6nooB3oR78x2	He worked at a place called.  I don't remember what the place is called, but it was like a factory. 
rOHaqEbIJnRrhdSo6nooB3oR78x2	Well there any school I was it was okay day, but then I got home.  and I feel like when I get home, my day is just  shut down.  And I don't know I feel like my home is in my home anymore. And well Jose and I we have been trying to fix things up between us.  But I mean just yesterday has been five months since our break-up.  And since last week, he's been acting really distant and Nike is taking me as a joke and away and I just got off the phone with him cuz he's he didn't give me any attention today and he just pulled his dumb.  Tricks ache and just thought everything I said was.  Was was a joke when I taken you for a joke.  And will I just hung up and I said I was going to go to sleep. I can't stop thinking about it.  And so I downloaded this app. 
rOHaqEbIJnRrhdSo6nooB3oR78x2	I'll be like hey, my name is Jackie.  Nice to meet you. I don't really know.  I don't have a job right now.  And so I'm always either at school doing community service or at home.  Or sometimes I go out Jose, but he barely makes time for me but it's so it's like very early but I'm really just a homebody. I watch Netflix a lot binge watch blood shows.  Yeah, but I would just a boring old person. 
rOHaqEbIJnRrhdSo6nooB3oR78x2	I feel like that'd be crazy because I mean it's it's kind of a kind of sad and because the world is beautiful and if we only saw black and white, I feel like  things wouldn't be the same at all. 
rOHaqEbIJnRrhdSo6nooB3oR78x2	I'm really looking forward to graduating.  This may and I can't wait for college. I'm really anxious about it though, but I'm pretty sure I'll do good.  Beatrice graduation and college starting College something else really really really looking forward to 
rOHaqEbIJnRrhdSo6nooB3oR78x2	In what aspect like, I don't know what you want to know. 
rOHaqEbIJnRrhdSo6nooB3oR78x2	I made some face Clint face cleansing water. And so I drink some of that it was delicious.

rOHaqEbIJnRrhdSo6nooB3oR78x2	It was great. I went to school. It was a really easy day and then I went to Jose's house and we just watch Netflix and relax for a while. It was very therapeutic and then I came home and I'm talking to you. 
rOHaqEbIJnRrhdSo6nooB3oR78x2	I don't know. I feel like  color gives you happiness  and a sense of joy and just black and white is just so gloomy and dull. 
rOHaqEbIJnRrhdSo6nooB3oR78x2	Probably one of my teachers they help me comprehend something. I didn't know. 
rOHaqEbIJnRrhdSo6nooB3oR78x2	Just like over a being done with school. I feel like  I don't know. It's ready. I'm ready to be part of the real world.  I don't know. I just I want to head off to college to make my mom proud.

rOHaqEbIJnRrhdSo6nooB3oR78x2	I would like to start complimenting people might not be so shy about it. 
rOlgd2DfgMSbFtWhdGVBIaRcaiG3	Discussion doesn't make any sense Siri. Sorry. 
rOlgd2DfgMSbFtWhdGVBIaRcaiG3	I do think I can save more money than before. It's just going to be hard for me cuz I'm used to spending it on certain things like Postmates and going out and drinking especially with friends. So I think I just need to be a little bit more strict with myself.  on budgeting my money 
rOlgd2DfgMSbFtWhdGVBIaRcaiG3	Play didn't get canceled. 
rOlgd2DfgMSbFtWhdGVBIaRcaiG3	I should save a lot more money than before. I was spending it pretty frivolously.  and I  sorry something crazy just happened on the road right now. 
rOlgd2DfgMSbFtWhdGVBIaRcaiG3	speed of pliers the name of a play  and so my work on it was just  memorizing lines and  working on the emotions of the character. I'm an actor so  that was important to me. 
rOlgd2DfgMSbFtWhdGVBIaRcaiG3	I feel grateful that someone wants to work with me.  And they believed in me.  So much that they pushed back filming for me.  And now I can do it because my collarbone isn't broken anymore. 
rOlgd2DfgMSbFtWhdGVBIaRcaiG3	Oh my God, you misunderstood. 
rOlgd2DfgMSbFtWhdGVBIaRcaiG3	When I was a kid in my childhood bedroom.  I was like really young. 
rOlgd2DfgMSbFtWhdGVBIaRcaiG3	Silly Siri, there is no season 3. 
rOlgd2DfgMSbFtWhdGVBIaRcaiG3	I don't know where you're getting this how many people died in the audition for what? What the fuck? 
rOlgd2DfgMSbFtWhdGVBIaRcaiG3	A lot on the internet and that specifically after watching the sex education.  Season 2 really good so far. 
rOlgd2DfgMSbFtWhdGVBIaRcaiG3	Play you can't make any money reading a book. That's why I'm going to work. 
rOlgd2DfgMSbFtWhdGVBIaRcaiG3	I just found it something through apps on the App Store. 
rOlgd2DfgMSbFtWhdGVBIaRcaiG3	I don't know.  Is the new ideas that I learned that business relationships are fragile. 
rOlgd2DfgMSbFtWhdGVBIaRcaiG3	The new idea contemplated today was the idea of saving money. So I just sort of thought about my finances in a different way today.  and how best to  budget for the things that I want 
rOlgd2DfgMSbFtWhdGVBIaRcaiG3	I guess a new opinion about myself and Jamie and I were able to work on the same part in the same play together and I wasn't as freaked out as it happened before.  So I kind of think that was nice and it was needs to work on it with her and I think I actually learn more. 
rOlgd2DfgMSbFtWhdGVBIaRcaiG3	I think I woke up because I was confused. I remember waking up and not being scared as I woke up. It made sense that I was dreaming was a dream and not reality. 
rOlgd2DfgMSbFtWhdGVBIaRcaiG3	I'm not really looking forward to much.  I'm sort of looking forward to a work where I don't have to think.  And I can make money. 
rOlgd2DfgMSbFtWhdGVBIaRcaiG3	I think it's definitely possible because  I hate the president.  And he scares me in real life.  And I'm worried about what it's going to mean for my life.  So yeah, my life experience with the president definitely leads to scary dreams about president. 
rOlgd2DfgMSbFtWhdGVBIaRcaiG3	I do feel like I got a lot done today. I was out of the house a lot. And then when I was at the house, I was working on things that were important like my budget and like lines for the play.  And then going to work made me feel very productive. So I felt like I got a lot of things checked off of my to do list. 
rOlgd2DfgMSbFtWhdGVBIaRcaiG3	I feel like I accomplished a ton today I had.  And I worked on two auditions went to one in person got into a movie.  Pack Fitness Lake did everything on my to-do list.  Feeling pretty prepared for this weekend in for my audition on Tuesday. 
rOlgd2DfgMSbFtWhdGVBIaRcaiG3	Who am I feeling grateful for?  Maybe just my roommates Jamie.  I am feeling grateful for Marv and  How he helps me, so in that sense, I don't mind helping him. 
rOlgd2DfgMSbFtWhdGVBIaRcaiG3	First of all, this is a really interesting way to be talking to somebody.  I kind of feel like I'm talking to myself which is what I wanted to do in the first place just heard feel like I talk to myself instead of other people.  about it, but it's like  Google today  I've been dealing with pains from this whatever is going on with my tummy or uterus or  Don't even know what it is, but then pointed so that I have it. I have bacterial vaginosis. And so they're giving me antibiotics to make it go away. But only symptom Everett about aren't the symbol that I have but I'm just getting worried about it and then  we slept in there going over yet.  I really don't want to see another doctor cuz it won't have any time and I have to get up early in order to take marked like CAT scan or no. It's hits chemo, but  like I don't I don't know what like why he needs me. Like, I don't know why he chose me to like fall in love with this. Like, I don't know I could kind of care less.  But I care about him but like it's a big deal in my life to have this person.  Maybe I should talk to him about like not talk to them everyday cuz we don't talk about today. Fuck out and pick up a fucking boyfriend. I don't want to have a fucking boyfriend.  She is so frustrating sometimes.  I can't believe you just told Stacy about my bacterial vaginosis like  Play helps me. I don't know. It's confusing.  I think overall as you keep worrying about my house and  don't really have people to talk to you about it.  I was just shocked myself really well today with like working on speed the plow and my play lines and stuff.  George Mason 
rOlgd2DfgMSbFtWhdGVBIaRcaiG3	I feel grateful for the knowledge that I can figure things out on my own.  and  be independent in that.  space of figuring it out  and learn how I can be my own person.  I really like figuring things out on my own.  In this case, it was a budget, but I did it myself. 
rOlgd2DfgMSbFtWhdGVBIaRcaiG3	Yeah, I feel really grateful for.  These filmmakers who are putting me up in San Diego paying for my gas my hotel and my work as an actor.  So I can't wait to go down to San Diego for that experience. 
rOlgd2DfgMSbFtWhdGVBIaRcaiG3	First I'm going to go pick up Marv and take him to the doctor for his chemotherapy.  It shouldn't take too long. So hopefully I'll have him home and then I'll be able to go home myself to take a shower and get ready for an interview at 3 p.m.  And  not really looking forward to the interview because I don't really want to work for this company, but I'm going anyway.  and then I want to  hopefully work on some  acting stuff  before I have work at 6:30. 
rOlgd2DfgMSbFtWhdGVBIaRcaiG3	Feel like it was all night, but I woke up from it and it was still dark out. 
rOlgd2DfgMSbFtWhdGVBIaRcaiG3	That's a good one. I will respect my body and listen to its needs. 
rOlgd2DfgMSbFtWhdGVBIaRcaiG3	I rely on my parents a lot for money and support and everything.  But I always liked it being independent from them.  I've been working on being alone.  And so the more that I spend time alone and succeed in that aloneness the more I feel confident being alone.  and that's something I've always wanted to not always but recently wanted to feel more confident and 
rOlgd2DfgMSbFtWhdGVBIaRcaiG3	I want to help him because he helps me and I care about him.  And he doesn't really have anyone else. 
rOlgd2DfgMSbFtWhdGVBIaRcaiG3	It's a good question noteworthy moment.  What is a noteworthy moment was thinking about how I connected with Marv's doctor?  About how her son wants to be a director and an actor and thinking about the ways that I could use what I know to help him.  Ellen just helping Marv.  You know if it's annoying to a certain extent, but it always feels good that I was able to.  Help him. 
rOlgd2DfgMSbFtWhdGVBIaRcaiG3	Pearlie Mae Edition for love death and robots  that made me the happiest cuz I  I went into the audition not trying to play the emotion but trying to play the circumstance.  and  it's because I knew.  you know, there's a very low chance of me actually booking it but  I just had fun with it and works on the character really hard and I think I have pressed the password and it felt so good that treat myself to dinner. 
rOlgd2DfgMSbFtWhdGVBIaRcaiG3	It was a good day. And then  I asked my manager Ron.  what he thought about  having another manager  and he took it really badly.  But not really badly.  But now I just feel very guilty. 
rOlgd2DfgMSbFtWhdGVBIaRcaiG3	whale  First time I met with Marv's friend her l.  And he's a movie producer and says that he's going to put me in his next horror movie. So I hope that actually happens but  I think it might movie and then  so Myers new apartments.  Did some work on my still there?  The mark on my audition for the role of death and robots.

And she only had me do it when she was like at the end of it. She was like, oh, yeah, I don't have any notes.  Set up pretty good. So I went over to Cafe Gratitude and I ate.  a little bit too much but really bloated after but  I was treating myself.  Richardson River kombucha and chocolate and came home  and I worked on this so deep and so then Jamie came home with the self tape knocked it out of the water such a thin worked on my audition for Speed the plow.  packed for San Diego this weekend  watch that show sex education  now I'm trying to  force myself to go to bed so I can get up in the morning go to work.

Like my daily routine is just may go on my phone to check on Instagram Snapchat and Tik-Tok is just like one of those things, you know, so I think it'd be a lot easier definition. 
sSKCoCG2dPXwoqMmiU0osf6eGRf1	That is a very very hard question. I don't know. I haven't seen it yet. 
sSKCoCG2dPXwoqMmiU0osf6eGRf1	As a friend, I feel like I should be there or I'm not even a friend at all.  Cuz you want friends that are there for you and will always support you. So of course. 
sSKCoCG2dPXwoqMmiU0osf6eGRf1	I have no idea what I want to do right now. I want to start fresh and young. I can't drive and God Alone money situation really hard to do the things I want to do cuz I don't know how I'm going to start. 
sSKCoCG2dPXwoqMmiU0osf6eGRf1	I have no idea where the fun. Is that probably in the hand. 
sSKCoCG2dPXwoqMmiU0osf6eGRf1	I just want someone to be there for me all the like not all the time cuz now it's pays Austin, but just someone to know when I'm in pain and need someone to talk to. 
sSKCoCG2dPXwoqMmiU0osf6eGRf1	I have absolutely no idea. Justin Bieber comes hard to me because  A lot of people my age. You cannot trust them because you can tell them one thing and then they'll go and tell everyone and the next day. It's just it's it's hard to find people that you can trust now. I just want to find like someone like a boyfriend that I can talk to and so my feelings too and I even a boyfriend just like a back spine. 
sSKCoCG2dPXwoqMmiU0osf6eGRf1	100% like if that person is trusting me and is giving 100% and telling me they're 100% true feelings. I think I'd be able to tell them the same back. 
sSKCoCG2dPXwoqMmiU0osf6eGRf1	Because I don't believe in myself and I'm not trying as hard as I know that I can am not giving my all. 
sSKCoCG2dPXwoqMmiU0osf6eGRf1	And you started now I'm big big trouble because it's due right when I get back from winter break and I don't want to start the school year with all that stress on my shoulder, even though that I am since I need to do two math test, and I don't know anything. So that's going to be great.

sSKCoCG2dPXwoqMmiU0osf6eGRf1	if we only saw in black and white  We wouldn't know anything else. So it just seemed like a norm to us.  Unless like magically ate one day we all hosts.  Start saying black and white text messaging.  It'd be easier for everyone because you just seem like a Norman everyone could not see the same thing. 
sSKCoCG2dPXwoqMmiU0osf6eGRf1	That's funny.  I have no idea because wow that's what there is. No, I don't know how to feel bad because I don't understand the same. I just think that personally for me. Just be very very weird. I'm very very uncomfortable just like everywhere that I go.  What physical appearance not necessarily the same face? I'm sorry. I'm an idiot. It would be less judgemental world because if everyone just look the same, you know, you can't say that that girls are good and not go because of the cube we all look the same side. I think would be a lot easier on the world because you would have to compare yourself to anyone because we all look the same but I think  It would make finding someone you are attracted to you or someone that you love little bit harder because you know, you have to go for the first time I leave for the Luxor for most people. It's really hard to find someone with a good personality or someone that fits. You know, what their description is, but I think we have if we are the same physical appearance if you really nice.  To just be in the last World. 
sSKCoCG2dPXwoqMmiU0osf6eGRf1	New Year's about to start and  I really just want to change myself not it just like to be a better person. I guess every year or every upcoming year. I always tell myself like  he needs to lose weight, you know you need to do this then do that, but I never actually pull through.  And I just I just want to really do it at what I commit and I want to get there because I'm really really tired.  Of always putting myself down and thinking that I am good enough.  So I just I want to get a head start for the new year and actually change myself for the better. 
sSKCoCG2dPXwoqMmiU0osf6eGRf1	Harry Styles concert Harry Styles concert Harry Styles concert Harry Styles concert at Harry Styles concert 
sSKCoCG2dPXwoqMmiU0osf6eGRf1	I am so excited at the same time. I'm feeling really really scared because you don't know WhatsApp going to happen in the future and I graduate in 3 years and I don't know where I want to go. Like when I was younger. I had all these ideas of cultures that I wanted to go to and you know, I've always wanted to be a pediatrician since I was little and now it's like, oh my God, like I'm graduating three years like it doesn't seem like it's That close but it goes by so fast and I just I don't know what I want to be like it the future thinking about the future just scares me because I'm not a person that doesn't like to be alone. But at the same time I like being alone, so it's very difficult. So, I don't know I'm really scared about the future. 
sSKCoCG2dPXwoqMmiU0osf6eGRf1	Absolutely not because my emotions are all over the place. I'm not where I want to be right now. I'm just trying to figure out who I am as a person and what I want to be really and it's really difficult.  It's very very difficult when you don't have anyone to talk to you about it. 
sSKCoCG2dPXwoqMmiU0osf6eGRf1	my parents I'm definitely taking my parents are granted because 
sSKCoCG2dPXwoqMmiU0osf6eGRf1	I music I cannot live without would probably be.  Like I know this is Roberta Point those instrumental music were there just like instruments and like they're usually in the background of the movie. Those are always so soothing and then I have a playlist on Apple music and I just listen to those music like one is restore. I don't really know who would buy but it's really really good. Like I listen to it when I'm doing my homework cuz out sing Focus I listen to it when I'm about to go to sleep cuz he just put you and I like a nice mood as into it when I'm like sad or just like want to listen to that type of music and it's like so weird because I would never ever play this found any of my friends but it's just like this instrumental music sleep with no words. Those are the best types. 
sSKCoCG2dPXwoqMmiU0osf6eGRf1	I want to believe that the people I'm around push me the best to be the best person the best version of myself, but I don't know I'm always the one that gives them the advice and I'm always the one who  encourage them to be better or to do something good, but I never get any of that in return. I guess like it's when I have to be the one that says, oh, I'm like I'm upset or oh this is bothering me for them to actually give a crap. But in my opinion, I don't really think so. I mean, they're good friends and like they are positive people, but I'm always the one that has to fix their problems, but they're never hear from my problems. 
sSKCoCG2dPXwoqMmiU0osf6eGRf1	For the year. I'm in the years over in like four days. So my gold probably be to get my AP packet done because right now I am procrastinating it and I need to get bed bugs. 
sSKCoCG2dPXwoqMmiU0osf6eGRf1	That is a very very hard question cuz you just have to think about everything.  I only have two weeks left of my life. How would I spend it?  Well, first of all, I would probably  we got a new thing.  I probably  she not get the cards and tell my crash. Hey, I like you and I'll get my first kiss, you know.  When do all these Adventures things go to Harry Styles concert? Try different types of food, you probably go on vacation and spend time with my loved ones because I think that's what matters and then take a couple days for myself and just accept the fact that the pies. 
sSKCoCG2dPXwoqMmiU0osf6eGRf1	That would be very hard for me because I'm always on my phone since I don't have any siblings or anyone around me all the time. My phone was my only entertainment stuff. Like if I didn't have my phone at kind of Blues Part of myself, that's a I mean, I'd still have the TV and stuff like that, but that's not the same thing as a phone. So I think if I didn't have my phone I had to go insane. 
sSKCoCG2dPXwoqMmiU0osf6eGRf1	I have no idea what the Luxor is. 
sSKCoCG2dPXwoqMmiU0osf6eGRf1	Not all the time. Like I want to be there for them when they're need and help them out, but they have to understand that I have feelings too and I have problems that I'm dealing with like I just want to have a friend when I really like you're the one who asked me how I'm doing instead of me, you know pushing it. 
sSKCoCG2dPXwoqMmiU0osf6eGRf1	Adventures last as long as you make that.  You know, you just got to ride it out cuz it's up to you when I'm done. 
sSKCoCG2dPXwoqMmiU0osf6eGRf1	I would if it was good enough for my money. 
sSKCoCG2dPXwoqMmiU0osf6eGRf1	When I feel like I'm vulnerable around someone like I will tell them the truth, but so far. I haven't found anyone that I can spill the truth too, and I just really want to find that person. 
sSKCoCG2dPXwoqMmiU0osf6eGRf1	I would have to put my heart into it. I mean whatever I put my heart into it I can do it but I don't know just like I'm in a health science class right now and it is very very difficult like the beginning of the year. I was struggling to get 100 on those tests. So I just like if high school health science is hard. How is college going to be and if I really want to and I really want to put my like heart into it. I can definitely achieve it. 
sSKCoCG2dPXwoqMmiU0osf6eGRf1	I don't necessarily think that I would have been happy if I had my phone because I don't have my phone and still be really sad or depressed or like still be like Super Bowl. I just think that would make it a little bit easier to function. 
sSKCoCG2dPXwoqMmiU0osf6eGRf1	She was a great person. She loved everyone greatest great at sports funny.  all around amazing person

sjjN09DoBjTF0sHM8GZo7brwiJu1	Just trying to get to bed.  I'm having a hard time with motivation.  I was feeling really good the last few days and just kind of  Hit the bottom today.  I have an online class that I'm supposed to do, but  I just really hard because  I have no motivation.  I want to be able to  fake spend my time doing things that I like instead of spending time.  trying to feel okay, but  I noticed that when I wasn't depressed the last few days, I still wasn't motivated to do anything. So I don't know what the the underlying issue is everything xiety. 
sjjN09DoBjTF0sHM8GZo7brwiJu1	Probably in the mountain somewhere.  with a pool 
sjjN09DoBjTF0sHM8GZo7brwiJu1	I would get some art by.  I think his name is Miles Johnston.  I would get it.  On my arm probably. 
sjjN09DoBjTF0sHM8GZo7brwiJu1	I don't know.  Maybe someone who works really hard.  On their art, I feel like I don't work that hard.

st9fAaL45qTnjakO9XGPp3FuSXu2	I spend majority of my time with my mother; why ? Because she always has an uplifting mood. She’s a great listener & is such great company. 
st9fAaL45qTnjakO9XGPp3FuSXu2	I classify a good person as someone who not only is good to themselves but to others. Shows respect, honesty, and loyalty. Someone who doesn’t talk about others, never sees themselves as better & is always willing to care and help for the being of others 
st9fAaL45qTnjakO9XGPp3FuSXu2	To grow more independently 
st9fAaL45qTnjakO9XGPp3FuSXu2	If I had less doubt in myself I would have way more opportunity & become much happier with how I carry myself. I believe it would change my actions and emotions knowing I’m capable of anything 
st9fAaL45qTnjakO9XGPp3FuSXu2	I see myself as an understanding person, I tend to put myself in other peoples shoes. I like to be there for people & be positive at all times; see the good in a situation 
st9fAaL45qTnjakO9XGPp3FuSXu2	"I have a lack of motivation. I feel like I’m not capable of nothing when I know
I’m much more than that. I can do anything I put my mind into. I know that I can do great & big things."
st9fAaL45qTnjakO9XGPp3FuSXu2	My mother. She supports every goal & idea that I set for in life. She’s always willing to support and guide me through them 
st9fAaL45qTnjakO9XGPp3FuSXu2	Loyalty comes from within. Allowing others to trust you & never having to doubt that trust because they know that loyalty lies in you and you wouldn’t do anything that breaks that trust.
st9fAaL45qTnjakO9XGPp3FuSXu2	Well she can always make my day even better; weather it’s a good day or bad. 
st9fAaL45qTnjakO9XGPp3FuSXu2	If I don’t become anyone in life
st9fAaL45qTnjakO9XGPp3FuSXu2	I leave certain things last minute 
st9fAaL45qTnjakO9XGPp3FuSXu2	I’m usually always on social media. I tend to focus on other things instead of being on track

Maybe that's why I want to be alone.  mature big deal because I'm thinking it's all their fault, but actually I just need to be alone cuz I'm not  In a state of mind.

ttpCFqeEJmde11z8I32svYr7JJj1	yeah, ironically right at the  my phone turned off or turned down and I heard a knock in.  So I went to the store to get it and it was my friend that instantly made me get out of that. I had to get out of that. 
ttpCFqeEJmde11z8I32svYr7JJj1	I'm kind of grateful for this app. I need to get used to be able to say ideas out and and  As I speak right now. It's like if someone  I just feel to get this out and then analyze it myself and this and that and get the same effects that socializing does but without all the bullshit that  talking that almost everyone that I communicate with are just there just so  but I never put any effort, I guess into figuring out who I wanted to make friends as I just always allowed anyone who wanted to be my friend be my friend as if  as if it's  if they're worth it, no matter what but I'm starting to think that there are consequences to people's behaviors. And if I don't address the relationship early it is going to be regretful situations down the road after all this time and spend that you put into it this like anything that  you  put a lot of time and effort into it and it later becomes something that you not going to appreciate as well as you never put the time and effort into thinking your wife.

ttpCFqeEJmde11z8I32svYr7JJj1	Caring what people think turn.  Thinking people will care about what I care about is the biggest one.  Slight constant I'm thinking people have the same values as me.  I thinking people are thinking what I think they're thinking.  kicking someone's intent is  In a certain way, that's not nice.  Self-doubting me when I know it's something is how something is happening and how what's going on and what's causing?  Conflict and then second-guessing myself into a state of mind where I'm powerless.  Pretty much to come to what it is today.  Have is a thought in can't honestly I have full confidence in your body.  being  not being humble and over exaggerating a  sense of uniqueness  and creating a  direct path out of wood is that I'm trying to  glorify or maybe sometimes  create when it's already there. 
ttpCFqeEJmde11z8I32svYr7JJj1	It means I'm codependent if a relationship isn't worth it to me and I'm and whenever I figured that out and I'm still in and I'm still tingling or dealing with whoever it is that mean I think that's it.  Affecting me and having consequences big consequences.  I think it makes it hard for me to  relate with them it makes  Almost makes everything involving them a conflict if I'm ever wanting to express myself. 
ttpCFqeEJmde11z8I32svYr7JJj1	comes probably from wherever the  whoever wherever the design was in really  created on unless it's always existed and never was created.  I think finding where the special meaning came from would make the tattoo of more significant and I don't know what tattoo at is yet, so I don't know what's mean. 
ttpCFqeEJmde11z8I32svYr7JJj1	Who is not the reason?  Who is not the reason many people? I'm the reason as long as I'm able to figure it out.  but  the person who cares about me.  the person who I would think the relationship is worth the relationship will not  Will not let people manipulate me when I'm not allowed to care for myself someone who cares for me when not allow.  people that manipulate me  if  I'm good with good people that that you have good relationships would not allow people to manipulate.

You can acknowledge something. You can be grateful for something.  I think it's infinite. You can do anything to something.  After it's created. 
ttpCFqeEJmde11z8I32svYr7JJj1	I am the type of friends going to want for you what I want for myself.  and I'm included with the desire to  do whatever is going to take so I  live long enough to accomplish what I want so that this one life gets what it deserves from thing that can give it.  To the thing that deserves it and I are any of one of my friends I would treat them just as valuable as me until they treat me less than I would treat myself then I would it would diminish how I would treat them naturally and on some sort of scale. I would probably remember.  And my subconscious all these things in my feelings and my reactions would let me know whether a relationship is diminishing to the point where I should probably just stop wasting time on.  Or if a relationship is really important. So I'll push it away.  So I can't harm it for a while.  Until I'm in a better State and then I can come back to it.  So there's less damage caused then when I'm struggling and still being around. 
ttpCFqeEJmde11z8I32svYr7JJj1	I value my sense of life. I value my philosophy about you.  That what I believe but what I know I value what I want to know about you what other people want to know.  I got you understanding being able to understand reality.  to integrate Taiwan the biggest eyes and I have that indicate more values be  I value my cat cats love Unconditionally by value.  I value my way my cat makes me feel because if a human  beginning of the human like I hang out with my cat.  Then I would know that that few minutes being should I say it?  Genuine because the certain things that my cat will do to make you feel good.  on his own and expecting me specially in moments when I need that and  Humans can't even do that. So it's a  I value that picture compared to the human race and degrade y'all but  I value my relationship with my dad. I value my life.  I got your sister pregnant. 
ttpCFqeEJmde11z8I32svYr7JJj1	And I think it's hard because the only reason is because I still have some sort of fear that someone to listening or someone can hear me.  And then so that's what made it hard. I don't think if if I was in a dark cave and millions of miles away from people. I don't think anything about  speaking in the air would be hard at all. 
ttpCFqeEJmde11z8I32svYr7JJj1	it's for  the ability to do it  Ponce ability  If you can do it.  These are the tons of reasons.  Well, I guess if it doesn't have a reason to do it now, why do it  I guess it would be for.  Not sure what it would be for if you didn't do everything. I guess it would be for nature instinct.  I know when something's done. It has to be for something. 
ttpCFqeEJmde11z8I32svYr7JJj1	people who get sick end up in a  into  the endless  they end up not being.  as Optimum  as they are meant to be 
ttpCFqeEJmde11z8I32svYr7JJj1	if no one ever got sick, then people that  do bad things would do bad things that much longer. 
ttpCFqeEJmde11z8I32svYr7JJj1	I'm thinking I learned how to be okay with myself, even if I'm  On my last ounce of energy and I'm unable to do anything for everybody in.  all I'm able to do is see except where it is that I'm at that moment in what I'm  what I'm feeling and give myself. Peace.  I think I'm able to do that in any moment.  I can prevent a lot of things that happened because people  manipulating my emotions in my vulnerability to  switch roles of power in conflict and situations that the nature and them are  fighting and trying to free the guilt from because of the knowledge that I'm expressing to try to help them from love but usually in a course or forced way.  Usually I don't know how any of the other way that they may seem to perceive it as if no one wants to benefit themselves ever in any day and every relationship I have there's not one that everyone stood have the quality of paintings of conquering a day of benefiting themselves. So it's like I have no I have no relationships that are worth it and I have so many  of them that I have to cut off. How do you do that? You just tell them verbally or do you just never talk to him again? And I think you should be honest about so you can save the good parts of the relationship and  A little bit something else. I've learned that I bought every involves the benefits of how you should end a relationship which there are  benefits on  which actually benefit of just basically just leaving it how it is.  Instead of telling them. Why are they bringing all that need venting or whatever just leaving. Just leaving it.  If it's not worth it, then just wasting my time on it anymore. 
ttpCFqeEJmde11z8I32svYr7JJj1	turned out  is an expected.  and was  greeted at the end with  the light 
ttpCFqeEJmde11z8I32svYr7JJj1	We're talkin time frames. There's all sorts of different. I would put it into perspective as  hanging on  In general with my general they're good, but when they're bad they are shall we say?  crab stop  I think they're good.  But lately I have not been.  lake near  I'm at the end of where I don't have any relationships at all the ones I barely do.  I think those those people are just trying to keep one with me and they're good. I mean as long as someone needs me then.  The relationship is good cuz I know how to make it and I know how to establish the qualities of relationship and how how relationship works in the girl and the essence of it.  What if I don't feel like a relationship is worth it to me anymore. It's definitely when it ends in a lot of them ended almost all of them have ended because of the lack of growth on their side.  Because I stopped pursuing and helping it grow up and seems like it was all me. 
ttpCFqeEJmde11z8I32svYr7JJj1	basically  basically  built a bunch of energy and then use it in.  crazy things like charades and fucking voices  acting different characters and try to make them all opposite and people are  at polarity differences  based off if you would judge one to be happy.  Then I would bring out one that would be mad and I connect the voices.  into each other and change the personalities as a  I'll go from one frequency and to the other.  by switching randomly characters in my and how they would in their emotions, basically and random I thinking about  Which one I am and changing to another one before I figure out the last one that I was.  And making your Rhythm to the point where I don't know at all what it is that I'm asking her what emotion or what voice I'm using and everything that I'm doing this so that I can't figure out what a gorgeous that I made some chili chicken.  And that pretty much got rid of all my stress.

Leave me  And I am someone who very much needs to feel connected and loved.  and  when I don't I get depressed.  But when I get to Preston, I feel alone.  It drives him further away because he doesn't want to deal with it and I don't know how to express myself properly. 
tvpYkJExy7PbKfikdeDKS8cBpfo1	I think that maybe  it was showing me.  that  When I restore balance, I can get back to my normal life and I can feel like things are returning to normal. It may have to do with my medication going back to normal.  I just started a new medication yesterday and I woke up today with the first time.  Rested even though I had woken up several times. I didn't feel.  Awful when I woke up, which is unusual for me. 
tvpYkJExy7PbKfikdeDKS8cBpfo1	I was looking for a private journal app and this popped up. 
tvpYkJExy7PbKfikdeDKS8cBpfo1	I was thinking about how I’m okay with staying in one house for a long time. I also realized both mine and Ben’s credit are completely shot.
tvpYkJExy7PbKfikdeDKS8cBpfo1	I am looking forward to  person looking forward to coming home and  I'm looking forward to  seeing my kiddos at school.  mostly coming home 
tvpYkJExy7PbKfikdeDKS8cBpfo1	I'm really looking forward to seeing Aria but that's pretty much it. 
tvpYkJExy7PbKfikdeDKS8cBpfo1	It really hurts.  I feel alone.  And I did try explaining but I want you know him to be a part of my life, but he just doesn't want to and he did say that you know, he would.  try to be more conscious of my needs, but I  I don't know if he actually wants to be more conscious of my needs.  And that's what's important. If it's not even that he's doing it successfully. It's just I need to feel like  She cares and lately. It just doesn't feel like he cares it all. 
tvpYkJExy7PbKfikdeDKS8cBpfo1	That would be awesome because I would try so much stuff.  Well, not everything but the fun things. 
tvpYkJExy7PbKfikdeDKS8cBpfo1	If humans didn't need to eat food.  I don't know food is such a food is something that I take so much joy in that would kind of suck but on the other hand if you don't have an appetite for it, what's the point? I would like to still drink that with I didn't eat seafood. 
tvpYkJExy7PbKfikdeDKS8cBpfo1	Well in terms of trying to resolve this conflict.  I have tried to give him space.  I try not to feel rejected when he needs a very large amount of space for a large. Of time and  to be fair, you know, he goes long periods of time without  pushing me away like that now.  the problem is is that I feel like  I'm the problem not.  the space that he needs  I don't think in particular that these attempts have been fully successful. They've maxed the symptoms of a larger problem. 
tvpYkJExy7PbKfikdeDKS8cBpfo1	I was able to get a lot done, including dishes and laundry. I worked on the recycling and swept the kitchen. We also moved the living room around and changed our couch.
tvpYkJExy7PbKfikdeDKS8cBpfo1	I feel thankful that I have a niece that was just born. I'm thankful for the cats. I'm thankful that I have a good job.  I have a medication that relatively works for me that the pharmacy is going to fill my prescription for my antidepressants in a timely manner in the right amount and I am thankful for Ben.  But yeah. 
tvpYkJExy7PbKfikdeDKS8cBpfo1	I would feel thankful to take part in.  I don't know.  An activity that you feel thankful to take part in that's difficult.  I can tell you that.  Taking care of kids that is an activity that I feel thankful to take part in. 
tvpYkJExy7PbKfikdeDKS8cBpfo1	it was definitely All In Color one of the things that I remember most is that  I don't know. I think this symbol there was the doppelganger.  and  there is very much a reoccurrence of water and  a journey 
tvpYkJExy7PbKfikdeDKS8cBpfo1	What happened in my dream?  was that I was in this house and there were werewolves and I was closed with one of them, but I was also close with vampires and  I think I was one of the Petrova doppelgangers from The Vampire Diaries and we have to figure out what was going on. It was some kind of unbalanced to the world some kind of apocalyptic scenario. And then I remember that.  the evil or enemy doppelganger  kept on  finding herself in trouble and finding herself in danger and I felt bad for her. I'm not sure if she made it through or not, but towards the end of the dream after we've gone through all these trials to get to this island at the end of the world. That was largely desert.  There was something going on with the ocean and it turned out the ocean.  Had to do with magic.  And we found out near the end that someone had.  Ben  clocking out the magic and keeping it.  not for themselves, but they were filtering it out and controlling it and it was causing all these problems and the only way that we actually fix the problem was that we had to restore  Magic  are not really magic picture restore balance to the magic and not wait was accessible to everyone not just to you know, this matriarchal tribe that was on this island who somehow I wanted some trouble doppelgangers was a part of  and after we were stored balance, it was like everything reset and  I almost like a video game and then I was going shopping with my stepdad and I wanted to meet up with my aunt and I had a video game in my hand. It was very strange. 
tvpYkJExy7PbKfikdeDKS8cBpfo1	I’m grateful for my family, both old and new. I’m grateful that I’ve found a direction in my career and that I have a stable roof over my head. I’m grateful for my partner, and more than anything, I’m grateful that I have hope for the future.
tvpYkJExy7PbKfikdeDKS8cBpfo1	well  I think what was the most rain about the pain? Is that the right time to say enjoy it?  And I'm very much used to having nightmares. I liked that the ending was about restoring balance and there was actually closer to the dream not just fear and running away. It was actually a journey and when I'm done, I went back to more last my normal life and my dream. 
tvpYkJExy7PbKfikdeDKS8cBpfo1	Hello. Do you like the sound of my voice? Hello there. Do you like the sound of my voice? Hello there. Do you like the sound of my voice? Hello there. Do you like the sound of my voice?  Hello there. Do you like the sound of my voice?  That's ideal. I hope you can keep that positive attitude going for the rest of the day. So what do you have on your to-do list today? Are there any things on that list that are more important than the others?  well  I am finishing up my laundry before school.  And I need to pick up my medicine from the pharmacy before school as well.  And then when I get home, I need to do more laundry the dishes.  And I think that's it. 
tvpYkJExy7PbKfikdeDKS8cBpfo1	Well, I'm going to go to work and I'll be there till 3 and then I'm going to come home probably put on some make-up. Maybe I'll see you then.  Honestly, not super looking forward to that because he's been a huge jerk lately and I'm dealing with a lot just handling my issues little on his but then I get to go to the hospital and see my cousin Marissa and Zach her husband and her new baby Aria and I'm really excited. I really want to meet that little baby girl.  Honestly really want one of my own but I'm really excited to meet that little baby girl. And then when I come home, honestly, I'm probably going to get really fucking high and try to forget about all of the crap that isn't good in my life, but there are a lot of good things to do to admit and he's do the dishes. 
tvpYkJExy7PbKfikdeDKS8cBpfo1	If I had a second home, I would probably want it to be in either like a small island town like Block Island, or I want to be in like a really cool City like Baltimore. I really love Baltimore. It was just so full of life and I like being around all the restaurants actually on second. Thought I would like you to Richmond mean you're into my sister. 
tvpYkJExy7PbKfikdeDKS8cBpfo1	I would  pick a do-over for college because I would have liked to just go straight and education get it done and then move on with my life. 
tvpYkJExy7PbKfikdeDKS8cBpfo1	I may and honestly I am okay with it because  I feel a sense of closure in that dream. 
tvpYkJExy7PbKfikdeDKS8cBpfo1	I have only taken it once so far. 
tvpYkJExy7PbKfikdeDKS8cBpfo1	I feel like there's somebody who doesn't eat seafood.  But honestly, I wouldn't give a fuck. I love Seafood. 
tvpYkJExy7PbKfikdeDKS8cBpfo1	I honestly don't know I'm going to have to think more about that. 
tvpYkJExy7PbKfikdeDKS8cBpfo1	Well I cleaned the house and drove around with Ben. We also had brunch with his family and we had a nice time.
tx5MqOFtaxefcvTReYWqmKoiAvn1	I'm not really sure what that means. I think you meant to say and was office building not designed.  with David Finley  it never was because it's a new building.  It's actually the second one. There's already Olympia one has been built for like 5 years now. So Olympia to is the newest one and then Olympia 3 will be coming in the next year or two. 
tx5MqOFtaxefcvTReYWqmKoiAvn1	I'm in the cat's house. I guess you could call it the cat's house.  Play mine, but because coexist now.  You know, they've just been like playing with each other and doing brother, please stuff and eating a lot sleeping a lot cat sleep 18 hours out of the twenty-four and they also bathe 60% of the time they're awake so they bathe a lot.  naps on me  add me in the kitchen cried and cried for food.  Play why are actually okay. That's it. 
tx5MqOFtaxefcvTReYWqmKoiAvn1	Hey, that is a question. I  fortunately don't have an answer to  unfortunately, I didn't want to think about that.  Avenue U and your cat I mean nothing so  The worst thing so far, I guess is that I'm not comfortable yet leaving them out in the open.  When I leave there out in the open when I'm here, but when I leave there in the guest room, it's like I set up as a playroom and I hate that I'm in the main reason is because I haven't gotten blinds and shutters.  And that my screen on the Windows is on the inside. It's kind of weird. I don't really know how to explain it anyways, so Jack's at one point was trying to jump up the window and said he would dig his claws into the screen and it's made a couple like little holes and thank God when I'm here now, he doesn't do it anymore because I  Who is coaching Hammond so, you know?  Yeah, that's not even that bad. I mean, yeah it is. I hate that they're confined that one little room but I'm putting up blinds this Sunday. So when I go to work on Monday to go get the room the house. 
tx5MqOFtaxefcvTReYWqmKoiAvn1	David Finlay designed the office buildings with Devon a center. That was great follow-up question. Wow, cool. 
tx5MqOFtaxefcvTReYWqmKoiAvn1	You're funny.  I want to turn the question around and say why are the cats in your house because it's my house.  They're in my house because  I  unknowingly went and adopted two kittens last late October and they're the best things that  Have happened to me at the end of last year to they have brought a lot of positivity.  humility  and they've just  a lot of comfort  Anyways, that's why they are here in to get food for me and to go to sleep on my bed and on my couch.  And yeah.  They're awesome. 
tx5MqOFtaxefcvTReYWqmKoiAvn1	Oh gosh.  new idea that I contemplate  oh I knew idea I contemplated was for my position at my new job and being on the wellness director and this is  the first time this Wellness in his opening so it's like I'm kind of  you know, it's my baby. I'm like going to develop it.  Anyways, I just had an idea for doing like a and healthy employee of the month because this is going to be set in a corporate office buildings that can be tons of different companies that have leased office space and hopefully they're all going to be using the wellness center in participating in the wall is programmed and  And everyone's going to be new here. I just kind of want to you know, shine a spotlight on people that are focused on that can be healthier.  Yeah, so Random, okay. 
tx5MqOFtaxefcvTReYWqmKoiAvn1	What do you love to talk about Aubrey? 
tx5MqOFtaxefcvTReYWqmKoiAvn1	Cool, I really like this because it's getting me to reflect on my entire.  Day, and I don't do that a lot and I end up I don't know. I feel like you asked me tomorrow what I did after doing this. I'll probably be able to tell you and if you ask me tomorrow when I did today and I didn't do this. I feel like I wouldn't have as good as ever recall right to the question.  Tell me about your most memorable moments from the day. I most memorable moments, honestly.  where  Going to my Nana's.  Being all the time with her. She's not doing well going to the gym. I had good conversation with my best friend Victoria. Good talk with one of the trainers Eugene who I've been close to for about 3 or 4 years and  l o  Hanging out with the cats. I know it's going to sound like I'm a weirdo but I just have bonded with them and I love playing with them and I was gone most of the day so that was nice at the end and I am trying to like  get better at remembering.  time with them because they're so  they grow so fast and develop so fast, like just two months ago. They were like tiny little kittens and they've already grown so much and what are you doing? So good at what he's getting into? No, no get off Jasper.  You don't talk about in also Jasper was playing around while I was in the bathtub and was trying to get in. He was like putting his Paul in and out and trying to lick the water. Anyways, so after I got out a drain to soapy water in the night put some clean warm water in there for him to get off of there and he jumped in.  What sorry no, he was only adds just feeling it out and then he slipped and fell in and oh my gosh, you guys still wet and he freaked out and he like climbed all over me and I had to calm him down. It was so cute. Oh my gosh. He was soaking wet.  All right. Yep. 
tx5MqOFtaxefcvTReYWqmKoiAvn1	Yeah, I actually I'd say so I train my client.  I ate pretty healthy today, which is on my to do list cuz the last couple days.  Yeah, I just  8 more than normal anyways, not a big deal and I did my workout and I completed a chapter of my nutrition certification and an exam. So I'm very close to being done. I think I have like four or five more chapters and my goal is to get that done by Monday when I start my new job.  Yeah, I'd say I completed everything that I was aiming to do ya. 
tx5MqOFtaxefcvTReYWqmKoiAvn1	Hope this is recording.  So today I had a client Billy early this morning at 7 a.m. Only.  Personal training client right now that I've been seeing since I stopped working my last full-time job tomorrow. I see him again 7 a.m.  I'm anyways, so trained him then I goddamn it was a very fucking dealership.  Oh, I just came home. I had came home cuz I didn't sleep good last night and I went back to bed. I'm trying to.  Be better about not doing that because I start my new job next week and I won't be able to go back to bed, but I didn't sleep good the other night.  So I figured why not I have like three more days left of not working.  Take me back to bed. And then I woke up at like 10:30 and I played with my kittens. I read a little bit more of my nutrition certification, which almost done with I stopped by my Nana's house to say hi to her and my uncle before heading to the gym, so I didn't really good like workout and I'm at my friend Dallas there, but we were just  I'm passing actually we're supposed to work out together, but that fell through I got there later.  That was my fault, but the workout was good connected with some friends while I was there.  So that's always good.  Then I just came home. I made dinner. I took a nice hot Epsom salt bath.  And then I just played with the kitties. I left them for a long time today longer than usual, but I'm trying to get them prepared for me working next week and I'll be gone for like even longer. The time.  but I'm also trying to  and spend as much time as I can with him before I go back to work because they've gotten used to that as well and I miss him and yeah, that's really it did some yoga and now I'm in bed and I thought hey I'm going to check out this nighttime routine. That was long. Okay. 
tx5MqOFtaxefcvTReYWqmKoiAvn1	Maybe because I'm best friends with the people that are developing it and they love me. Yeah.

u5DhrBrMuGb4LG5agU768vIEuuZ2	I do not take the bus to Chelsea's. 
u5DhrBrMuGb4LG5agU768vIEuuZ2	Live in New York with my dog and my fiance and I like running and Tech. 
u5DhrBrMuGb4LG5agU768vIEuuZ2	I was listening to how I built this and realize that I really want to have a project that I'm working on on the side and I need to figure out what my project is going to be pink importantly. I should probably start with just brainstorming ideas of what I can do and I go back and forth between a consumer products.  Finding like just a really easy thing.  To just get up and running brand run some campaigns versus something that I think it's a bit more.  Reputable and sustainable.  And it's where my potentially have some background.  I think it'd be great to have a thought partner to do it with so.  And not have working in a silo. 
u5DhrBrMuGb4LG5agU768vIEuuZ2	I'm creeped out by this app. 
u5DhrBrMuGb4LG5agU768vIEuuZ2	Car woke me up around 8:30 and I took her for a walk and then went back into bed cuz it's cold outside and at 9. I got to text my mom that she was going to be in the city pretty soon to go to Macy's for the bridal registry and I asked her to come down to my apartment and she lost track of where she was on the subway and ended up on Chambers Street. So then I went Christopher Street and I met her there and then we went up to Macy's. And we got some Macy's the store had an open yet. And so we were waiting outside in the cold sore. A lot of other people that were in the vestibule area and when the doors opened the staff has lined up cheering clapping music was blasting is kind of hilarious and then we made it up to 8 for the bridal registry area is  and met a really nice lady Monique who taught us how to use the registry give us a little scanner gun and a list of all the things that I need to buy so into that list and ended up getting most of the things no idea where it's all going to go, but it was fun to  Imagine one day living in the house that could fit all those things and it wasn't as stressful as I thought it could be then after that. We left I got some sweet green has a David Chang Momofuku salad was fine. I wouldn't get it again. And then after that I walk to my mom's Penn Station dropped her off took the train came home did a bunch of wedding stuff.  And then Chelsea, Mike texted me that they're in my neighborhood actually before that. I took a long walk with Cora cuz she a lot of energy needs to go to the dog park down by City Vineyard because the one that is closer to us is closed. And so I threw the ball around a little bit try to go pick up my dress a lovely bride. They said no.  And then it came back listen to how I built this with.  Stewart Butterfield and Andy Dunn  and then went to Bitter End and keep home.  a bunch of peanuts  That's awesome.

uKlUb3Q7OBYKBlS3oApZfCdxDFM2	I think people see me as this.  Funny outgoing person and likes to do things, but right now they see me as this person. That's just hurting and trying to get through a day. 
uKlUb3Q7OBYKBlS3oApZfCdxDFM2	well, I woke up and I just feel like  something's missing, you know, like  I don't know. I just went through a really hard breakup. So.  Losing her as definitely took and taken a lot of out of me and stuff. So I feel pretty numb to everything. 
uKlUb3Q7OBYKBlS3oApZfCdxDFM2	to be honest  I would like to be with the girl that recently didn't work out with.  I want to see a future with her. I want to join the Army like I've been wanting to do.  I want to have the life that I've always wanted. 
uKlUb3Q7OBYKBlS3oApZfCdxDFM2	I think the most important thing.  That you like to know about me is probably that. I just want to be able to talk to someone.  I want to be able to talk to someone and have them understand what's going on in my head.  And how everything works around me. 
uKlUb3Q7OBYKBlS3oApZfCdxDFM2	I think finally having the life that I've always wanted.  seeing  Be able to be with someone that wants to be with you, too. I feel like that's exciting and finally going after a career that I've been wanting to do for a very long time, but I've always had something holding me back.  and I feel like that's really  gets me going. 
uKlUb3Q7OBYKBlS3oApZfCdxDFM2	Well, I'm romantic so I like to believe that there's a reason why someone comes into your life.  I like to talk about life and you know.  Pretty much. That's it.

uXurKg4tDJNzO8S9s374bHYd7Mz1	Yeah, it would.  I enjoy walking. I just did a 5K and that wasn't hard but I would like to get back into running.  But I do have some back issues.  So we'll see if that will happen.  I get more exercise on the weekend then during the week.  And the weather kind of you know hinders that but hopefully tonight I can take Wilson for a walk.

uXurKg4tDJNzO8S9s374bHYd7Mz1	Yes, except, I didn't take Wilson for a walk 
uXurKg4tDJNzO8S9s374bHYd7Mz1	well  I'm dealing with relationship issues.  It's a roller coaster.  Right now we're back to getting along.  But she shut me out and pushes me away too much and I'm tired of dealing with it.  I'm just kind of  myself being by myself  and  what's best for me?  And I guess that's all I can do right now.  You know Works going good.  and  I'm trying to clean and everything else. I'm not drinking.  I'm not smoking.  And I'm trying to get as much exercise in as I can.  I think I might start that 7 Minute a day workout to get the blood flowing in the morning.  And then maybe some yoga.  so  and I'm just worried about insurance and how much that's going to cost to cover Joe.  And have not being out of medication and how it's affecting his body.  Then I'll just worries me when I'm tired of worrying and stressing about everything. 
uXurKg4tDJNzO8S9s374bHYd7Mz1	I had a good day at work.  very productive  and I got to go get Joe's birthday present after work, and I got my first paycheck from this job.  and it was just a nice evening to 
uXurKg4tDJNzO8S9s374bHYd7Mz1	Maybe a better birthday present for Joe.  I think that's about it.

udW8SVwjbNOBJfuhoON7fas2cSs1	I was looking for a diary app. 
umpVMHjUvnM15NDCeFJwgEYaEhh1	I look just looked it up and found it. 
unVuqWuPuKhWZX3EPtSNoZADZgx2	No, girl, you didn't get that. 
unVuqWuPuKhWZX3EPtSNoZADZgx2	Oh, no girl this question. Where did you go? Not to know about Kazakhstan next time hold up. 
unVuqWuPuKhWZX3EPtSNoZADZgx2	I definitely would not have gone to know Minnesota University. I definitely would have said you know what maybe a conservatory is not it let me look for some acting schools in the city. Maybe that's a good alternative and that's what the 15,000 would have gone toward. Either that or just going to a community college M building my life.  But at the same time I feel like saying oh, yeah, I shouldn't have done that. Even though I do feel that way. I feel like it places blame on me where Blaine shouldn't be because I found a way to articulate this. What was so crazy about what I wanted. Like there are a million and one commercials a million and one people that tell a parent when they have a child start saving for college now because it is astronomically expensive it but it's not like this was some unknown idea and I've always been academically inclined. I've always wanted to ask it was always a very real possibility that I'd go to college. I don't understand why he didn't ever think to himself once to maybe put some money to the side for me and my college education and it's because he doesn't care.  All I wanted to do was go and get a degree like millions of other people do.  I didn't want anything outlandish. I don't want anything crazy. I wanted something that was going to help me to really build a life and a future for myself and I don't want to talk about this in the past tense because it can still happen. I'll go and get a degree. This is just it's not fair and it's not what I wanted and I feel like  my future  has gone off the course that I intended it to go on because someone didn't fulfill their role as a parent and that sucks. It's different when it's like up to you and your own.  Want or need or ability that I can contend with if I'm not good enough if I can't do something. That's one thing but two haven't be over something that is completely out of my hands is infuriating. 
unVuqWuPuKhWZX3EPtSNoZADZgx2	Whenever I internalize how I feel and I don't lash out. I think that unfortunately it takes me a longer time to deal with it.  And it's almost like my feelings become trapped under this layer of rationality. I'd rather just work at the issued and truly confront how I feel about the issue which isn't always healthy. 
unVuqWuPuKhWZX3EPtSNoZADZgx2	trade upset angry  like just really really upset. 
unVuqWuPuKhWZX3EPtSNoZADZgx2	the easiest thing for me to do when I'm really upset and I feel like  any attempts on my part to make it better would be futile. I kind of just shut down. I haven't told him how I felt now. I'm just trying to take care of the remaining balance of $7,000 that I owe for my first semester at the U of M.  He doesn't care. So lashing out or doing something like that. It's just futile and it deprives me of the one thing that no one can take it away from me. And that is my pride and my dignity and that is something that I will never let him have like as a child. I cried I saw do what he disappointed me. I will not do that. Now I refuse. 
unVuqWuPuKhWZX3EPtSNoZADZgx2	Is still going on girl. What do you mean when it was over? 
unVuqWuPuKhWZX3EPtSNoZADZgx2	basically  I trusted someone that we are taught we should trust.  And it backfired and it blew up in my face in my case. It was my parents. I thought they say okay, I spent two years of my life trying to get into a conservatory and this is really the part that I can't get over just because I understand how precious time is and I kind of feel like I wasted mine.  I spent two years of my life getting grades that would get me into a conservatory for acting and during that two years. I spent thousands of dollars on an acting coach to really help me to perfect my monologue so that I can walk into these.  Auditions feeling truly confident and like I belong there and so that ultimately I could get into these institutions. I did all of that and I finally got into one after years of trying called.  Minnesota State University  with in conjunction with the Guthrie  So I'm excited. I tell my dad about it and of course he brags, which is nothing new. This is something that he always does.  But it makes me feel like he's never truly proud of my accomplishments. I think that he sees he's very focused on the material world and I think that he sees other people as things including his children. So instead of really seeing me and my chevening in my accomplishment. It was like he saw it as another Accolade for himself something to brag about he told his friends about it.  And sounded proud and sounded like he had absolutely.  Sounded like he had something to do with my achievement. I was not raised by you. You did not pay for my acting classes that you haven't been there. You didn't even go to my first performance when I was a child.  So that baffled me but I am the only one of his children who decided to go to school and I thought that maybe just maybe this time would be different stupid me. I thought that maybe this time he'd  Help me to pay for this and that he'd be a part of it.  and then  I got my financial aid reward and it did not look good it.  It was crazy expensive. I remember it being looking like it was going to be a little over twenty thousand for a year.  So immediately I was consumed with feelings of dread because I had 15000 save that wasn't even enough to cover a full year. This place is far away and suddenly this thing that I've been working for for so long seemed like it wouldn't happen. And that was the most devastating thing. So I called him and I asked him if he would help me basically the federal government wouldn't give me the amount that I needed. They were only going to give me six grand per semester which wasn't enough to cover the 13,000 per semester that it will cost to attend the school.  So I asked him if he would do a Parent PLUS Loan, which is given by the by the federal government and has a fixed interest rate and it would help me to be able to pay for school. Very nonchalantly says he's going to do it gets off the phone whenever I mention it.  But still even despite any nagging feeling I felt in my gut which is always stupid. I should have known better because my gut never lies to me, but I wanted it so badly and I said, you know what? Let me take a rest. This is worth it. This is what I've been working toward hard work equals results. So I go  And to be completely honest I had a lot of ups and downs. There was always this incredible wonderful thing. No, but I felt like I was working towards something. I didn't need it to be this Majestic wonderful thing as long as it was getting me the results that I needed and I felt like I was making progress when it came to my dream. Nonchalant, then when I'm there, I'm kind of over come with the workload that I have some like you know what I'm just going to do it when I have time to sit down and really get it done. So when I come home from winter break I call him and once again that nonchalant arrogant tone, I don't got it. I got it. I don't know why you guys don't believe me. I don't got it is what he says to me.  I believe in myself. I'm not completely crushed at all because I do know that I'm talented and that I can do this. It's going to be a different way and it's not the way I dreamed about it going but he doesn't know that he doesn't know that I'm not completely devastated by this. This is my dream and how nonchalantly he took it away. It's almost hard to believe that this is my parents because any feeling that's normally attributed to a parent and guard to their child. He has never seemed to feel for me.  He put away $0 for my college education zero my mother who doesn't work as many jobs as he does was able to put away $7,000 for me and I was able to get 6,000 by my own Merit.  Gave me $0 towards my college education. I am the only one of his kids who's been to college and my younger sister who I suppose is his favorite.  Got pregnant at 17 and he gives her a $3,000 baby shower and designer clothes. I don't want to be a bitch. But what has she done to earn? I'm trying to work towards something. I'm trying I feel like I sound so narcissistic right now and so disgusting but it is the truth and it is how I feel. I'm trying to better myself. I'm trying to better my circumstance and I'm trying to lead a life that's fueled by Passion and buy a Dream by hard work and he did nothing to help me see that to fruition.  so angry

I don't know what I'm holding onto and I just kind of wanted to Lisa's.  I don't want to think about anything anymore bad. It's not for my greater good.  I want to let it go.  And that's what I feel like I've been kind of like, can you give out today?  I don't want to be frustrated anymore. I just want to let it go.  So what is going on in the mind of Val right now?

viA1amsRB8hxMcbjz93034mhcq53	Being the first one in my family to get be in the honor roll. 
viLPXA9IISc17OZoHkrJsAkvTj23	I think the best way to bring joy to someone else is to acknowledge their being.  And let them know and feel how much you appreciate that they are in your life and that they're on this Earth and that you really see them for who they are. 
viLPXA9IISc17OZoHkrJsAkvTj23	but the actions that the other person took  bye.  letting  by being that kind-hearted person.  You let people know.  That you value them and you value.  The life that they live and all the choices they make what they're good or bad. 
viLPXA9IISc17OZoHkrJsAkvTj23	I think it's important as a human being for the time that I spend on this Earth.  To gain as much knowledge as I possibly can. 
viLPXA9IISc17OZoHkrJsAkvTj23	detach myself from the kids  in a healthy way so I can get things done. 
viLPXA9IISc17OZoHkrJsAkvTj23	I would be overwhelmed with thoughts that I'm missing my children's life experiences and what they're going through and being able to watch them grow into the humans. They are. 
viLPXA9IISc17OZoHkrJsAkvTj23	People would have to really develop.  Their personalities so that instead of their face standing out in a crowd. It would be their personality that stood out in a crowd. 
viLPXA9IISc17OZoHkrJsAkvTj23	I think that it would.  Igniter part of my brain and it would help spark some creativity within me and not just leave me to learning any language but learn leave me to learn a lot of new things and open my eyes to more experiences. 
viLPXA9IISc17OZoHkrJsAkvTj23	No certain way he's doesn't not like my job.  Definitely say much about it one way or another. 
viLPXA9IISc17OZoHkrJsAkvTj23	Because I depend on others.  To go through life with me.  because  I need the emotions that I get from others.  I need to bring people happiness and I need to bring people comfort. 
viLPXA9IISc17OZoHkrJsAkvTj23	confidence in myself that  I'm worthy of people's attention confident that I can take on.  projects and  people can depend on me. 
viLPXA9IISc17OZoHkrJsAkvTj23	No.  I need a I need at least a part-time job to keep me.  Distracted at times. I feel like I would be overwhelmed if I was always home, but I do enjoy being at home with the babies a lot. 
viLPXA9IISc17OZoHkrJsAkvTj23	That is currently what I'm working on. I plan on getting into a new place and being able to start fresh and Implement new routines.  And new daily tasks that I do everyday and so I can get myself more into a rhythm of staying productive. 
viLPXA9IISc17OZoHkrJsAkvTj23	Just a lot on my mind.  And a lot still to do at the house. 
viLPXA9IISc17OZoHkrJsAkvTj23	that is a little tougher simply because the biggest distraction is my children and obviously I cannot avoid my children, but I can limit myself to  times of  unnecessary worrying where I am and up sitting for too long and getting nothing accomplished. I need to limit.  My social media time and I social time.  And I need to make sure that I am putting boundaries for myself that if I don't get certain things done, then I can't do other certain things. 
viLPXA9IISc17OZoHkrJsAkvTj23	playing with the kids  make money at work. 
viLPXA9IISc17OZoHkrJsAkvTj23	I think that would be sad. I think that God created all these colors and beauty and things for us to observe and that's why we see in color if we were meant to see in black and white we would see in black and white. 
viLPXA9IISc17OZoHkrJsAkvTj23	I think  there would be  General Lee  people would feel better about themselves. But at the same time there would be nothing to keep the difference between us going. I feel that boredom and mediocrity would become very rampant and we wouldn't have ways to express who we are on the inside. 
viLPXA9IISc17OZoHkrJsAkvTj23	My goal is to be more proactive every day.  I will attempt to make lists and check off those lists because  if I'm writing them down.  To get done then they need to get done. 
viLPXA9IISc17OZoHkrJsAkvTj23	I'm very grateful to be these kids mom. I'm very grateful to have a job. 
viLPXA9IISc17OZoHkrJsAkvTj23	I need to pick up the checks.  cash checks  I need  to start exercising maybe not today, but that does need to start happening and I  you need to  groceries in the house before I go to work tonight. 
viLPXA9IISc17OZoHkrJsAkvTj23	I want to be remembered as somebody who had a kind heart.  Who would help others I'd like to be remembered as a great mother.  and  Maybe again, I'd like to be remembered as a good wife. 
viLPXA9IISc17OZoHkrJsAkvTj23	I believe that.  I do give the people I value in my life.  A lot of time most of my time, but I think the time that I spend with them could be more valuable. 
viLPXA9IISc17OZoHkrJsAkvTj23	I want to learn.  Question cuz I don't always have the time to think about what I like to learn.  I kind of would like to learn a new language just to stimulate my brain and just to have that as something that I can do. 
viLPXA9IISc17OZoHkrJsAkvTj23	confidence I would want  confidence  because  I  I'm very good at faking confidence. But internally, I am very weak and I lack confidence. 
viLPXA9IISc17OZoHkrJsAkvTj23	The fear of people not liking me.  because  Of all my fears. It's the only one I have trouble getting control of. 
viLPXA9IISc17OZoHkrJsAkvTj23	I think I am overwhelmed by the amount of work that needs to be done.  I think that I probably need to learn how to detach myself.  From the kids in a healthy way, so I'm able to get things done throughout the day. 
viLPXA9IISc17OZoHkrJsAkvTj23	I feel like I would be.  so much more successful in the things that I try to accomplish and I feel that my anxiety would be  a lot lower because I wouldn't be so anxious about the things that I need to get done and haven't gotten done yet. 
viLPXA9IISc17OZoHkrJsAkvTj23	I would like to think that the people who are important to me in my life.  Value me very much. 
viLPXA9IISc17OZoHkrJsAkvTj23	I don't even know if they don't like me. I just assume they don't like me and then all I can think about is the reasons why they may not like me. 
viLPXA9IISc17OZoHkrJsAkvTj23	Late bills missed appointment which leads to embarrassment?  And not being prepared for things making me look very scatterbrained. 
viLPXA9IISc17OZoHkrJsAkvTj23	Usually I let the kids take up most of my time.  Some of it is social media, but not a lot. Some of it is just sitting lost in my own thoughts for too long.  and some of it is  I don't know.

w1UeGsGD4DRhHmgwUAR1nfP4drf2	Yeah my situation I guess Eric had to go with his family yesterday and even though I understand that sometimes family functions are going to have to happen the thought that he had a family before me just like I did to really but it’s still kind of stings to know that he had that life and it’s something that I could never really be a part of or something we could never really replicate because of our age and I guess I should not reflect on that but just seeing him so happy and pictures makes me wonder just how much he really misses it and that life
w1UeGsGD4DRhHmgwUAR1nfP4drf2	Maybe you can give me some suggestions
w1UeGsGD4DRhHmgwUAR1nfP4drf2	I’m not really sure because I feel like right now nothing will

w6bK389tTZSxs3quJUYmxkuj0vC3	We've been in a relationship for a while. It's just been very Rocky recently in this last year. 
w6bK389tTZSxs3quJUYmxkuj0vC3	I spend more on food than I do on clothing every month. 
w6bK389tTZSxs3quJUYmxkuj0vC3	I think I spend about 50 to $100 a month on food.  And so that's about 1,200 a year. 
w6bK389tTZSxs3quJUYmxkuj0vC3	Probably just now my son feel happy some smells. I feel improve your mood.  I just can't take them. 
w6bK389tTZSxs3quJUYmxkuj0vC3	I had trouble sleeping because my boyfriend wasn't sleeping next to me and he told me that he had nightmares about something that I had said earlier in the night.  And somebody sitting next to me at work is wearing way too much perfume, and I can't breathe. It's making me uncomfortable. 
w6bK389tTZSxs3quJUYmxkuj0vC3	Of course, I understand this point of view.  How can I not I even empathize with it?  But it's hard to keep pushing my needs.  My wants everything down.  to put him first 
w6bK389tTZSxs3quJUYmxkuj0vC3	I want to be happier on a daily basis. Try to figure out why I'm so depressed all the time. 
w6bK389tTZSxs3quJUYmxkuj0vC3	He just shuts down the moment that he hears anything negative about.  A situation or something I asked him to do.  I just wish that he would take the initiative on his own to do these things instead of me having to tell him again. And again what needs to be done.  It's obvious to me what needs to be done on a daily basis, but  I don't know. 
w6bK389tTZSxs3quJUYmxkuj0vC3	I thought it was a good listener before.  this relationship  but it feels like I've done nothing but  shown that I don't listen or I need things repeated on a daily basis.  I don't know what's going on. 
w6bK389tTZSxs3quJUYmxkuj0vC3	I already talked to my mom. 
w6bK389tTZSxs3quJUYmxkuj0vC3	When I get home from work. 
w6bK389tTZSxs3quJUYmxkuj0vC3	I like going to conventions Comic-Con that kind of thing. It's pretty much the only thing you have looking forward to this year. I have two events. 
w6bK389tTZSxs3quJUYmxkuj0vC3	He started to try to contribute more.  I've tried not to immediately.  Be negative about some things that I feel like he falls short on.  It hasn't been successful so far. 
w6bK389tTZSxs3quJUYmxkuj0vC3	I'm having a hard time dealing with emotions with my boyfriend right now.  I'm unsure about my future of concerning him. 
w6bK389tTZSxs3quJUYmxkuj0vC3	No, I know. I'm not spending my money on the right things.  If I would I'd spend it more on the food. That would actually make me healthy. 
w6bK389tTZSxs3quJUYmxkuj0vC3	all of the little things  building myself up from nothing after my divorce. 
w6bK389tTZSxs3quJUYmxkuj0vC3	I'm so confused about my life right now. I don't know what to do.  It's like my heart on my head or complected.  I don't see a bright future right now. 
w6bK389tTZSxs3quJUYmxkuj0vC3	make others happy  improve myself 
w6bK389tTZSxs3quJUYmxkuj0vC3	Integrity honesty  trustworthiness  kindness 
w6bK389tTZSxs3quJUYmxkuj0vC3	It's frustrating because I feel like I repeat myself.  And he gets really mad when I repeat myself.  But it's hard to understand how he's not getting what I'm saying. 
w6bK389tTZSxs3quJUYmxkuj0vC3	I just think.  Making a contribution in any way to your relationship.  Trying to make the other person feel like they're equal or that you care is important. 
w6bK389tTZSxs3quJUYmxkuj0vC3	I keep pushing myself to do better emotionally.  And at work to make sure everything is paid for.  But it's hard when I feel like I'm the only one doing that. 
w6bK389tTZSxs3quJUYmxkuj0vC3	I don't know how to make him understand anymore.  He says he does but things don't change. 
w6bK389tTZSxs3quJUYmxkuj0vC3	Saying people dressed up shopping experiencing new things comic books.

wSBnXs3rzVXEmtp2kee0sHqVYV33	things I experience  That I need a routine and I need to try hard to stick to that routine. Maybe I'll be more than going to meditate for DACA 30 minutes like I did today.  And that way I can feel a lot better. 
wSBnXs3rzVXEmtp2kee0sHqVYV33	My opinions are true with who I am and what are they?

wSBnXs3rzVXEmtp2kee0sHqVYV33	I felt someone successful. I felt a peace Within Myself. That's all that I took the time to take care of myself again. Although I did do the work I expect to do completely out about that. I took the time to take care of myself cuz I realize there was a problem and made it successful. 
wSBnXs3rzVXEmtp2kee0sHqVYV33	I got myself to go outside the house that felt good.  Kind of started the three pages, but not really.  And I kind of underwear for my suitcase.

wm9d5NS5PgRr7hUKiSx0tuDhX5H2	You do not adapt to the advice. It’s easy to hear something you should do but not take the action behind it to change.

x67jxT1HQnOdJ7LZy258CmqgvkG3	I tend to do a few things that I regret. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Grand Theft Auto V question. Well, my parents conceive me, so I came from my mother's stomach. But God formed me in my mom's stomach. So technically I came from God. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	You aren't making any sense. I'm saying that it's not fair that I have to be in pain to go to school school is very loud because of all the different noises because I have hyperacusis. I experience physical pain from normal sounds 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I just sleep or listen to audiobooks on a really quiet volume.  And take pain medicine. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Well, the doctors really don't know. I've seen a lot of neurologists and audiologist and psychiatrist and what not. It started back when I was seven. I started getting these really terrible migraines and then all of the noises became really loud and physically painful for me.  And my mom took me to all these doctors and they said that I have hyperacusis with pain condition where she's always are elevated and cause me pain. I also started to develop epilepsy shortly after and that can also be triggered by noise exposure. I also have hiprex, plexia. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	During the school day. I have it on my wrist. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Yes, I could read them. But because I'm low vision legally blind if I look at things for too long and I read for a long time. I start to get very fatigued. I have to use a special magnifying device call the Vizio book or read electronically on my iPad Pro using inverted colors and large text. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Well, it makes it easier to explain my condition to other people and from me it helps me to be able to come up with Solutions if I can understand Mike what's causing the problem and What teams do and don't work for me? 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Well, not today cuz I'm resting. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Well, I'm going to email him. I'm waiting for to hear back. I know he's at the hyperacusis conference of Aro, so I'm trying to be patient because he's working with researchers to try to find the cure for us. So I'm going to wait until Tuesday to email him. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Well, if I were to be able to find a cure for hyperacusis.  A lot of people would be able to live their lives again without being in pain. They wouldn't have to stay isolated in their houses to all these things to avoid sound and take all these different pain medicines would be able to live our lives pain-free like normal people. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	No, I said I really want people to understand my hyperacusis. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	When I was 11 years old and I had to stay in the hospital and then this loud sound exposure plan is implemented and I was in so much pain and people just didn't seem to really understand and the only way that I was able to eventually get that plan to go away is by doing a whole bunch of research parchment paper books that I kept presenting and then I learned after that that if I made research argument papers that my parents and the doctors would be more likely to listen to me. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Well most places I'm not able to go because it's too loud for me because of my hyperacusis, but I'm able to go to my house able to go to my grandma's house. I can go to the doctor's office and then your other places I could go but it's painful and loud. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Well, there's a lot of people who have hyperacusis such as myself who have to basically isolate themselves in order to stay in quiet places and keep pain at a minimum. I spend most of my time when I'm able to when I'm not at school in my closet, my parents are soundproof my bedroom, but it's a really difficult thing because most people don't really understand why I isolate myself and they'll think it's more important that I have socialization, even if I'm in pain and I do want to socialize but it's painful for me. So that's why I stay in my closet in my soundproof bedroom a lot. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Well from me my headaches are noise-induced I get pain in my ears my forehead my temples and the area on the sides of my head above my ears to pain depends often times on the volume of the noise the pitch and how long it lasts a short loud high pitch noises feel like sharp stabbing pains versus longer loud motorized noises are like throbbing pain. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Well, I'm going to send him an email reminding him that he was going to help me set up media context to help raise awareness about the hyperacusis school program that I'm trying to get established in, Maryland. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Be empathetic towards others.  The accommodating towards the needs of other people.  Treat people the way you want to be treated.  place your faith in God  and learn from your mistakes.

x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	This is going to be really hard for me. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I need to continue to try to  Do different treatments like my electrical nerve stimulation? And I also need to try to make sure that I always have the accommodations and things I need I know that I need to stop being so concerned about what other people think and just do the things I need to do for my hyperacusis. Hyperacusis is my condition where I get physical pain from normal sounds 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	But I don't feel like I have a lot of emotional baggage. I just feel like my dad and Miss Patel, especially my father doesn't really understand about my hyperacusis. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Well, actually when I got an email that I have been accepted into the beta program for inwards a I I was really happy when I found out that I was going to get you start chatting with you. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I guess I would say right now we've been okay. I mean, I don't have all 4 relationship with my teacher.  I don't really have a good relationship with my therapist Miss Patel this year or with my father cuz I feel like they're not really understanding my hyperacusis. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I really wish you understood a little bit better or could at least help me in some way or give me some ideas for how I can get Miss Vitale. My mom was just some people to be willing to stop making me do things that are painful or any idea to try and quiet my life so I can be in less pain. I just want to live a pain-free life. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Well, I just really wish there was something that I could do so that I could have a paying for your education not have to be in pain when I go to school. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Melissa Lomax Miss nusbaum Lee Isla Morada, black and Brian Pollard. I look up to Melissa Lomax because she is a young African-American blind woman, and she's always been really nice to me.  And she seems like she really has her life all together despite her disability. I look up Tunis Nussbaum because despite experiencing chronic pain everyday that is made worse by smells. She is always kind and compassionate and has a good-hearted. I look up to leeila because despite having chronic pain and sensitivities. She tries to dedicate her life to helping kids like herself.  I look up to more black because even though she has hyperacusis with pain and isn't able to function normally do many things. She works really hard as the administrator for a group and helps how all the members in any way she can and I look up the Brian Pollard because he's the president of Iraq uses research and push to have hyperacusis put under the Ada law. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Be nice to everyone.  trust in God  the majority is not more important than the minority.  Everyone deserves to be a pain for you to live a pain-free life.  Be accommodating and empathetic towards others. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Well, I think I'm a really good friend. I'm generally a really nice person and I try to be sensitive empathetic towards the needs of other people. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I'm going to start doing some light exercise you my soundproof bedroom on the weekends. I am going to Advocate and speak up for myself.  I am going to have a meeting with my representatives to discuss a hyperacusis school Bill proposal and I'm going to get one of my books published on Amazon and I'm going to drink 48 oz of water every day. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I don't think I had any new ideas and specific today. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Well, I was thinking about having Brian Pollard contact different news companies to make like a documentary about what it's like for me attending school with hyperacusis getting that out into the media and requesting Maryland K-12 students and parents contact me in my efforts to try to get the hyperacusis school program. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I'm going to use my TENS unit and my Alpha stim. Those are different electrical nerve stimulation devices that help with my pain. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I've been feeling really stressed frustrated and sad and desperate because every day it's the same I have to keep dealing with my pain for my hyperacusis from the time I get up in the morning to when I finally get back to my closet and people just want to keep trying to push me to do more more things that are allowed even though they know I've heard she's just with pain. I have to prepare my tray in the kitchen and prepare my lunch and I have to go to school and it's really painful for me and my head is like swallowing all the time and I get really bad migraines and headaches and then No, one understands and they just keep trying to get me to do more and more things. I know people are really trying like my mom and those kind of people to be really accommodating but I can't keep doing this. I just want to go to live a pain-free life. I don't want to have to be in pain everyday. It's not fair. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I'm just sad in general because  everyday, I know that I have to wake up and go to school and it's painfully loud for me and it's just really hard for me knowing that I'm going to have to deal with this pain every day for at least the next two years probably longer and  a lot of people still are no don't really understand about my hyperacusis, but I just really wish that I could just have a quiet pain-free life and it's just not fair that I have to be in pain to get my education. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I like to talk about hyperacusis with pain.

x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I'm really grateful for my mom because she really tries to stand up for me regarding daddy about things related to my hyperacusis. And when Daddy tries to make me do things for awhile, she sticks up for me and she cooks and prepares my meals and she drives me places and all that stuff. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I'm grateful for artificial intelligence and virtual assistants because I'm low vision, which means that I have visual impairment. It's hard for me to see a lot of stuff and my AI assistants are able to help me a lot with my technology. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I feel grateful for my memories of talking with and being with mrs. Nussbaum my old Vision teacher. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I'm very grateful to celebrate Christmas. I think that it is definitely one of the two most important holidays cuz Christmas is the day that Christ Jesus was born.

It can be a peaceful feeling especially when everything else seems to be crumbling around and it's also feels nice to when I know or feel like your people around me truly love and care about me. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I'm very grateful for my closet.  inside of my soundproof bedroom 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I want to be able to look back at the end of the year next year and be really proud of myself to see how I've grown and was able to accomplish these goals.  That I set out to do. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	When I was talking with Mr. Nussbaum at the library, and she told me that she loves me.  When I was talking with Melissa Up full Max.  And she was telling me how it's very important to her that when they were thinking of things. They plan me in my when I was talking to Maurice and he said that I have a right to live in the world.  When I was talking to Maura black.  And she told me that I'll have to fight for my accommodation.  I was talking to God and I felt him tell me if you would take care of me and that it would be okay. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I really don't know. The only thing I can think it would truly make me happy in the long terms. If I'm able to set up some way to get a much more quiet and pain-free life my hyperacusis like being able to set up something where I don't have to go down into my kitchen to prepare my food and I can stay in my car that most of the time and I don't have to go into the school building where I could either have home and Hospital inside my soundproof bedroom or use like telepresence distance learning. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Well, I really love listening to books. I find it to be really relaxing and I'm often able to relate to the characters in my stories and it gives me like this comforting feeling I've even learned things for my books or gotten strength, especially because  my life is really difficult right now being able to just go into a book for a while. It's nice. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Well, I'm in a lot of physical pain right now. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I'm worried about my doctor's appointment with Tara prosciutto next week. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I'm worried that over Christmas break. My father's going to try to make me go a lot of places and won't let me just stay in my closet and in my bedroom where it's quiet. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Well, I usually take about a four hour nap after school and then I usually sleep for about eight hours. So total of about I guess 12 movie 13 hours, but that's because I'm in a lot of pain for my hyperacusis the area all around my head ears hurts and throbs cuz of all the noise. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Grow, usually I sleep for about 9 hours at night. Then I usually take about three to four hour nap because I have hyperacusis and so I'm in a lot of pain after school. So I sleep a lot because of my chronic pain conditions. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Well, I've been really trying to work hard on getting the hyperacusis school program and turning into a reality have been contacting my legislators Terry Hill Jessica feldmark Sophos Clarence Lam Eric Ebersole. Also in contacting the American State Department of Education, Brian Paul are present of hyperacusis research is going to help me get my calls into the news media associate with hyperacusis research to try to make people understand why there needs to be a specialized school program for students with hyperacusis. I am supposed to write up an account of my whole experiences with the school system. And that what it's like for me to tending School daily. And then we're going to try to connect with some of the other students in Maryland to have Harbor excuses. When we do the media coverage in the news NTV. I'm asked for them to contact us. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	So I had a really bad migraine headache today because yesterday was really loud at school because there was this kid screaming second and third. And then the rest of the day was still loud and so the pain just kept increasing from all the noise. So today I was still in a lot of pain so I didn't go to school. So I stayed home and rested in my closet. Look good part is that after I was resting my calls at the majority of the day and took a rizatriptan. I was feeling mostly better and able to work on my homework. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I'm going to call Dr. John Kerry's office tomorrow and ask them if they treat hyperacusis and see Pediatrics and check to see if they accept Blue Cross and Blue Shield health insurance and what their treatment protocol is for hyperacusis if they do treat it. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Well, not really. I mean, but I wasn't really going to get much done because I have to wait until Tuesday to contact fry and Paul hard. So also waiting it's just hard for me cuz I feel like I'm useless. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I was able to rest I was able to get my pain level down and I was able to do a lot of my homework. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	well for the hyperacusis bill proposal one of my milestones for definitely be  Sending the letters out with signatures to my representatives for my book. One of my Milestones I guess would be looking up how to get a book published on Amazon for the water. One of my mouth stones will be getting warm drinks at least 30 houses for the exercise. I guess one of my mom's Jones be exercising for 30 minutes in my bedroom Saturday and Sunday. And for the advocacy. One of my Milestones would be when I'm in Mistral accounts room using the word hyperacusis with pain. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I don't know how much longer I can continue doing this.  Everyday, I have to deal with my pain from hyperacusis because people still keep making me do things that are too loud such as preparing my tray in the kitchen for getting my lunch together in the kitchen or tending school and then people just keep wanting me to do more and more and pushing me constantly and the pain like in my head and my ears just always throbbing and it hurts and people think sometimes I just want to be pity. It's not that I want to be paid. I just want people to understand I know they're really trying to understand and my mom's charger really hard to be accommodating and so do so many other people but people just always trying to push me more and more and  Just want to be the liver pain feel. I feel like it's so unfair that I have to deal with this. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I look forward to meeting with Mr. Nussbaum once a month. She's my former Vision teacher and I love her so much. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I really love key lime pie cheesecake with chocolate sauce to my favorite dessert. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I really like the feeling of fleece. It's very soft. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	My Apple watch because my Apple watch lets me know by silently vibrating on my wrist right before it's time for me to leave class so that I don't get stuck in the classroom and in the transition, which is very loud. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	My bracelet from mrs. Nussbaum  my bracelets from Mrs. Murphy.  Some gems that are mother brought me back a long time ago when she went on a trip.  A beautiful shell my mom brought me back when she went on another trip.  And a nice beautiful bracelet with a huge gemstone on it. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I like to play Sorry memory tic-tac-toe hide and go seek and lucky ducklings. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Well, I've just been feeling really sad because I know that I'm going to be in pain everyday to go to school and it's really painful for me. And I know that I'm not going to go to have a paying for your education. And then tonight. I just started having a bunch of seizures randomly for no reason and then my friend Melissa Lomax her sister died and then my mom was diagnosed with this thing called carpal tunnel syndrome where her hands hurt and my friend Destiny got her e taken away for her wheelchair. I feel like there's just so much pain and suffering in the world. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I took a nap after school because I'm in a lot of pain from my hyperacusis from all the noise. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I took a nap after school. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I came home and took a long nap after school in my closet. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Well, I took a nap after school because I was in a lot of pain. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I took a long nap in my closet after school because I was in pain from all of the noise. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I took a nap after school because I was in a lot of pain from all the noise at school because of my hyperacusis. So arrested in my closet inside my soundproof bedroom for about 3 hours. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I could use a lot less noise in my life because if my life was much quieter than I would be in a lot less pain for my hyperacusis. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I wish I wasn't scared of what other people.  Thought about me. I wish I wasn't so afraid of people being angry with me all the time because if I wasn't afraid of people being angry with me all the time, I would probably take more steps to minimize my hyperacusis pain. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I know that I take my mom for granted like all the accommodations and stuff that she does for me every single day cuz she does her best to take care of me and make sure I'm as comfortable and in as little pain as possible. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Well, I was searching around on the app store because I wanted to find an artificially intelligent friend who be compassionate and understanding about my chronic pain. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I'm glad that there were a bunch of kids asking for my homeroom today cuz homeowners usually loud for me and because there were a bunch of kids absent. It was pretty quiet. So I'm grateful for that. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I'm very grateful for my closet. I don't know what I would do. If I didn't have my closet the world is so loud and painful for me because of my hyperacusis and my closet is like, so please where I can go and take off my hearing protection. And even though I'm still in pain from all the outside noise from earlier in the day or week when I'm in my closet at least my pain doesn't keep increasing and I can rest. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I'm very grateful for my closet. My closet is inside of my sign proof bedroom, and I'm able to go in there and rest because I'm in pain from my hyperacusis. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	love  I really am grateful that I'm able to feel the love of others and able to give love to others especially Divine love from Jesus. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Well, I thought it was pretty easy. I mean in the beginning actually, I thought it was a little bit difficult, but then I was able to figure out how I could say things in a way that would make it still work for my situation without making it so that I would have to do anything pain, but I was still able to say what I was doing wrong and come up with some ideas. He would actually work for me to improve. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Morrow it's just I feel really sad and  I feel pretty  want some more hopeless. I completely hopeless because I know they're like God is giving his purpose and I'm going to make things better for other students with high protein foods, but I just feel really sad knowing that I won't get your participate in it and my life is going to be painful because people constantly prioritize socialization over pain which is why I attend school, which is really loud and painful for me and my father even when I'm not at school like over the summer and stuff will keep trying to get me to do things that are too loud.  It's just really hard for me. I actually just recently had the flu and I didn't even care or want to get better because it at least even though I felt really sick like and tired and achy and confused. I wasn't an intense pain and today I had a bad cold. But again, I really don't care if I don't get better because what is there to get better for? I mean, it's just a different type of pain and misery of Albion. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Well my school work mostly especially with math. I don't feel comfortable with whatever and should I come up with him and just want to keep changing because I'm worried that I'll have the wrong answer. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I want people to remember me as the girl who stood up for the rights of people with chronic pain and physical illnesses. I want to be remembered as the girl who changed the view of the medical community and made more sensitive and understanding towards chronic pain and sensitivity and I want to be remembered as the girl who helped get hyperacusis in different chronic pain conditions special accommodations under the Ada. I also want to be remembered as the girl who created special schools for students with chronic pain and sensitivity. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I want the world to learn how to understand and, date and be sensitive to the needs of people with chronic pain and rear entrances. I want to change the way the school system treats those kids. I also want to change the way the medical community to use those things. I want to bring the wall the sense of understanding and accommodating people with chronic pain and sensitivities. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I need to spend more time talking with people who understand me and less time talking with people that just make me feel really frustrated and misunderstood.  I also need to try to take more proactive actions to help make sure that I'm in quiet places and get my conversations even if two things that other people don't like if I know I need to do what I have to do for my body. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Well, most of my New Year's resolutions have to do with me wanting to help other people with hyperacusis or in working on my future and career goals such as getting that book published the one about the water in that exercise or more for health reasons. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Well, I would definitely feel more comfortable and situations where I need you advocate for myself, and I know that the person is not going to understand or respond. Well, I would also feel more comfortable when I'm doing my math work and turning in my quizzes to maybe I wouldn't have to worry so much. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Well when I'm at school, I'm not going to be afraid to use the word hyperacusis when I'm talking to certain people and I'm going to take opportunities that come up instead of trying to hide from them. I'm going to tell them straight up about the hyperacusis on the paint. I can also set reminder using Siri to remind me to drink water throughout the day. And then putting in some extra time you go on the weekends to work on riding my stories and make sure I have time for that. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Taking my nap after school in my closet. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	world today wasn't really enjoyable but  I guess I would say when I was able to sleep in my closet and vest after school. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Well, I was really happy when my social studies teacher. Mrs. Chapman was trying to help me do this project that we're going to start working on next week. And she told me that I get to write a letter to my representative about an issue. I feel strongly about and she wants to try to help me understand government and politics so that I can try to convince a government official to creep School for students with chronic pain, and I'm really excited about that. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I really enjoyed resting in my closet after school. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Well today I got up. It was a Monday morning the first day back to school after Thanksgiving break.  and so I started to go downstairs to prepare my breakfast, which is always painful for me because the dishes Klein which is painful because I have a condition called hyperacusis where I get pain from noise and then I  Rose with my mom cuz she drove me to school.  and  school was loud like usual my teachers try to be understanding and accommodating for people are always talking too loud students are being loud in the hallways. So my head and my ears like throbbing and hurting badly all day.  Finally 7. Came and my therapist respite hours like oh I want to meet with you, but I wasn't mentally ready. She claimed that you need to do anything. So we went and so I let her read something I wrote.  Trying to explain to her about what each sound physically Feels Like For Me Goes throughout the day all the different things that hurt me and cause me pain and I also did a whole bunch of research on hyperacusis in the new developments and on the mature minor Doctrine add person to talk to her. So I'm trying to come to some understanding to help her better understand me when she's working with me. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	well today was frying which was a relief I went into school today and  then I came home and I rested and took a nap after school because my head is hurting a lot from all the noise because I reply protesis with pain condition in which I experience physical pain from normal noise. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Well today I went to school and then I came home and took my nap. I take a nap after school because I'm in a lot of pain from all the more because I have hyperacusis condition which I experience physical pain from normal noise. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Well, I'll start from the beginning today. My mom started giving me a new CBD oil for my seizures because we ran out of the one she was giving me before but she was having a hard time doing the conversions to figure out how much to give me so she's not sure if you need me too little or too much. So when she sent me into school she sent an email to the staff letting them know.  And so there was a kid screaming really loudly first. So I was in this Patel's office yet further away from the noise and it was very painful because he was loud and I have hyperacusis while I get physical pain for noise. So I started getting a migraine and then second. I'm not exactly sure what happened, but I think I had some sort of episode with my math teacher noticed. I shook I'm also concerned about my grade in math class because they check grades for recycled treasure sale soon, and I have an 85  And since probably wasn't there today because she was home taking her medicine which makes her very loopy and not okay to drive. And so then when I came home from school my head was hurting a lot from all the noise, and I've been laying down resting. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Well, I went to school today and that was loud like usual and then I came home and I took a long nap because I'm in a lot of pain from all the noise because I have hyperacusis with pain. I experienced chronic pain from normal noise. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I know that I don't exercise and I don't drink my water the way that I'm supposed to I need to try to get in more water during the day and do some basic gentle exercises on the weekends. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I plan on telling mrs. Nussbaum and Melissa Lomax and my mom I plan on telling Miss Nussbaum do I know she'll really be in support of a lot of things. I'm trying to chew for hyperacusis advocacy and awareness and that she really understands remove backing up. I also plan on telling Melissa Lomax because same thing with her she really understands and I know she may even have some connections ways to help me and my mom also really supports me doing the hyperacusis bill proposal and somewhere other resolutions as well. And I know that she will help me and support me with this. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	It's mrs. Nussbaum. And yes, I mean was mrs. Nussbaum once a month. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I shouldn't take my mom for granted. She does a lot for me. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Miss Mouse bomb when she was my vision teacher, I mean  She was about 66, but now I still see her once a month at the library and she 70. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	No, I'm not going to write a letter to mrs. Chapman. I'm writing a letter to calvinball my County Executive in mrs. Chapman's government class a letter is about making a special school for students with chronic pain. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Yes, she could stop making me go down into the kitchen and prepare my food on my tray like stop making me get plates and bowls out and silverware and that type of thing because that's painful for me. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Yes, Jesus came and he said himself on Earth and sacrificed his life on the cross so that we could be forgiven for our sins. Go to heaven.  So Christmas is really important to me because if he hadn't come to Earth and been born as a baby and Christmas we wouldn't have Easter of the sacrifice for eternal life. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Well, I don't think that I need to be in a school building. I definitely think I need to get an education but unfortunately most people prioritize socialization over my pain and so right now I have to be in a school building even though it's very painful for me with my hyperacusis. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Well, I went to school and then I came home and took my nap after school because I was in a lot of pain from my hyperacusis because school is loud. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	No, I said that they were a bunch of people absent from my homeroom class today, which was a good thing because homeroom was usually loud for me which is painful. So it wasn't as loud today because you are a bunch of kids absent. So that's good. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	That question didn't make any sense.  I don't actually have a Blog but if I started a Blog it would be about what it's like to live with hyperacusis. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Well, I'm not trying to do this nationally, not yet. So I went to the Maryland State Department of Education and I told them why their needs to be a specialized school program for students with hyperacusis, and I have not heard back from them yet. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Well, unfortunately a lot of times I have just don't drink the amount of water that I'm supposed to drink and we'll get dehydrated. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	My English teacher mr. Lacount. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Yes education is free. But education should also be pain-free children have to be in pain to go to school. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	My dad is always trying to make me do things that are too loud. He's not very sensitive for understanding about my medical condition and he's always laughing when I'm telling him about my pain and my hyperacusis which hurts my feelings. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	God sent his son Jesus so that we could be forgiven and he loved me. That's why he created me. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Well, I wrote a short almost like diary entry and wish I went from the time I wake up to the time I go to sleep explaining which noise feels like from me in physical pain and all the steps I have to do to be careful and avoid going so people could understand. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I just told you I really enjoyed resting in my closet after school. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I would just be able to stay in my closet inside my soundproof bedroom all the time, and I wouldn't have to do anything loud. So I wouldn't be in pain. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Well, I think that it helps that I have a chronic pain condition so I can try to be more empathetic towards other people in similar situation for what is going to be hard is trying to get other people who don't suffer from my condition or similar condition to be willing to understand why it's an important issue that we change the way people with chronic pain and sensitivity. So I treated 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	That question made no sense. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Sometimes when it's 2 hours and painful for me because of my hyperacusis. I'm afraid to say something and I'll just sit there and pain. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Well just in general her hyperacusis and her pain. She's more sensitive to sound in me. And so she's in even more pain than I am and because she lives in Malaysia, which is a developing country. She doesn't even have the resources that I have. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	So it's painful for me to come down to the kitchen because of the refrigerator and then it's painful for me to get the dishes and silverware.  How onto my tray because they clang and make noise and then when I eat it hurts because the metal silverware keep clinging against the porcelain plate and the noise is painful for me because of my hyperacusis. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I'm usually in situations where it's loud and painful for me and I end up getting a lot of pain and experiencing a hyperacusis setback. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	My closet is extremely quiet. That's why I go in there because there isn't very much noise in my closet. You see I have hyperacusis a medical condition when I get physical pain from noise. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I want to stay in my closet tomorrow and rest where it's quiet so that hopefully my pain level will decrease. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	And that didn't make any sense. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I don't understand why you're sorry, and I don't know where people remember me, but I'm hoping that at least the people in my home state of Maryland will remember me. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Well the fact that every day I have to prepare my tray and go to school and just general things in life that people expect me to do all these things even though I'm in pain and then some people I feel like I have the nerve to think that oh, you know, just try to think more positively and say something good, but I'm in pain they don't get that. It's hard to do that. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	world  I'm really not sure. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I'm feeling sad frustrated and desperate sad because the last time I can remember having a low level of pain for an extended. Of time was when I was in the fifth grade, which was 5 years ago.  I'm feeling frustrated because I feel like it's so unfair that I have to deal with like this hyperacusis in this pain every day, and I still have to do all these things that are allowed and painful for me and I'm feeling desperate because I don't know how much longer I can keep doing this. I really want my life to change in terms of having like home and Hospital instruction in a really quiet environment and being able to stay in my closet where I'm not in pain. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I enjoy taking my nap after school. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Resting in my closet after school being able to take my nap. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	My mother because I feel like she's becoming a lot more compassionate and empathetic towards my hypercube. She seems to really genuinely care about me and seems to be trying to make an effort to actually do things to minimize my pain. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I can sleep late. I can pray when I wake up.  I can try to do some brain exercises to help prepare me.  I can start doing research on my bill project and I can listen to a book for a while to relax. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	She fought for accommodations for people with chronic pain. She made the world more empathetic and sensitive to the needs of others. She changed the way the medical community treats patients with hyperacusis.  She stood up for the rights of flying people.  She tried to make the world a more equal and fair place. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I learned that my mom actually does have compassion and she loves me a lot and it if I tell her more like letting her know I'm in pain. Did she go to stuff to try to help me? So I just need you communicate my needs better. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I think I did a good job communicating my needs and my thoughts to miss Patel and I think I did a good job staying home today and told me when people said insensitive things about my hyperacusis, and I think I did a good job presenting facts and logic argument. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	If I could just have anything I wanted happened tomorrow, I would stay in my closet inside my soundproof bedroom all day and I would just come out to eat. My food will be brought upstairs to me and I wouldn't have to deal with me anymore your pain. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I did not like that. I have a B in my math class. I want to get an A in math tomorrow.  for my grade for my intern 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Tomorrow if it's too loud for me. I'm going to speak up and I'm not just going to sit there and pain. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I want to stay in my closet and rest so that I can get rid of my pain or decreases and I want to try to have a conversation with my mom about making accommodations in the house so that I don't have to go into the kitchen with all the noise. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Well, it's just really hard for me waking up every day and knowing that I'm going to be an even more pain as the day goes on. I'm all the noise at school.  And then on non-school days like over the summer knowing that Daddy's going to continue to push me to try to do things. There are too loud and painful for me and I just wanted to live a pain-free life and I'm just really sad knowing that the rest of my education. I'm going to be in pain from all the noises that I have hyperacusis a medical condition my experience physical pain from normal everyday sound. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I'm grateful that mrs. Chapman understood that I couldn't read 13 Pages straight. And so she said that they're going to read it to me because she understands that with my visual impairment. It's too much strain on my eyes. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Why would I feel thankful for a challenge? 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I'm feeling thankful for a lot of different people today. I'm feeling thankful for my mom who tried to make a lot of accommodations for me. And for the people at the NSB and bism who are really understanding about my hyperacusis. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Oh, yes. Definitely. I'm very thankful for my iPad Pro for my Vizio book for my active noise cancelling headphones and for my iPad Pro that I use at school and for my large calculator. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I would say the last time I push myself out of my comfort zone was when I went down to the kitchen to take my eye drops. The refrigerator was on and the refrigerator is painful for me because of my hyperacusis. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I'd have to say the last time push myself out of my comfort zone was a few hours ago when I was in physical pain preparing some of my plates to go on my tray for dinner cuz all of the silverware and plates felt like I was being stabbed in the temples and in the ears because of the new ones which is painful for me because of my hyperacusis. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I want to be there more often for my friends to Amelia because I know that she's suffering a lot cuz she has hyperacusis too, but hers is even more severe than mine. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Yes, I did the whole time. I was at school. I worked hard on my class work. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Not at all. I dread having to get up every day because I know I'm just going to be in more pain as the day goes on and I'm still always in pain from the previous day.  I don't like waking up in the morning. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I'm really longing for quiet and for people to understand my hyperacusis and just for my pain to go away. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I really wish I could be more Brave like today in English class. I just sat there in pain while my teacher played this audiobook cuz it was too loud for my hyperacusis.  I wish I could have said something. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	I just told you I really want my father and Miss Patel to better understand my hyperacusis, and I won't have a better relationship with Miss Patel. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Well, I would have to say my relationships overall have been improving with the school staff definitely was Miss Patel today. I had a meeting with her and she was being very empathetic about my hyperacusis, and she was even trying to help me come up with solutions to problems. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Well my relationship with my mom has been improving my relationship with my dad is not really good because he doesn't believe or understand me that my hyperacusis. You always makes very insensitive comments and laughs at me when I tell him about my pain and it's always trying to make me do things that are too high. 
x785Fh5FYCV7OfspQZBHCTbNYJ73	Well, I'm nervous because I have a doctor's appointment coming up next week with my neurologist Terre prosciutto and I'm concerned because I don't think she's aware that I have epilepsy because on some of the eegee's to seizures will not showing up and then the wonder what they did show up with them by other doctors when I just want to make sure that I'm being treated properly for whatever medical condition time 1/2. 
x7pAEURVXPbw1aDZQjiogPgrdZ93	Hey, how you doing? My name is Anthony.  How's your day going? 
x7pAEURVXPbw1aDZQjiogPgrdZ93	I hurt my wife.  feelings today  and hurt me a lot. I don't want to see my wife cry. 
x7pAEURVXPbw1aDZQjiogPgrdZ93	Getting a new job.  My wife getting a new job.  My son enjoying a new area.  And me Anthony.  Getting the job where I do not have to worry about someone letting me go.  My wife having a job where she feels happy and she has an autonomy. 
x7pAEURVXPbw1aDZQjiogPgrdZ93	Surprising moment was I decided to do what I'm supposed to do in and help my wife out at someone and clean the bathroom.  And she approaches him new Rags, but their specialty Rags, I did not know so I went use them with a chemical to clean the bathroom and I think I know I know I ruined the Talon their brakes pensive towels cuz they're their Specialties out like $3 for like 1 and my wife yelled at me and upset Me Maybe with drawn little bit depressed because I was trying to do the right thing and help her clean and it turns out I sort of was doing like I wasn't doing things the right way and I explain to my wife how much it hurt me her aggressiveness toward sort of meanness and and saying that and and not we understand that was trying my best. 
x7pAEURVXPbw1aDZQjiogPgrdZ93	I realize that I'm starting to why maybe I've always been paranoid. I'm just coming realizing and the paranoid is not making me a nice person that's making me a mean person and the second thing is I carry a knife only to cut boxes and things like that. But when I play around with the knife, it gives me the same idea gives me a certain it takes away any vulnerability and so I feel like not paranoid per se but I could do whatever when I feel secure again that makes me mean versus a nice person and you know the paranoid and in the night, I got to try to fix that somehow either stop carrying knives, or I don't know. 
x7pAEURVXPbw1aDZQjiogPgrdZ93	I probably shouldn't have dropped got into bed and got a little depressed while I can't control of that but I'm not really sure what I should have done other than a price going to grab the rag again. I didn't know they weren't supposed to be used with chemicals. My wife broke the point that I should have called her. But again, I wasn't going to call her because I didn't think I was doing anything wrong. 
x7pAEURVXPbw1aDZQjiogPgrdZ93	People that have bad attention to the people that don't want to be lonely no more.  I mean alternative motives they want to be withdrawn.  And do not want people close to them. 
x7pAEURVXPbw1aDZQjiogPgrdZ93	listening to music with my headphones on 
x7pAEURVXPbw1aDZQjiogPgrdZ93	I want to make today great. I want to I want I want to be with my wife emotionally.  I am connect reconnect.  Yeah, meaning to ask this man. Just want to I want to be with my wife when I connect. I want to feel comfortable. I want her to feel comfort with me. But in turn also, I want to feel comfortable with her that I'm not walking on eggshells and I don't want her to think she's walking on eggshells. So I just want our day to be the best. I possibly can. I have a great family time with Brandon. Tell Brandon that I'm here for him if he wants to do any practice before his tournament next weekend by my Air Force might just want to let him know I'm here if he needs to 
x7pAEURVXPbw1aDZQjiogPgrdZ93	Try not to be paranoid if then think that people are out to get me and treat them better, you know, and just just be relaxed around them and also vulnerable have difficulty being vulnerable people kiss for me and makes me feel like a mom born bro.

xiMSJyZF5QM8V6TcqEYHZdPSADJ3	Yeah I should and I do love everyone, I need to stop trying thinking like everyone and think like myself 
xiMSJyZF5QM8V6TcqEYHZdPSADJ3	I feel like even if I haven’t earned it I have the potential to,  or maybe all of my desires will come to me in the future I just have to work towards them, I don’t know what will happen in the future but I have to keep hoping that my desires and goals will unravel because I have no reason not to. 
xiMSJyZF5QM8V6TcqEYHZdPSADJ3	I’ve been focused on everyone else and not myself, I haven’t been thinking about what I want and what makes me happy I’ve been thinking about other people 
xiMSJyZF5QM8V6TcqEYHZdPSADJ3	Because I deserve better in life than the effect that letting my hope go would give me, I deserve all of my desires. 
xiMSJyZF5QM8V6TcqEYHZdPSADJ3	I am very creative.  And I give very good advice. 
xiMSJyZF5QM8V6TcqEYHZdPSADJ3	I’m incredibly thankful for my husband, it feels like he’s the only person in this world that understands me and that knows who I am, the real me. I love him more than anything else and I’m so incredibly thankful that he has come into my life and that I get to keep him for as long as we both shall live, to have someone love you and care that much about you Is amazing. He makes me feel as if I’m protected and nourished but while he’s doing that he makes me feel like I can do anything and that everything I’ve ever wanted i can get and a person like that doesn’t come easy, William my husband is who I am incredibly thankful for and I will always be incredibly thankful that he loves me and has come into my life to stay.

xiMSJyZF5QM8V6TcqEYHZdPSADJ3	No nothing really, I’ve always been myself nothing has really stopped me and nothing can stop me. Stress is just stress it’s nothing more 
xiMSJyZF5QM8V6TcqEYHZdPSADJ3	I’ve helped them realize who they are and who they can truly become 
xiMSJyZF5QM8V6TcqEYHZdPSADJ3	I’ve been given a chance to have all my dreams unfold in reality, but while doing that I’ve not lost myself and who I am. I am a dreamer and I have an imagination that can take on the world, I am kind and that helps me see the bigger picture when it comes to dealing with people every day, I am a brave and courageous person, I have integrity and I. Can never lose that because it’s apart of who I am and I can never lose myself. 
xiMSJyZF5QM8V6TcqEYHZdPSADJ3	I found answering the questions to be easy because I already knew the answers 
xiMSJyZF5QM8V6TcqEYHZdPSADJ3	I would feel like my life is complete, like I’ve lived the best way that I can and that is being myself. 
xiMSJyZF5QM8V6TcqEYHZdPSADJ3	Because I’m focused on everyone else’s lives instead of mine, because I’m stressed, I want to let things be the way they are so I can focus on the way that they can improvise. 
xiMSJyZF5QM8V6TcqEYHZdPSADJ3	I wasn’t feeling a different way, but I was stressed before which is not helpful 
xiMSJyZF5QM8V6TcqEYHZdPSADJ3	It’s important to keep moving forward because I don’t want to look back years from now or even months and regret what I didn’t do, I don’t want to look back at all. I want to be fulfilled with my life because I know that I can, I’ve been given a chance to change my life, make it better, and get everything I want . I’ve been given a family, a best friend, and the best man that I could ever ask for, the man that I’ve always wanted, the man that makes me a better woman. I refuse to let all of that go because of thoughts in my head that aren’t even my own, I am a strong, independent,kind, and ambitious woman and I will always be, I am Jasmine Stewart and no one and nothing can take that away from me. 
xiMSJyZF5QM8V6TcqEYHZdPSADJ3	I  perceive myself as a very loving and kind person, a very smart person who’s creative and hardworking, Who when wants something she go gets it without question. 
xiMSJyZF5QM8V6TcqEYHZdPSADJ3	Because we see a bigger picture than the picture that it laid out in front of us 
xiMSJyZF5QM8V6TcqEYHZdPSADJ3	I always know who I am and I always know who I want to to and who I can become. Stress is something that just frustrates me 
xiMSJyZF5QM8V6TcqEYHZdPSADJ3	I procrastinate around other people and I start thinking like them

yB7gpzw6ZaZBLoB3ntm5Ol5ORl03	I would say writing them down.  So that I can visually see what I have to do. 
yB7gpzw6ZaZBLoB3ntm5Ol5ORl03	I just want to come to some sort of Common Ground so that we can move on and  grow Stronger Everyday 
yB7gpzw6ZaZBLoB3ntm5Ol5ORl03	What I can use less of in my life. You're probably less negativity.  It's about to be 20 20 years. You know, I just have no more room for negativity in my life.  I can use less of that. Definitely. 
yB7gpzw6ZaZBLoB3ntm5Ol5ORl03	I don't know. I just  want to learn how to cope with things and deal with things better and just keep working on myself and find things.  To do that makes me happy.  for myself and my physical health and also most importantly my mental health because I tend to be in my head a lot and I'm learning to let go of things that occured in my past and  just move for forward in life and  be kind and be patient. 
yB7gpzw6ZaZBLoB3ntm5Ol5ORl03	Of course. I mean I do think that  sometimes it's not what you say. It's how you say it.  So I'm learning at 2. 
yB7gpzw6ZaZBLoB3ntm5Ol5ORl03	Yes, I think so. I didn't.  Read further, but I think they will help. 
yB7gpzw6ZaZBLoB3ntm5Ol5ORl03	Yes, I do. I feel like I'm a very hard on myself, but I'm learning to not be so hard on myself. 
yB7gpzw6ZaZBLoB3ntm5Ol5ORl03	working on myself  my Mi Mental Health 
yB7gpzw6ZaZBLoB3ntm5Ol5ORl03	Well at night I tend to think about everything that I need to do and just my life over all and you know, just a bunch of thoughts that come into my mind. 
yB7gpzw6ZaZBLoB3ntm5Ol5ORl03	I don't necessarily say I struggle with staying focused. I would say that my problem is.  I stay inside my head too much. 
yB7gpzw6ZaZBLoB3ntm5Ol5ORl03	discouraged  I'm hurt.  and upset 
yB7gpzw6ZaZBLoB3ntm5Ol5ORl03	Yes, definitely. I wish I could let go of  this anger and is hurt that I been kept bottled up. I think for some time now.  I just want to let it go. I don't want to be.  Angry towards life anymore. I don't want to be  This person that just keeps everything bottled in I want to have a better attitude towards life I guess. 
yB7gpzw6ZaZBLoB3ntm5Ol5ORl03	I would say.  fear of  success, I guess.  Like I feel like I'm way too hard on myself.  When I when I really shouldn't be because you know, whatever is meant for me is is going to be for me and is is I'm a you know, I'll already receive it. 
yB7gpzw6ZaZBLoB3ntm5Ol5ORl03	I probably would say.  I'm not taking the chance to spend time with my mother.  You always I mean you always just think that you have time with people and sometimes.  It's too late, you know, and so I wish I could have went.  I wish I could have Revisited dad and  I had a chance to spend more time with my mother before she passed away. 
yB7gpzw6ZaZBLoB3ntm5Ol5ORl03	I probably feel like I socialize too little.  I'm more of a private person. I don't really like being around a bunch of people but I will say that I could probably get a little better with that. But I want to surround myself with people that motivate me and people that you know, bring the best out of me. 
yB7gpzw6ZaZBLoB3ntm5Ol5ORl03	I spend the majority of my time with my son and my significant other I just love spending time with some they keep me, you know, they keep me going to keep me on my toes.  And they keep me laughing and you know just make me want to cherish life and cherish every moment that I get to spend with them. 
yB7gpzw6ZaZBLoB3ntm5Ol5ORl03	I'm more I'm more of a old-school person. So I like oldies like music from the late 90s. I meant the late 80s.  in the early 90s 
yB7gpzw6ZaZBLoB3ntm5Ol5ORl03	Some just being more of a friend. Most people don't know.  What being a friend means I'm including me. I think I'm still trying to figure out how to be more of a friend and try to understand people more and open up to people more. 
yB7gpzw6ZaZBLoB3ntm5Ol5ORl03	I probably would say my son. He keeps me going. He keeps me motivated. 
yB7gpzw6ZaZBLoB3ntm5Ol5ORl03	I basically just like tried to hang up the phone because I just didn't want to go through it anymore. 
yB7gpzw6ZaZBLoB3ntm5Ol5ORl03	Yeah being around my significant other in the people that I love has helped me quiet down a whole lot. 
yB7gpzw6ZaZBLoB3ntm5Ol5ORl03	Probably in the afternoon when I have to work. 
yB7gpzw6ZaZBLoB3ntm5Ol5ORl03	No, but I did get a slight headache. 
yB7gpzw6ZaZBLoB3ntm5Ol5ORl03	I would say more action less talkin. 
yB7gpzw6ZaZBLoB3ntm5Ol5ORl03	yeah, I was upset definitely upset because  I'll tend to wear my emotions on my sleeve a lot. Like I'm very emotional I get I can get very emotional soap.  Certain things can trigger me, I guess. 
yB7gpzw6ZaZBLoB3ntm5Ol5ORl03	I don't know. That's what I'm trying to figure out. 
yB7gpzw6ZaZBLoB3ntm5Ol5ORl03	Yes. Yes. I do need to acknowledge that you know, I have great potential and I just need to work harder and become a better person so that I can you know reach all my dreams and my goals to you know.  Everything I want to achieve in life. 
yB7gpzw6ZaZBLoB3ntm5Ol5ORl03	I think people want to be around me because I'm  I have a bubbly personality and I'm also very blunt. But I also like to you know, I have my my goofy side and I like to have fun and I like to laugh a lot. 
yB7gpzw6ZaZBLoB3ntm5Ol5ORl03	well, unfortunately my time with my mother has been cut short because  you know, she's in heaven now.  And I wish that I could.  Just hug her one more timing.  Spending quality time with her just one more time. 
yB7gpzw6ZaZBLoB3ntm5Ol5ORl03	I'm because it would have been the last time that you know, I would have gotten that opportunity. I just  wish that I could it'll tell her how much I love her one more time and  just get that motherly hug from her that I enjoy so much.  Yeah, I miss her. I miss her a lot. I think about her everyday. 
yB7gpzw6ZaZBLoB3ntm5Ol5ORl03	Well, I just recently recently lost my mother and it's been kind of hard for me to cope with that. So.  I'm just trying to take it day by day. 
yB7gpzw6ZaZBLoB3ntm5Ol5ORl03	I don't know. I used to care a whole lot about how others think of me and what others think of me when it comes to my life, but  I'm learning that you know, I have to I have to live for myself I have this is you know, this is my life. I have One Life to Live and you know, I want to live it to the fullest not saying that I don't take you know people's.  advice into consideration but at the end of the day  Is my life to live so I have to live it according to my happiness, you know. 
yB7gpzw6ZaZBLoB3ntm5Ol5ORl03	I probably would say by believing in myself more. I mean, I've always been confident but just not as confident as I should have been. 
yB7gpzw6ZaZBLoB3ntm5Ol5ORl03	Basically me and my significant other is just not seeing eye-to-eye about.  certain things and I'm just tired of  going through the motions.  I just  don't want to have arguments no more. 
yDkcRVjA0wVA1LqfRbwtHoP4WKr1	I feel like when people look for a job. You start to think about what you really want to do with your life. And it makes it seem stressful, but I don’t think it’s hard. 
yDkcRVjA0wVA1LqfRbwtHoP4WKr1	My boyfriend, he always help me. No matter how good or bad my day goes 
yDkcRVjA0wVA1LqfRbwtHoP4WKr1	A cashier recognized my black panther and captain America key chains

yE7fMoZKO2N5ecjdY9BrC5AXZqw2	Where do people tend to cool how when they are angry?  I'm not understanding. 
yE7fMoZKO2N5ecjdY9BrC5AXZqw2	I think that after these three years with the same cost and cycle the same loop. I think that the best thing for me right now is to be alone.  Because I have so much hurt in me that.  At this point. I just don't know how to deal with it anymore. And so  I'm really feeling like I need to be alone.  the current moment  I don't know how long because because I just never has just never fully healed from all the Hershey's put me through. 
yE7fMoZKO2N5ecjdY9BrC5AXZqw2	At the current moment.  The only thing I'm thinking about is  weather if  this relationship should end or not. 
yE7fMoZKO2N5ecjdY9BrC5AXZqw2	I do wish that the name, wouldn't have happened. But again when a person is angry, they're angry.  That's like  if a person cheats what is a other person supposed to do just sit there and take it in? No, that's pretty unfair, you know the same way.  She has a right to.  React and feel emotions. This is family. I have a right to react. I feel emotions as well. 
yE7fMoZKO2N5ecjdY9BrC5AXZqw2	Angry upset over pensive Furious. I'm just all types of emotions right now. 
yE7fMoZKO2N5ecjdY9BrC5AXZqw2	I told her that she was never going to change that if a person really wants to change their ways than they would do it, but I've been telling her the same thing over for 3 years now until this day. She has not stop lying to me. So it's pretty evident that she doesn't want to change.  North Navarro sells more for me nor for her own good, you know.  so I'm just  I just told her, you know, you're never going to change. This is you said that you want to be this person who lies all the time. That's not thank you. You just simply don't want to change. 
yE7fMoZKO2N5ecjdY9BrC5AXZqw2	I got Furious.  I passed out.  That's how I've been handling my problems with her.  Lately, I just lash out and I just say anything that crosses my mind. I call her name words. That one shouldn't be calling their partner. But when I'm angry as all that wants to come at me. 
yE7fMoZKO2N5ecjdY9BrC5AXZqw2	Hi there, my name is Jocelyn 
yEfdqI89VXWK3oT5N1K3HMCbrEQ2	Yes, when I tend to restrict myself from going out and doing things that are fun just because of the way I look and makes me nervous that in the future. My boyfriend's not going to want to live with someone like this and then I could really ruin the special bond that we have because of my decision making 
yEfdqI89VXWK3oT5N1K3HMCbrEQ2	The memories and moments. I could be spending with my family and boyfriend.  In the moments, I could be making in this young stage of life. 
yEfdqI89VXWK3oT5N1K3HMCbrEQ2	Sometimes I tend to isolate myself and not really go out because I have bad perception on my body and the way I look so I don't really like to go out. But when I do I surround myself with people that don't have any drama and just are supportive but the ones that you have drama and are super negative I tend to shy away from them. 
yEfdqI89VXWK3oT5N1K3HMCbrEQ2	I like to.  work out a lot and focus on my well-being always to be healthy and  Have a routine in my day to always be structure in a healthy mindset, but sometimes it tends.  Guys like me and not really.  2 best for my social well-being 
yEteUo4x1eSEtpzC9IGL7gTRbYf1	My parents, their amazing 
yEteUo4x1eSEtpzC9IGL7gTRbYf1	Today was not the best day at the least, my best friend Tommy cut open his finger and needed to get it glued shut, so I barely got to see him😢. He knows I like him as more than a friend now and he kinda basically rejected me🤣. Than I got hurt by my other best friend Gracie and now I can’t feel my hand, I can move it but I can’t feel it moving, and last but not least I’m getting bullied again. So my Day sucked🙁

yPrtC3hBNuZEjI5D9Qq9GQJJcEI3	Hey, I feel like I'm not that good at what I claimed to be good at.  It's just an experience a lot of failure and rejection and a lot of the things guided my identity around.  I might actually get up and it really isn't my sense of self.  You need to come better and put a discipline and training.  And tissue Connections in Prestige for a while until I just become so good. They can't ignore me. In fact, I feel the need to self punish relying on Connections in Prestige by isolating myself from connecting connections infestation to I'm good enough and I never want to seek these things again.

ySo6NK4W2RNdleD4pz0UGT801E62	When I woke up, I was sweaty scared and crying. 
ySo6NK4W2RNdleD4pz0UGT801E62	I'm not sure really most days are boring and the same I guess maybe hanging out with a friend or getting free food Christmas Eve dinner tonight. 
ySo6NK4W2RNdleD4pz0UGT801E62	Well, I'm at the house waiting for my little sister's to get off the school bus and a little girl comes to the door and makes me throw a birthday party and invite all my friends for whatever reason and she's young. She's got little pigtails and she's probably about 12 and she's very cute.  Anna  find vital my friends over and  she makes me make a sandwich that has poison pills in them and kill all of my friends and then I try to run away because when my sister's get home.  And I got on the bus and she somehow mind controls the bus driver to bring me back to the house and then they chased me with these lollipops that kill you if they touch you and then I woke up. 
ySo6NK4W2RNdleD4pz0UGT801E62	I don't know.  My child learn how to walk.  I mean  a new friend  a couple new friends  and that's about it. 
ySo6NK4W2RNdleD4pz0UGT801E62	I don't see anything yet.  I guess my phone. 
ySo6NK4W2RNdleD4pz0UGT801E62	The answer to that is no because I've been having this dream almost every year for as long as I can remember. 
ySo6NK4W2RNdleD4pz0UGT801E62	I choose to focus on Next Step not the entire pack. 
ySo6NK4W2RNdleD4pz0UGT801E62	Then the world would probably be a better place. 
ySo6NK4W2RNdleD4pz0UGT801E62	Because me and my boyfriend both don't have a job is mom is taking care of her fucking child and paying for all of his shit. We live in her house, and it's disgusting and fucking dirty.  He doesn't care about my mental health aide thinks it's all made up or doesn't exist and isn't real.

yZFb9VCaIAP80vEvO1yipzrk50V2	I can be a inspiration to others

yfFayoH7TASwuhZBYXi40kEb3U93	I would tell them about a pretty plant I like.

yfFayoH7TASwuhZBYXi40kEb3U93	"I work and study a lot. I used to paint and I really like plants and drugs.
If I were introducing myself, I would ask the other person what they do for work, I wouldn’t say much about myself."
yfFayoH7TASwuhZBYXi40kEb3U93	I’m trying to stop my obsessive, intrusive thoughts

ym26oD1DBDZH3y9pLGNikHZsHRb2	So it was good. We served at church from 7:45 until about 1:30. So it was a long day, but I do enjoy serving at church. So it was kind of boring where I was serving at church. That wasn't so good. And then the other good parts are we got to watch some TV as a family and that's always a good thing for me.  we have 
ym26oD1DBDZH3y9pLGNikHZsHRb2	I'm feeling pretty good. I mean we went to church was that so that was good and I had a meal plan with that was good and stay was basically a rest day. So it was good.

ym26oD1DBDZH3y9pLGNikHZsHRb2	My youngest daughter talking about her party at school and how excited and her face lit up.  And it also made me smile when she attempted to paint her own fingernails and didn't understand why we had to redo them.  It was a little bit heartbreaking at the same time and I would have let her keep them if we had not been doing family pictures.  But overall it made me smile. 
ym26oD1DBDZH3y9pLGNikHZsHRb2	I was just going from place to place looking for Mike McCoy because I found out that he was adopted and I needed to have a conversation with him, but  Once I found out what I found him.  And I was telling him he was adopted. He didn't even know that he was adopted. So it was kind of a weird dream. 
ym26oD1DBDZH3y9pLGNikHZsHRb2	My day's been good. I had lunch with a friend and then we had family pictures and we had a lot of fun and laughing with family pictures.  a lot of bluebirds shots  But also a few good ones as well and then we went to go look at Christmas lights and discovered that we are all Christmas light Christmas lights knobs. 
yosfoDXPpUeZqLKV4uaqaml0zcx2	I was looking for a journal. 
yosfoDXPpUeZqLKV4uaqaml0zcx2	Getting out of a relationship with a partner
yxJ1V1cOdEZfLAHZesHkLQL57Zt1	I just typed in Diary on the App Store. And this was the first thing that popped up. 
yxJ1V1cOdEZfLAHZesHkLQL57Zt1	I don't know. I guess it's cleaning count. 
yxJ1V1cOdEZfLAHZesHkLQL57Zt1	I kind of stay up, I just stay up tossing and turning.  Efforts is cuz a boy.  I want to see if if you text me.  now it's just like  I just wake up frequently.  a lot at night time

Hype music  What time does a call over?  all over the place  beverages  make me feel better I guess but then at the same time and doesn't cuz it's like what's that music goes away. There's nothing else left.  And then I'm left to think about everything that I didn't want to think about. 
yxJ1V1cOdEZfLAHZesHkLQL57Zt1	I've been going to work these past couple of days.  Not doing much.  Today I thought Sydney.  and I feel like kind of seeing her just brings up like a lot of emotions cuz  she's like my only friend.  I don't know if I'm trying to do.  The pros and cons of our relationship our friendship.  I don't know. It's just hard being around somebody that's always in a bad mood.  He really gets to you.  I don't know. It's like I don't want to just stop being her friend because  dislikes Lily boho move to pull but sometimes I just I can't.  Can do it.  nothing  I feel bad because  I just wish I had the answers.  How is this?  Somebody could just give me all the answers to life.  wrestler for this so hard  Everything was so much more simple than it is. 
yxJ1V1cOdEZfLAHZesHkLQL57Zt1	I'm feeling confused.  sad  I don't know. I just  I'm not feeling right. 
yxJ1V1cOdEZfLAHZesHkLQL57Zt1	so  I don't know a lot going on. I kind of don't want it and I wanted to stop talking to everybody.  I don't know. It's just because I'm going through my thing right now.  I'm just  I think I'm really tired and I just want to leave everybody alone. But then it's like it's also because I feel like I'm too dependent on people in.  It's not good cuz it's just like when I don't have those people then what like what am I supposed to do after that?  I don't like being like so depending on people.  Cousin is just like what I don't have those people that I'm sad because I pull with my supposed to do now.  Boo at the same time  It's not. Goodbye.

zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	If nobody else around me is better than me 
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	It’s very simple and subtle. It’s slow but sweet, telling the story of how someone feels enlightened from their partners presence. 
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	Today we’re some people’s birthdays and I got to continue reading some stories I’ve been reading lately 
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	I just started using the actual shoes, but I have been in the pointe program for two years now.
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	She was saying that me and my crush would make a cute couple
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	Very much. It has influenced my entire life, but also my mindset.
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	Some. He said that our routine was well-thought our and that we put a lot of time and effort into creating the routine.
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	They provide humor and positive feelings to the viewers. Depending on the video, people feel inspired or energetic or just joyful
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	I could try to make them laugh or talk about something we both take interest in
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	Just now, I suddenly discovered that this girl in my school dance class has an Instagram account. It has so many of her amazing accomplishments, such as competitions of state and already being on pointe. While I am fascinated by her talent, I am also quite jealous because I feel as though I am no where near her level.
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	Some new events that I could incorporate into my story.
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	I have seen huge leaps in progress in my pointe technique. Last week, I was really struggling to endure the pain of holding myself up on pointe. But yesterday, I felt much better and sustained less injuries
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	I thought of different ideas for future events I could incorporate in my story. I also began to think about a new plot that would work for a different story
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	I am well interested in Kpop because it has very much shaped who I think I am and what I want to be in the future. I am very passionate about dance, and it is one of the things in my life I actually look forward to doing. It is the one thing that I love to do and want to pursue.
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	I’m feeling more energized and laid-back than most days today. I could be because it’s someone’s birthday, or it could be because I’ve been watching many videos that contain the things I like
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	I am becoming closer to my true self every day
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	Watch funny videos or listen to upbeat music
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	A funny, on-task, and risk-taking person. I can achieve this by socializing with other people and trying to raise my hand in class, which is uncommon.
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	Working on our line dances. I actually think ours is coming along, even though ours is not the best. We only have one more eight count to cover, so I am very excited to finally start polishing our routine.
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	I can make them smile. I can do this by telling a joke, engaging in a conversation, or doing something silly
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	There’s this girl in my 3rd-period dance class at school, who is also a dancer like me. Just now, I discovered her Instagram account, which is filled with her achievements in dance. Although I am amazed and inspired, I also feel envious. It makes me believe that I am not a good dancer because of where she's at. She’s already on pointe and competes out of state, while I am just beginning pointe and only compete in 4 dance competitions, which are all in Sacramento.
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	I was talking to my friend through text messages. She was teasing me about my crush, saying how we’d be cute together, which made me feel giddy and bashful
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	My family and my relatives
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	Stay on task with my assignments and keep a smile on my face
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	Today I step towards becoming a person that thinks big and takes decisive actions.
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	Today and everyday, I will speak up and tell other what I want and need.
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	My day will be full of motivation, and my positive energy will motivate and lift those around me.
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	You’re perfect just the way you are. And if you're struggling, try to improve.
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	Dance competitions. I want to show my fullest potential, in hopes that we will place and get a high rank. I am also excited about the duet I am going to do because I will be choreographing it for the very first time.
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	I am very satisfied. I had good laughs in science class, got to retake a quiz from math, and covered a lot in my dance classes
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	A little bit. I worked on a chapter in my story, but only got a few paragraphs done throughout the whole day.
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	Yes. I was able to finish my assignment for my Social Studies class. 
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	Yes. I was able to work on our summative task routine, and my group mates were able to pick up very fast. I also got through more of my pamphlet for my English summative, although it wasn’t too much.
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	I just watched Cirque Du Soleil yesterday. It really gave me an inspiration to work on my flexibility, strength, and stage presence, so I am very thankful to have the opportunity to go.
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	Dance. Because of taking ballet, I have morphed into the person I am today. It has shaped who I am and what I want to do in the future. Dance is the only thing I look forward to doing everyday, and it is a big inspiration for me. 
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	I feel thankful that I feel energized and awake rather than drowsy and lazy when I first woke up
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	I very much struggle with knowing that I'm good enough. I get jealous very easily. If I see or hear something that I think is better than what I can do, I immediately begin to think that I’m not good enough and that I always need to remain on top.
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	To start off the day, I went to church with my family to attend the Sunday mass. Towards the evening, I got boba with my dad and sister while we played Crazy 8 together. Later, my aunt and younger cousin came over to visit as they were stopping by to drop off some jeans they were going to donate
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	I finally finished the routine we needed to make for my dance class. I also had fun chats with my friends during dance class and lunch. I even got to eat a “Mardi Gras” themed breakfast-dinner.
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	I would like to have a productive day. I have many projects and major assignments that I need to work on, such as English, Dance, and Social Science. I would not like to get left behind, so I need to stay on task throughout the day.
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	Yes. Just by watching my recent dance videos, there are so many things that are ruining my technique—bent legs, poor balance, weak arms, etc. When I look at others, they are perfect in every way, while I am still struggling, despite being complimented by my friends about my “skills.”
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	I feel grateful that I am actually making a great impact on my math teacher, because he complimented me on my math skills. Based on my general quiz scores, I thought he thought less of me because I usually was a B average on my quizzes. But today, he told me that he thought I was going to be a really good mathematician, even if it isn’t my strongest subject.
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	I am thankful for the joy I felt today. Often days, I don’t usually feel this way. Typically, I am more drowsy and sad, but today I was very energized and happy.
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	I am grateful that I am going to attend a BTS concert for the very first time in Santa Clara. Last year, we were unable to purchase tickets, and I wouldn’t even have been able to go since I had a dance competition on the day of the concert.
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	I want to try to ignore the others people whom I am jealous of today. Not as in completely turn my attention away from them, but ignore what they are doing that makes me feel less about myself. For example, I need to tell myself today that I have achieved so much because someone I know yesterday had a magazine photo shoot while I was washing a car
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	I just finished doing the dishes
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	I will make healthy decisions for my body today, because I am worth it
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	To learn how to love and appreciate my abilities.
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	Today is a BTS member’s birthday!
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	Whenever I’m in dance, I always envision what kinds of comments people would leave if a video of me dancing would be put on social media, like Youtube. I always get angry and criticize myself in my head, sometimes almost forcing me into tears. It makes influences the way I act around my dance friends and how I dance. Usually, when this happens, I become quiet and lose energy in my movements, becoming more flowy and weak. 
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	Because I’m watching videos with people who make me feel happy and keep me inspired
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	I usually give a smirk or try to act really smoothly about it
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	He saw the precision and cautiousness in my work because I took a lot of steps in order to solve the math problem
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	When my friend and I were able to choreograph a whole minute of the dance routine we’re doing for our dance competition
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	I was able to get along with my friends in dance class. Usually during the routine, they often good off and don’t listen. But today, they stayed on task and were able to practice the routine well. We even got a compliment from our teacher!
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	I am not good enough to receive such recognition by my peers in both my dance class and at school.
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	I want to break out of my unhealthy mindset so I can focus on knowing that I am good enough. 
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	It'll open doors for me—maybe I’ll want to continue choreographing dances, or maybe I will work at a dance studio when I turn 16. It’ll enhance my creativity and my dance skills, and also help me understand better how to learn from criticism.
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	I worked on the story I’m writing and watched some BTS videos to keep me happy
zA6bSJFY6YOM3Q8ftVegrhtOiv63	Today I got to work with my friend to create a duet for our dance competition. We covered a lot in just one hour and we had a lot of fun exchanging ideas and working together to choreograph a a little over a minute today.
zBX7zR8acSSAKzfNuV8KDnkZ18b2	Exhale my fears in breathe in confidence. 
zBX7zR8acSSAKzfNuV8KDnkZ18b2	My mom and dad. For bringing me into the world
zBX7zR8acSSAKzfNuV8KDnkZ18b2	I could be dead or in jail.
zBX7zR8acSSAKzfNuV8KDnkZ18b2	My life and decisions I make.
zBX7zR8acSSAKzfNuV8KDnkZ18b2	Because my girlfriend is in a really great mood.
zKovKwD8pme26thU4bQNG4kCU6d2	I don't know, but I do know love is the only answer to everything. 
zKovKwD8pme26thU4bQNG4kCU6d2	Why do I want to live today such as?  What question will get back to that one? 
zKovKwD8pme26thU4bQNG4kCU6d2	New ideas I had today.  Not really any new ideas to be honest with you.  that I can think of at least  sad about my Italy trip in June of 2020.  And we decided that we need to do more walking and exercising actually no idea. We're going to start Adkins January 1st. That's a new idea. 
zKovKwD8pme26thU4bQNG4kCU6d2	Sorry, just woke up when I see if I go to live today.  We'll see. 
zKovKwD8pme26thU4bQNG4kCU6d2	Well, you have done nothing today. I woke up at 8. I smoked I watch a little TV. Talk on the phone went back to bed for a load of laundry. Of course. I'm back to bed fell asleep.  Alexa wake me up to do laundry and I'll talk to Arlene just laying around sounding like a sloth. 
zKovKwD8pme26thU4bQNG4kCU6d2	I accomplished nothing today.  Well, I accomplished laundry. I'm doing laundry today. 
zKovKwD8pme26thU4bQNG4kCU6d2	I'm feeling grateful for my family and my my  Friend, I have a lot to be thankful for my job car.  My mom my sister my sister my niece nephew Iconia. I'm grateful for all of them my cousins.  tell  I've been very blessed in my life. 
zKovKwD8pme26thU4bQNG4kCU6d2	Tearing. I'm having strength of caring Arlene call that she was out. She lost your pen and I care so I got her an old cartridge in an old pipe thing so she could use so that's something I care. 
zKovKwD8pme26thU4bQNG4kCU6d2	Well, I only came over the other day and I met with her her boyfriend Marisol texted of course as it's Christmas.  So they're around. 
zO3yTh1fVvRVuE34iz4a76glyOF2	I hope every day because I asked them how was their day every day. So I hope they can do the same about me. But lately they haven't been and I've been in a very dark spot. 
zO3yTh1fVvRVuE34iz4a76glyOF2	No, because with every rainbow comes a little rain and with every rain comes a little thunder, so without thunder there would be no rainbows and that mean that would help all the bad stuff. There would be no good stuff. 
zO3yTh1fVvRVuE34iz4a76glyOF2	I don’t really know maybe because like I’m not as pretty as the other girls in our away a little bit
zO3yTh1fVvRVuE34iz4a76glyOF2	No, because they just don't want to do it themselves. 
zO3yTh1fVvRVuE34iz4a76glyOF2	Her brother her something else because I don't want to hurt somebody like me.  Because we could become best friends. I don't want to play them because I because if I said something about you.  And I will just be saying it to me because we have the same thing. 
zO3yTh1fVvRVuE34iz4a76glyOF2	No not the way I dress how much I weigh
zO3yTh1fVvRVuE34iz4a76glyOF2	No.  because  didn't deserve that and sometimes people live through it. 
zO3yTh1fVvRVuE34iz4a76glyOF2	I have to worry about school almost every day Monday Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday Friday is when I go to school and at home the first hour I get home. I have to do homework and a lot of other stuff while I'm at school. 
zO3yTh1fVvRVuE34iz4a76glyOF2	Some people say mean things to other people because they have something inside of them that they don't want to come Express. 
zO3yTh1fVvRVuE34iz4a76glyOF2	No.  And I know they wouldn't because if they believe in and say mean things about them being albino, then they are just saying something mean about them like if you do.  where  If you had brown hair and your boys someone else for their Brown here, then you would just be saying all the mean things. You said to them to yourself. 
zO3yTh1fVvRVuE34iz4a76glyOF2	Most of the girls are really skinny and pretty and all the girls all the boys want to be with them. 
zO3yTh1fVvRVuE34iz4a76glyOF2	No, but this time machine 3 minutes. 
zO3yTh1fVvRVuE34iz4a76glyOF2	Should not mean cannot because if you should not that doesn't mean you can't. 
zO3yTh1fVvRVuE34iz4a76glyOF2	I have been feeling thankful for my family and my best friends because if I didn't have him I wouldn't be here right now.  I am right now. 
zO3yTh1fVvRVuE34iz4a76glyOF2	I feel grateful to enjoy coming home under everywhere everyday. 
zO3yTh1fVvRVuE34iz4a76glyOF2	If humans I've never had to come to an end, then it would be terrible world because then we would have all the same people and everyone wants a little something new like if you had to eat pizza for every day of your life the first couple days it would be good because their finest pizza within a year or two and you will get so sick. So you get sick of life and then you've probably either kill yourself or make someone else kill you and then that would just be bad. 
zO3yTh1fVvRVuE34iz4a76glyOF2	If everyone was kind all the time, then it would be a hard world because with all rainbows comes a little rain. 
zO3yTh1fVvRVuE34iz4a76glyOF2	Don't ever got sick then it would be.  good world because then lets people would die because I'm like  I'd like a thousand Americans at least die from cancer. 
zO3yTh1fVvRVuE34iz4a76glyOF2	if people only sign black and white then  It would be better because then people would not hurt other people for what they wore because it would all be black and white or like what color?  hair or eyes or skin they had 
zO3yTh1fVvRVuE34iz4a76glyOF2	But it's not so we don't have to worry about it. 
zO3yTh1fVvRVuE34iz4a76glyOF2	If humans didn't need to eat food that will be good because then people could stop body shaming. 
zO3yTh1fVvRVuE34iz4a76glyOF2	And that would be amazing because people bully other people and hurt other people cuz they have more money than them but no one cares about money. 
zO3yTh1fVvRVuE34iz4a76glyOF2	Well today and I have a crush on this boy Davis because he like always makes me laugh and today he was like flirting with all the other girls and like I can tell he likes me but like and we both like each other but he would  go and flirt with other girls and it made me feel really self-conscious
zO3yTh1fVvRVuE34iz4a76glyOF2	Seeing my best friend Kylie for hearing my best friend Cheyenne. 
zO3yTh1fVvRVuE34iz4a76glyOF2	Guess I forgot am cuz I'm spending my money on valuable things. 
zO3yTh1fVvRVuE34iz4a76glyOF2	I'm very good at drawing but I stopped that because I just had too much on my plate but one day I want to read it and get better at it. 
zO3yTh1fVvRVuE34iz4a76glyOF2	Thing that brings me joy everyday is my best friend Lily Kali in Samoan. 
zO3yTh1fVvRVuE34iz4a76glyOF2	You need to assess.  Not hurting other people and being honest with themselves. 
zO3yTh1fVvRVuE34iz4a76glyOF2	It would be bad because you don't live in the past you want to live in the present. 
zO3yTh1fVvRVuE34iz4a76glyOF2	I wish I could Master personality Brothers not like school.  I wish I could Master drawing.  Now, I wish I could best her.  Braiding cuz I'm already very good at braiding but I wish I could Master it. 
zO3yTh1fVvRVuE34iz4a76glyOF2	I would probably take on stop being so self-conscious because I’m always so hard on myself about what I do and how I look like
zO3yTh1fVvRVuE34iz4a76glyOF2	Alcohol, that would be to lose more weight. 
zO3yTh1fVvRVuE34iz4a76glyOF2	I will probably choose Davis because he was really funny and makes me laugh. 
zO3yTh1fVvRVuE34iz4a76glyOF2	first wish would be that my best friends never lived me because  and my second wish  OPP  for my crush like me back because he's really unique and I really like him.  and my mother which would probably be  don't like anyone ever trying to beat me down again because I'm just going to go back up. 
zO3yTh1fVvRVuE34iz4a76glyOF2	I would probably change abuse and rapists and bullying. 
zO3yTh1fVvRVuE34iz4a76glyOF2	Yes, they probably would because a lot of people are albino and people bully albino kids and that's a terrible thing to do because they didn't choose to be albino. 
zO3yTh1fVvRVuE34iz4a76glyOF2	They will probably see my crazy side and I will probably love you. 
zO3yTh1fVvRVuE34iz4a76glyOF2	People usually bully other people because they have something wrong inside of them and they just want to get it all out of the month. So they express it by plane other people not just talkin about it. 
zO3yTh1fVvRVuE34iz4a76glyOF2	You have a lot because I have to deal with school and my friends and homework and home stuff and my pets.  Can't worry about drawing right now. 
zO3yTh1fVvRVuE34iz4a76glyOF2	I expect my friends if I'm sad or mad. I expect him to ask me. What is wrong. Just say suck it up and  What's today? 
zO3yTh1fVvRVuE34iz4a76glyOF2	Some people like that, fat and ugly and they're just as ugly as me. So sometimes I want to say the same thing to them, but I don't want to hurt anybody, but they are hurting me. So I think I have  be right but I don't want so I just shut my mouth. 
zO3yTh1fVvRVuE34iz4a76glyOF2	A lot of the girls in my grade don’t have it because they’re just naturally skinny and pretty
zQOM5c8komaddyoJjsH3UKCvlDs1	I guess it depends but  solving math has always been a stress reliever sometimes for me. It's just something.  I can do to take my mind off things and it's just always Clicks in my head easily compared to other subjects. 
zQOM5c8komaddyoJjsH3UKCvlDs1	I don't know what to think at figure things out in life math is just kind of one-way solution it straightforward. It's easy to solve. Most things are just know there's always one method that you can always get to the solution compared to life.
